However, the process through which such sustainable rejuvenation can be planned and pursued has been largely overlooked. In addition, available research about sustainable rejuvenation usually applies the triple bottom line framework while neglecting the fourth dimension of sustainability, time. The purpose of this study was to understand the motivations and perceptions of tourists regarding the sustainability of Sirmione (a tourism destination on Lake Garda, Italy) and to discuss the results with Sirmione's stakeholders and decision planners to identify priority interventions for sustainable rejuvenation. In recent times, Sirmione has undergone significant changes (related, for example, to the type of incoming tourists) and even if it is still ‘successful’, planners have started reflecting on the need for the town's rejuvenation. This study was approached through the two-tiered sustainability equilibria framework, which suggests a dynamic view of sustainability combining economic, environmental and social aspects with short-, long- and longer-term views. The study was based on data collected through a survey of 328 visitors to Sirmione and analysed through both descriptive statistics and contents analysis. The results of the survey served as the input for the subsequent collective learning process with local tourism operators. Through this process, Sirmione's destination planners were able to intercept weak signals about the evolution of visitor demand and competition. As a result, they developed a list of five priority interventions to implement through a strategic plan for rejuvenation while the destination is still successful. Embedded in the strategic plan were the two tiers of sustainability—economic, environmental and social, and short-, long- and longer-term perspectives. The results of this study contribute to highlighting the relevance of considering time (in addition to economic, social and environmental aspects) to explain the sustainable rejuvenation of a mature tourism destination. In addition, the study provides suggestions on the role of a destination's public and private actors to adopt a combination of initiatives to pursue sustainable rejuvenation. © 2019","Destination management; Longitudinal perspective; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainable development; Tourism destination; Visitor satisfaction","Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Endocrinology; Social aspects; Strategic planning; Surveys; Collective learning; Descriptive statistics; Longitudinal perspective; Social and environmental; Sustainability dimensions; Tourism destination; Tourist destinations; Visitor satisfaction; Sustainable development",,,,,"Agarwal, S., Restructuring seaside tourism: the resort lifecyle (2002) Ann.

This paper explores the process that outperforming managers used to detect and interpret weak signals. Interviews with 13 top-managers were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to allow the process to emerge. The findings confirmed earlier conclusions on perceptual filters that reduce the number and type of signals assessed. Contrary to earlier findings, the process was significantly altered to compensate for this loss in two ways. First, managers deliberately postponed their assessment of a weak signal by discussing it with people with distinct and second, some managers deliberately searched for signals that were unfamiliar and not fitting their mental model. The sample consisted of outperforming top managers, which raised questions about the generalizability of the findings in specific directions: are the alterations in the weak signal process exemplary for outperformers only, and how does its success compare to formal foresight methods. Finally, the findings have managerial relevance since they indicate how to detect and bring weak signals into the company before impact. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging change; Perception; Perceptual filter; Top manager; Weak signal",,,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., Scanning the business environment (1967), Macmillan New York; Anderson, M.H., Nichols, M.L., Information gathering and changes in threat and opportunity perceptions (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44 (3), pp. 367-387; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (000002), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic management (1979), Palgrave Macmillan UK London; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issue management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1 (2), pp. 131-148; Ansoff, H.I., Sullivan, P.A., Optimizing profitability in turbulent environments: A formula for strategic success (1993) Long Range Planning, 26 (5), pp. 11-23; Auster, E., Choo, C.W., Environmental scanning by CEO's in two Canadian industries (1993) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 44 (4), pp. 194-203; Auster, E., Choo, C.W., How senior managers acquire and use information in environmental scanning (1994) Information Processing & Management, 30 (5), pp. 607-618; Battistella, C., De Toni, A.F., A methodology of technological foresight: A proposal and field study (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (6), pp. 1029-1048; Beal, R.M., Competing effectively: Environmental scanning, competitive strategy, and organizational performance in small manufacturing firms (2000) Journal of Small Business Management, 38 (1), p. 27; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: Designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Association for information systems proceeding of the americas conference on information systems, , J.N.D.

Surprising events can be avoided by methods for monitoring and analyzing these signals, continually. These methods enable the detection process of potential threats and opportunities that may arise from those surprising events. While this strategic process is very useful, conventional methods for WS monitoring and analysis do not avoid cognitive and motivational problems that can harm the competitive intelligence capacity of organizations. The solution of these problems can be related to methods that allow conducting the detection process collectively, quickly and with the least effort, through the eventual support of automatic tools. Ontologies, for example, are computational artifacts that represent organizational knowledge whose features can be used in a conceptual system for classification of WS. The purpose of this work is to present such system, which also uses Web crawling, competitive forces and PESTLE analysis in the detection of threats and opportunities. A case example also is discussed showing that this approach can be used as a viable alternative to support surveillance of strategic discontinuities that permeate the organizational environment. © 2018","Competitive intelligence; Conceptual system; Knowledge representation; Strategic discontinuities; Weak signal",,,,,,"Almeida, F., Hirata, P., Entendendo e implantando um sistema de inteligência competitiva (2016) REGE - Revista de Gestão, 23 (2), pp. 111-122; Ansoff, H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H., From strategic planning to strategic management (1976), John Wiley & Sons Inc.

Expenditure growth on average is about 2.5% a year (OECD, 2015) most notably led by the impact of ageing population. One of the areas with the fastest growth due to the “ageing-boom” is that the senior care. Technology investment is necessary to cope with the surge of patients. Internet of Things is one of those solutions. Too few studies have analyzed the organizational impact of these technologies. We propose a model confounding organizational perspective and anthropology. We seek to understand how the diversity of technological tools can give meaning to their implementation in the organization. Based on experts' statements and analysing weak signals, we suggest three trends: the Internet of Things strengthens patients' autonomy; it fights against the negative image of Senior care and ensures continuity between homecare services and institutionalization. The Internet of Things strengthens the bureaucratic aspect of Senior care, which in certain respects sound like highly bureaucratic organization where control becomes dominant. The duty of monitoring, control and transparency is enhanced by disempowering professionals and changing the tasks of Senior care directors whose supervisory task has grown major. The Internet of Things can strengthen an opposite organizational model based on technical and human networks. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Anthropology of techniques; Connected objects; Organization; Senior care","Population statistics; Societies and institutions; Anthropology of techniques; Connected objects; Organizational impacts; Organizational modeling; Organizational perspectives; Senior care; Technological tools; Technology investments; Internet of things; aging population; bureaucracy; expenditure; Internet; organization; technological development",,,,,"Akrich, M., La construction d'un système socio-technique.

Unfortunately, controversies occur across many topics and domains, with great changes over time. This paper investigates neural classifiers as a more robust methodology for controversy detection in general web pages. Current models have often cast controversy detection on general web pages as Wikipedia linking, or exact lexical matching tasks. The diverse and changing nature of controversies suggest that semantic approaches are better able to detect controversy. We train neural networks that can capture semantic information from texts using weak signal data. By leveraging the semantic properties of word embeddings we robustly improve on existing controversy detection methods. To evaluate model stability over time and to unseen topics, we asses model performance under varying training conditions to test cross-temporal, cross-topic, cross-domain performance and annotator congruence. In doing so, we demonstrate that weak-signal based neural approaches are closer to human estimates of controversy and are more robust to the inherent variability of controversies. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Knowledge management; Semantic Web; Semantics; Inherent variability; Large scale conditions; Model performance; Neural classifiers; Semantic approach; Semantic information; Semantic properties; Training conditions; Websites",,,,,"Cho, K., Bengio, Y., Bahdanau, D., (2014) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, , arXiv preprint; Das, S., Lavoie, A., Magdon-Ismail, M., A Manipulation among the arbiters of collective intelligence: How Wikipedia administrators mold public opinion (2016) ACM Trans.

It assumes that people tend to take donation decisions more often when there is some 'social pressure' towards them, rather that when they are faced with the same case that requires donation, but privately. The whole study is going to be conducted in the focus of the social percolation theory. A survey is conducted to test the hypothesis. The group participating in the study is presented with a specific case which requires donation. In addition to the statistical analysis, two computer simulated models describing the percolation also took place. This study is expected to be of help, based on an innovative technology, to all the donations initiators including private and public charity institutions. The percolation perspective will give them indications in improving the procedure, convincing people donate. Furthermore, the simulation tool offers early (weak) signals if the donation theme will percolate through the special interest community by exceeding the probability threshold. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

To this day, many papers on this topic have been published. However, research so far has only dealt with specific aspects, but it has failed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research domain. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to organize existing insights and knowledge. The 91 relevant papers, published between 1997 and 2017, are analyzed for their distribution over time and research outlets. Classifying them by their distinct properties, we study the data sources exploited and the data mining techniques applied. We also consider eight different purposes of analysis, namely weak signals and trends concerning political, economic, social and technological factors. The results of our systematic review show that the research domain has indeed been attracting growing attention over time. Furthermore, we observe a great variety of data mining and visualization techniques, and present insights on the efficacy and effectiveness of the data mining techniques applied. Our results reveal that a stronger emphasis on search strategies, data quality and automation is required to greatly reduce the human actor bias in the early stages of the corporate foresight process, thus supporting human experts more effectively in later stages such as strategic decision making and implementation. Moreover, systems for detecting weak signals and trends need to be able to learn and accumulate knowledge over time, attaining a holistic view on weak signals and trends, and incorporating multiple source types to provide a solid foundation for strategic decision making. The findings presented in this paper point to future research opportunities, and they can help practitioners decide which sources to exploit and which data mining techniques to apply when trying to detect weak signals and trends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Big data;

However, it is an under-researched area within the context of smart factories. For the purpose of the study, semi-structured group interviews were used to investigate how managers at a smart factory, a highly innovative global supplier in the automotive industry sense weak signals, perceive the role of intuition, smart systems and business model adjustments. The results of the study show that managers perceive early warning systems as highly important for timely response to development changes and that both smart systems and intuition play an essential role in detecting and responding to weak signals. Based on this study, we propose a managerial early warning system model with four stages, namely, identifying, screening, appraising and responding to weak signs, within the context of a smart factory. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","behavioral economics;

However, despite their inherent advantages (e.g., increasing the flexibility of supply chains), feedforward controls remain underdeveloped in the pharmaceutical distribution sector, largely due to the tediousness of identifying applicable anticipatory indicators. To properly anticipate the achievement of business objectives, in our in-depth case study of a Swiss wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products we relied on the notion of weak signals as conceptualized by Ansoff to develop a conceptual framework of feedforward. We identified a weak signal that showed more occurrences of error when less versatile employees were involved in executing tasks. The standard operating procedure for customer complaint management was recently adapted to include a feedforward control based on the weak signal. © 2018 IEEE.","error occurrence; feedforward control;

Firstly, the method is used for ""focusing"" correlation inversion detection and analysis of high-frequency abnormal signal components of defect stress. Then, three detection steps are adopted sequentially: multi-scale slice-type defect information extraction process, multi-scale ""focused"" correlation inversion based defect information extraction process, sub-dimensional selection and fusion based signal enhancement extraction process. Finally, the characteristic signals of small defects in wood are effectively separated to realize effective analysis and high-precision detection of local abnormal defects and other signals. The method has obtained good experimental simulation results: the identification accuracy of wood defects such as joints and holes is more than 97%.Experimental simulation and practical application show that this method has good spatiotemporal efficiency and detection accuracy. © 2018 SHPMedia Sdn Bhd.

The author defines innovations as ongoing processes of changes in the various fields of social and economic life, which result from human creative activity. Noting that innovation is an uncertain, relatively chaotic, and disordered process characterized by inherent risks, the author aims to define the most general and universal barriers impeding one's ability to recognize the signs of future innovation and to anticipate their consequences. Considering examples of ""disruptive innovation"" in the technological, social, political, and economic spheres of life, the author sees these innovations as arising from certain condition and events, not as simple random occurrences. Most of them are effects of particular causes. However, these causes are often hidden within events that are difficult to observe and phenomena encapsulated in weak signals. The inability to detect and recognize such pre-emerging warnings of upcoming innovations may be attributed to the massive amount of information and noise flooding today's world. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of knowledge, techniques, and experience for dealing with huge amounts of information, the lack of the required skills, and, finally, by human cognitive biases. Faced with this deluge of misinformation, any person can eventually be misled and make mistakes. This paper posits that, in order to mitigate such risks, an individual must avoid the three cognitive biases: the symmetry of delusions, aggressive neglect, and the curse of knowledge. These cognitive biases are the barriers to foreseeing innovation. © 2018 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

In this paper, the applicability of weak signals and wild cards is experimented in a case of a highly reliable and conservative sector, water and sanitation services. The aim is to explore an approach suitable for water utilities. The paper discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches to weak signals and wild cards, and reflects these in relation to the chosen approach. It is argued that the process of weak signals and wild cards can serve as a communication and reflection exercise for an organisation like a water utility. Furthermore, incorporating weak signals and wild cards can be an essential part in futures thinking, challenge prevailing mental models, and make systems more open to sense and learn from their environment. It is recommended for water utilities to apply a loose approach on weak signals and wild cards and embed it as a part of their organisational culture. However, it should be remembered that the approach should always be chosen to match the overall objectives and context. © 2017, The Author(s).","Water and sanitation services; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Hiltunen, E., (2010) Weak signals in organizational futures learning, , Aalto University School of Economics, Dissertation; Miller, R., Rossel, P., Jorgensen, U., Future studies and weak signals: a critical survey (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 195-197; Holopainen, M., Toivonen, M., Weak signals: Ansoff today (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 198-205; Mendonça, S., Cardoso, G., Caraça, J., The strategic strength of weak signal analysis (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 218-228; Rossel, P., Early detection, warnings, weak signals and seeds of change: a turbulent domain of futures studies (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 229-239; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The big picture – trends, drivers, wild cards, discontinuities and weak signals (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 292-312; Cevolini, A., The strongness of weak signals: self-reference and paradox in anticipatory systems (2016) Eur J Futures res, 4, pp. 1-13; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Slaughter, R.A., A new framework for environmental scanning (1999) Foresight, 1, pp. 441-451; Popper, R., Foresight methodology (2008) The Handbook of technology foresight: concepts and practice, pp. 44-88. , Georghiou L, Harper JC, Keenan M, Miles I, Popper R, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision making (2009) Technol Anal Strateg, 21, pp. 307-320; Pieper, K.J., Tang, M., Edwards, M.A., Flint water crisis caused by interrupted corrosion control: investigating ""ground zero"" home (2017) Environmental Science & Technology, 51, p. 2007; Saritas, O., Proskuryakova, L., Water resources – an analysis of trends, weak signals and wild cards with implications for Russia (2017) Foresight, 19, pp. 152-173; Nafday, A.M., Strategies for managing the consequences of black swan events (2009) Leader Manag Eng, 9, pp. 191-197; Kahneman, D., (2011) Thinking, fast and slow, , Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York; Taleb, N.N., (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, , Random House, New York; Heino, O.A., Takala, A.J., Katko, T.S., Challenges to Finnish water and wastewater services in the next 20–30 years (2011) E-Water, 1, pp. 1-20; Dominguez, D., (2008) Handling future uncertainty - strategic planning for the infrastructure sector, , Dissertation, ETH Zurich; Meadows, D.H., Wright, D., (2008) Thinking in systems: a primer, , Chelsea Green, White River Junction; Rognerud, I., Fonseca, C., van der, K.A., Moriarty, P., (2016) IRC trends analysis, 2016–2025; Ravetz, J., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2011) ERA toolkit: applications of wild cards and weak signals to the grand challenges & thematic priorities of the European research area, , Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, University of Manchester; Swyngedouw, E., (2004) Social power and the urbanization of water: flows of power, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Castro, J.E., Systemic conditions and public policy in the water and sanitation sector (2009) Water and sanitation services, pp. 19-37. , Castro JE, Heller L, (eds), Earthscan, London; Slaughter, R.A., From forecasting and scenarios to social construction: changing methodological paradigms in futures studies (2002) Foresight, 4, pp. 26-31; Miles, I., Harper, J.C., Georghiou, L., Keenan, M., Popper, R., The many faces of foresight (2008) The Handbook of technology foresight: concepts and practice, pp. 3-23. , Georghiou L, Harper JC, Keenan M, Miles I, Popper R, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting strategic management, , Prentice/Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Könnölä, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., van Rij, V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39, pp. 208-221; Moijanen, M., Heikot signaalit tulevaisuuden tutkimuksessa.

The world is a complex system and the rapid change among its sub-systems builds up pressure for any efforts to anticipate change and shape the processes of transformation. Surprise is an intrinsic aspect of change, in particular when it takes place at an accelerating pace with high degrees of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity (VUCA) - or within the condition of post-normality as described by Ziauddin Sardar. Emerging technologies such as AI and renewable energy systems add to the complexity of societies, and thus to the world of VUCA and post-normality. In foresight horizon scanning has much focused on the probable or even predictable -surprise-free developments. More emphasis should be paid on systematic anticipation of wild cards and black swans, and on the analysis of weak signals. Foresight should also focus on discontinuities - broader phenomena and developments instead of single events. Energy is a complex issue. Without energy there is no life, neither biological nor economic. Taking into account the huge ecological and social costs of the present energy system, the need for a new emission-free, cost-effective, and democratised energy system is obvious. An energy transformation to reach 100% renewable energy is envisioned in four transformational neo-carbon energy scenarios. Energy is increasingly a societal and even cultural issue - above all a security issue. As regards energy security, various sudden events and surprises could play a major role. New energy systems themselves, with other new technologies, nudge the world into unknown, discontinuous directions. Therefore, we probe the resilience, anti-fragility and discontinuity of these transformational, societal energy scenarios. The results of a futures clinique where the scenarios were tested are presented. Implications of surprises for energy security, as the world increasingly seeks to move towards a renewable energy based society, are explored. © 2017, The Author(s).","Black swans; Complexity; Discontinuity; Energy security; Renewable energy; Resilience; Transformative scenarios; Turbulence; Uncertainty; Wild cards",,,,,,"Aven, T., Implications of black swans to the foundations and practice of risk assessment and management (2015) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 134, pp. 83-91; Aven, T., On the meaning of a black swan in a risk context (2013) Saf Sci, 57, pp. 44-51; Last, C., Human metasystem transition (HMST) theory (2015) J Evol Technol, 25 (1), pp. 1-16; Osti, G., Frames, organisations, and practices as social components of energy (2012) Int Rev Sociol, 22 (3), pp. 412-428; Lord, B., (2014) Art & Energy: how culture changes, , The AAM Press, Arlington; Naam, R., (2011) Smaller, cheaper, faster: Does Moore's law apply to solar cells?

This study proposes an approach to novelty-focused weak signal detection from online futuristic data. For this, first, text mining is applied to extract signals in the form of keywords from futuristic data. Second, a local outlier factor is utilized to assess the rarity and paradigm unrelatedness of signals. The futuristic data is considered a source of weak signals and patent data is utilized as a proxy for existing paradigms of technological innovation. Finally, signal-portfolio maps are developed to identify the patterns of signal representations. The proposed approach helps broaden the source of weak signals and improve the sensitivity to the detection of weak signals.

However, instead of having direct access to the information, farmers usually acquire information from local social networks, and, thus, they may have very different information channels. We establish a general framework that accommodates highly asymmetric information structures to study farmers' information management and utilization problems. In our model, a bipartite graph describes which subset of signals is accessible to a farmer. We characterize a unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium and express farmers' strategies and expected profits in closed form. We discuss properties of this equilibrium and show that asymmetric information structures can lead to various novel results. For example, a farmer may produce more (less) when observing a pessimistic (optimistic) signal, may benefit from the improvement of a signal she cannot observe, may want to share her signal with others, and may become worse off when another farmer releases a signal to her. We conduct comprehensive studies on the equilibrium in the “weak signal limit,” where signals are subject to substantial noise. We examine the government's optimal information allocation in this limit when its goal is to maximize farmers' total profits or the social welfare. To improve farmers' total profits, the government should provide all its information to (and only to) one farmer. We establish an index to determine which farmer should get the information. In contrast, to maximize the social welfare, the government should provide all its information to all farmers. © 2016 Production and Operations Management Society","information management; not for profit; social network; socially responsible operations",,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Dahleh, M.A., Lobel, I., Ozdaglar, A., Bayesian learning in social networks (2011) Rev.

It is based on the ontology of a technology trend, hype cycles methodology, and semantic indicators which provide evidence of a maturity level of a technology. This approach forms the basis for implementation of text-mining software tools. Algorithms behind these tools allow users to escape from getting too general or garbage results which make it impossible to identify promising technologies at early stages (early detection, weak signals). Besides, these algorithms provide high-quality results in extraction of complex multiword terms which correspond to technological concepts forming a trend. Methodology and software developed as a result of this study are applicable to various industries with minor adjustments and require no deep expert knowledge from a user. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","early detection; emerging trend; full text analysis; hype cycle; knowledge extraction; maturity level; ontology; promising solution; semantic indicator; Technology trend monitoring; weak signal",,,,,,"Ahn, S.-H., An evaluation of green manufacturing technologies based on research databases (2014) International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing.

This phenomenon, known as “convergence”, leads to emerging industry segments and offers a wide array of opportunities for synergies. Against this background, a significant emphasis has been put on anticipating technology convergence as well as identifying and understanding the changing innovation patterns and industry structure associated with convergence. The timely recognition of converging technological fields enables the innovating enterprises to exert a positive influence on the changing value-chain. This paper introduces a refined methodological approach for the anticipation of converging technology areas based on the concept of knowledge flow. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to the areas of Nutraceuticals and Functional Food (NFF), Nanotechnology and Wearables. Our results indicate that the emerging technology convergence can be expressed by the concept of “weak signals”. The indices derived from the proposed approach are capable of uncovering the relationships between the individual technological sectors and provide numerical metrics to measure the presence of converging technologies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Functional food; IPC co-classification; Knowledge flow; Patent analysis; Technological convergence; Wearables","Functional food; Technology transfer; Wearable technology; Converging technologies; Emerging technologies; Knowledge flow; Methodological approach; Patent analysis; Technological convergence; Technology convergence; Wearables; Patents and inventions; food industry; industrial structure; industrial technology; innovation; knowledge; property rights; technology adoption",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

We chose the milk market as a case study, in line with the recent call from the EU Commission for governance tools which help to better address such highly volatile markets. Furthermore, on the first of April 2015, the new Common Agricultural Policy ended quotas for milk, which led to a milk crisis in the EU. Thus, we collaborated with milk experts to get their inputs for a new model to analyse the competitive environment. Consequently, we constructed graphs to represent the major factors that affect the milk industry and the relationships between them. We obtained several network measures for this social network, such as centrality and density. Some factors appear to have the largest major influence on all the other graph elements, while others strongly interact in cliques. Any detected changes in any of these factors will automatically impact the others. Therefore, scanning ones competitive environment can allow an organisation to get an early warning to help it avoid an issue (as much as possible) and/or seize an opportunity before its competitors. We conclude that Strategic Early Warning Systems as a corporate foresight approach utilising graph theory can strengthen the governance of markets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate foresight; Graph theory; Milk market; Scanning; Scenario analysis; Strategic Early Warning System","commodity market; corporate strategy; crisis management; early warning system; European Union; governance approach; graphical method; milk; scenario analysis; France",,,,,"Organizations make strides in adoption of analytics, but struggle to capitalize on investments.

This is a qualitative study in which individual and focus-group interviews were conducted in a Swedish context with occupational health care specialists, managers, and HR experts. The results suggest that organizational solutions have failed and continue to fail at controlling workers' health problems, although the main difficulty is not in identifying the 'right' individually oriented weak signals. Rather, it is upper management's reliance on formal information (e.g., statistics and surveys) - because of the difficulty in supplementing it with informal information (e.g., rumors and gossip) - that makes it difficult to improve traditional health and safety work.","Formal information; Informal information; Occupational health services; Qualitative; Weak signals",,,,,,"Ahnmé Ekenryd, C., Nylund, K., Jensen, I., Eklund, J., (2012) Forskning och utveckling inom företagshälsovården-behov och förutsättningar [Research and development in occupational health-needs and conditions], , Stockholm: Karolinska Institutet; Alvesson, M., Beyond neopositivists, romantics and localists: A reflexive approach to interviews in organizational research (2003) Academy of Management Review, 28, pp. 13-33. , http://dx.doi.org/10.5465/AMR.2003.8925191; Andriessen, J.H.T.H., Safe behaviour and safety motivation (1978) Journal of Occupational Accidents, 1 (4), pp. 363-376. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0376-6349(78)90006-8; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/41164635; (2016) Lag och rätt: Arbetsmiljölagen, , [Law and rights: Workplace Law]; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE; Cunha, M., Chia, R., Using teams to avoid peripheral blindness (2007) Long Range Planning, 40, pp. 559-573. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lrp.2007.08.004; Day, G., Schoemaker, P., Peripheral vision: Sensing and acting on weak signals (2004) Long Range Planning, 37, pp. 117-121. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lrp.2004.01.003; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2011) The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research, , Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE; Gallagher, C., New directions: Innovative Management Plus Safe Place.

In particular, the systematic scanning of external expert opinions has been shown to be effective for the early detection of emerging threats and opportunities in an organization's environment. However, organizations tend to focus on internal advice more than on advice from external experts. This can be critical for organizations if it leads to an inertia in internal judgment, resulting in blind spots or a failure to see weak signals in the firm's periphery. In this article, we introduce a structured framework for the collection and structuring of internal and external expert judgment. This so-called 360∘ Stakeholder Feedback tool provides a structured and quantitative approach for the detection and discussion of blind spots and weak signals in scenario planning processes. Thus, it can contribute to a better and more holistic judgment in the strategic process. We demonstrate the methodology based on a case from the German construction industry, in which we aggregate and analyze expert judgments from different stakeholder groups regarding the future of the industry. © 2015 International Institute of Forecasters","Expert judgment; Scenario planning; Stakeholder feedback",,,,,,"Aspinall, W., A route to more tractable expert advice (2010) Nature, 463 (7279), pp. 294-295; Bolger, F., Rowe, G., Delphi: Somewhere between Scylla and Charybdis?

Design/methodology/approach: In the first part, upon introducing corporate foresight from the two process and content perspectives, influential elements in this construct are discussed. Then, corporate foresight’s relationship with innovation and strategic decision-making is examined and its effect on organizational performance is analyzed within a structural model. Using interview and questionnaire, the data research were collected from the banking industry of Iran including 30 banks (state-commercial banks, specialist-state banks, interest-free loan funds and private banks). Through descriptive, inferential statistical analyses and structural equation modeling using SPSS and Smart PLS software, reliability of the measurement model with 576 samples was confirmed. Findings: The results show that the corporate foresight playing three roles of initiator, strategist, and opponent affects the innovation. Moreover, the research results suggest that using the data from the foresight and identifying the weak signals, we can reduce the uncertainty and issue prior warnings in order to enhance the quality of manager’s strategic decision making and promote the organizational performance.

The subject owes its relevance to the fact that traditional (classic) approaches to the strategic management of the operation and development of present-day enterprises within the high-tech sector are failing to align with the latest trends and cannot be used under conditions of non-linearity and stochastic changes within the framework of the current economic cycle and techno-economic paradigm. The inferences derived from this research study substantiate the advisability of using the methodological concept of foresighting for the purposes of strategic planning and managing the development of high-tech enterprises. Based on the findings of this study, the authors come to the following conclusions: foresighting is a relatively new tool for the strategic management of the innovation development of high-tech enterprises. That being said, considering that foresighting may involve the various public forces and employ the various channels for up-and-down communication between the entrepreneurial, scientific and public-governmental spheres, with decisions being focused on the long run, there is potential for a much wider scope of the search for and deployment of strategic benchmarks for the development of high-tech enterprises. The methodological concept of foresighting the innovation development of high-tech enterprises makes it possible to change the strategic adaptive approach to forecasting and planning their activity into the strategic constructive one. Sequential implementation of stages in foresighting makes it possible to determine the outline and alternative dimensions of the innovation development of high-tech enterprises through the use of special technology (horizon scanning and weak signal detection) and conduct the selection of promising projects, which, if implemented, will help achieve the goals set by the company.","Foresight project; Foresight research; Foresighting; High-tech enterprises; Innovation development; Roadmap; Strategic management; Strategy for innovation development; System of innovation management",,,,,,"Battistella, C., The organization of corporate foresight: A multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Brummer, V., Konnola, T., Salo, A., Mnogoobrazie v forsait-issledovaniyakh: Praktika otbora innovatsionnykh idei [Diversity in foresight: Insights from the fostering of innovation ideas] (2010) Foresight, 4 (4), pp. 56-68; Coates, V., Farooque, M., Klavans, R., Lapid, K., Linstone, H.A., Pistorius, C., Porter, A.L., On the future of technological forecasting (2001) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 67 (1), pp. 1-17; Cuhls, K., Johnston, R., Corporate foresight (2008) Future-oriented technology analysis: Strategic intelligence for an innovative economy, pp. 103-114. , In C.

The author directly connects the recent rise of corporate foresight with MNCs' growing need to fill the gaps in traditional corporate strategic management, which struggles with the challenges of today's global turbulent business-environment (known as VUCA world characterised by unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity). From this perspective, corporate foresight is capable of providing a number of viable responses. They include the significant expansion of the horizon of MNCs' long-term future vision, enhanced capabilities of business-environment scanning (identifying not only clearly visible trends but the so-called weak signals as well) and strengthening intra-firm communications over the course of the strategy development process, thus contributing to the implementation capacity of the multinational corporate team. Within the analysis of the actual corporate foresight practices of major multinationals, special attention is paid to the common features of foresight organisation (standard process phases, the typical set of methods used) and peculiarities related mainly to different MNCs' sector-specific environment characteristics, including the complexity and dynamics of change. An attempt is also made to describe the actual impact of corporate foresight activities on the effectiveness of the key functions of MNCs' strategic management. The author draws the conclusion that corporate foresight is becoming a core element of the strategic management architecture of multinational businesses, striving to protect and strengthen its global market positioning in an increasingly turbulent and unpredictable environment. For MNCs' top management, trying to find the right strategic course in a radically changing competitive landscape, this powerful tool is increasingly playing the same role as a GPS navigator for drivers lost in an unfamiliar city.","Corporate foresight; Corporate strategic management; Multinational corporations; Strategic positioning in global markets; Turbulent global environment",,,,,,"Ansoff, I., (1965) Corporate Strategy, , New York: McGrow-Hill; Ansoff, I., (1979) Strategic Management, , London: Macmillan; Ansoff, I., Declerck, R.P., Hayes, R.L., (1976) From Strategic Planning to Strategic Management.

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, best international practice was analyzed that provided a solid basis for Russian S&T Foresight 2030 (section “Nanotechnology and new materials”). The study used a wide range of advanced Foresight methods adapted to Russian circumstances. During the Foresight study, the authors integrated “market pull” and research “technology push” approaches including both traditional methods (priority-setting, roadmaps, global challenges analysis) and relatively new approaches (horizon scanning, weak signals, wild cards, etc.). Findings: Using the methods of the Foresight, the authors identified trends with the greatest impact on the sphere of nanotechnology and new materials, promising markets, product groups and potential areas of demand for Russian innovation technologies and developments in this field. The authors assessed the state-of-the-art of the domestic research in the area of nanotechnologies and new materials to identify “white spots”, as well as parity zone and leadership, which can be the basis for integration into international alliances and positioning of Russia as a center of global technological development in this field. Originality/value: The results of applying Foresight methodology toward revelation of the most prospective S&T areas in the field of nanotechnologies and new materials can be used by a variety of stakeholders including federal and regional authorities, technology platforms and innovation and industrial clusters, leading universities and scientific organizations in formulation of their research and strategic agenda. Russian businesses including both large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises can use results of the study in creating their strategic R&D programs and finding appropriate partners. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advanced materials; Convergence; Foresight; Nanotechnologies; NBIC technologies; New materials",,,,,,"Nanotechnology (2006) The Industrial Revolution of the 21st Century; (2004) Nanotechnology Foresight in Asia-Pacific, , The APEC Center for Technology Foresight, Bangkok; (2008) Energy and Nanotechnologies: Strategy for Australia’s Future, , Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, Melbourne; Batra, V.S., Li, H.P., Oxygen carrier materials and their role in chemical looping reactions for fuel conversion (2017) Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering, 15, pp. 44-48; Cuhls, K., Blind, K., Grupp, H., Delphi ’98 umfrage (1998) Zukunft Nachgefragt, , (Eds Studie zur globalen Entwicklung von Wissenschaft und Technik, Karlsruhe (in German); (2010) Research Road Mapping in Materials, , European Commission, Brussels; Di Sia, P., Analytical nano-modelling for neuroscience and cognitive science (2014) Journal of Bioinformatics and Intelligent Control, 3 (4), pp. 268-272; Diallo, M.S., Brinker, J.C., Nanotechnology for sustainability: environment, water, food, minerals and climate (2011) Nanotechnology Research Directions for Societal Needs in 2020: Retrospective and Outlook, pp. 221-259. , Roco, M.C., Mirkin, M.C. and Hersham, M.and (Eds), Science Policy Reports, Springer, Dordrecht; (2010) US Department of Energy Critical Materials Strategy, , Department of Energy, The United States of America, Washington, DC; (2006) Roadmaps at 2015 on Nanotechnology Application in the Sectors of Materials, Health & Medical Systems, Energy, , AIRI / Nanotec IT, Roma; Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: an action plan for Europe 2005-2009“ (2009) Second Implementation Report 2007-2009, , http://cordis.europa.eu/nanotechnology/actionplan.htm, (accessed, 6 April 2016, Commission of the European Communities, Brussels; The global nanotechnology and nanomaterials industry: stage of development (2013) Global Activity and Market Opportunities; (2014) Nanomanufacturing: Emergence and Implications for US Competitiveness, the Environment, and Human Health, , www.gao.gov/assets/670/660591.pdf, (accessed, 25 February 2016, United States Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC; Goh, P.S., Ismail, A.F., Review: is interplay between nanomaterial and membrane technology the way forward for desalination?

Previous attempts of data-driven technology roadmaps have mainly focused on data from such sources as patents and literatures. However, as these sources catalogue posteriori trends of evolution, roadmaps based on these data cannot be counted on to predict disruptions. In this regard, futuristic data in technology foresight websites may provide a better source. The objective of this research, in response, is to develop a support system for technology roadmapping that uses futuristic data. To this end, we suggest keyword-based visual scanning approach involving three keyword maps, used in succession: keyword cluster map, keyword intensity map, and keyword relationship map. Particularly, keyword intensity map is designed using weak signal theory which can help identify the visibility, diffusion, and interpretation of signals. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","futuristic data; Technology roadmapping; visual analysis; weak signal","technological development; visual analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, (2), pp. 21-34. , citeulike-article-id:1109593; Cable, J.H., Ordonez, J.F., Chintalapani, G., Plaisant, C., (2004), “Project Portfolio Earned Value Management Using Treemaps.” Proceedings of the Project Management Institute Research Conference, London; Cachia, R., Compañó, R., Da Costa, O., Grasping the Potential of Online Social Networks for Foresight (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74 (8), pp. 1179-1203; Choi, S., Kim, H., Yoon, J., Kim, K., Lee, J.Y., An SAO-Based Text-Mining Approach for Technology Roadmapping Using Patent Information (2013) R and D Management, 43 (1), pp. 52-74; Christensen, C.M., Baumann, H., Ruggles, R., Sadtler, T.M., Disruptive Innovation for Social Change (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (12), pp. 94-101; Davies, D.L., Bouldin, D.W., A Cluster Separation Measure (1979) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine IntelligencePAMI-1, (2), pp. 224-227; Drew, S.A.W., Building Technology Foresight: Using Scenarios to Embrace Innovation (2006) European Journal of Innovation Management, 9 (3), pp. 241-257; Flexer, A., On the Use of Self-Organizing Maps for Clustering and Visualization (2001) Intelligent Data Analysis, 5 (5), pp. 373-384. , IOS Press; Geum, Y., Lee, H.J., Lee, Y., Park, Y., Development of Data-Driven Technology Roadmap Considering Dependency: An ARM-Based Technology Roadmapping (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 91, pp. 264-279. , Elsevier Inc; Hamel, G., (2002) Leading the Revolution: How to Thrive in Turbulent Times by Making Innovation a Way of Life, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Hiltunen, E., The Future Sign and Its Three Dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Jeong, Y., Yoon, B., Development of Patent Roadmap Based on Technology Roadmap by Analyzing Patterns of Patent Development (2015) Technovation, 39-40 (May), pp. 37-52; Kim, J., Park, Y., (2014), “Supporting Technology Foresight for Disruptive Innovation : Keyword-Based Visual Analysis for Futuristic Data.” Proceedings of the Asia Pacific Industrial Engineering & Management Systems Conference 2014, Jeju, South Korea; Kohonen, T., The Self-Organizing Map (1998) Neurocomputing, 21 (1-3), pp. 1-6; Kostoff, R.N., Boylan, R., Simons, G.R., Disruptive Technology Roadmaps (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 141-159; Lee, S., Lee, S., Seol, H., Park, Y., Using Patent Information for Designing New Product and Technology: Keyword Based Technology Roadmapping (2008) R&D Management, 38 (2), pp. 169-188; Martin, H., Daim, T., Technology Roadmapping through Intelligence Analysis: Case of Nanotechnology (2008) International Journal of Society Systems Science, 1 (1), pp. 49-66; Mendonça, S., Cardoso, G., Caraça, J., The Strategic Strength of Weak Signal Analysis (2012) Futures, 44 (3), pp. 218-228; Morris, S., DeYong, C., Wu, Z., Salman, S., Yemenu, D., DIVA: A Visualization System for Exploring Document Databases for Technology Forecasting (2002) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 43 (4), pp. 841-862; Paap, J., Katz, R., Anticipating Disruptive Innovation (2004) IEEE Engineering Management Review, 32 (4), pp. 74-85; Pang, A.S.K., Futures 2.0: Rethinking the Discipline (2010) Foresight, 12 (1), pp. 5-20; Park, H., Kim, K., Choi, S., Yoon, J., A Patent Intelligence System for Strategic Technology Planning (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (7), pp. 2373-23790; Phaal, R., Farrukh, C.J.P., Probert, D.R., Technology Roadmapping – A Planning Framework for Evolution and Revolution (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 5-26; Rossel, P., Weak Signals as a Flexible Framing Space for Enhanced Management and Decision-Making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21 (3), pp. 307-320; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The Big Picture – Trends, Drivers, Wild Cards, Discontinuities and Weak Signals (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 292-312; Schatzmann, J., Schäfer, R., Eichelbaum, F., Foresight 2.0 – Definition, Overview & Evaluation (2013) European Journal of Futures Research, 1 (1), pp. 1-15; Shneiderman, B., Dunne, C., Sharma, P., Wang, P., Innovation Trajectories for Information Visualizations: Comparing Treemaps, Cone Trees, and Hyperbolic Trees (2012) Information Visualization, 11 (2), pp. 87-105; Vesanto, J., Himberg, J., (1999), “Self-Organizing Map in Matlab: The SOM Toolbox.” The Matlab DSP Conference 1999, 35–40.

Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive search, big data-based mate recommendations, and varying levels of anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to check out a potential mate's profile while not leaving any visible online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates ""weak signals"" of interest for their potential mates that may play an important role in establishing successful communication. We run a randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited, in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated by a corresponding increase in quality of matches.

Although research has examined frameworks and concepts that lead to high-quality performance, few studies examine how to sustain high-quality performance. Sustaining performance may require additional capabilities from what it takes to achieve it. Drawing on quality management literature, organizational resilience literature, and the theory of dynamic capabilities in the strategy literature, this study empirically investigates the effects of four capabilities that help sustain high-quality performance. The analysis shows that capabilities in improvement, innovation, sensing weak signals, and responsiveness all help sustain high-quality performance. This suggests that what it takes to achieve high-quality performance is different, in part, from what it takes to sustain it. The data comes from a survey of 147 manufacturing business units. The analysis shows that the relative benefits of these capabilities may depend on the level of competitive intensity and environmental uncertainty. The findings provide empirical support for a theoretical model and practical guidance for sustaining quality performance. © 2016 Decision Sciences Institute","Dynamic capability; High reliability; Quality management; Resilience; Sustaining performance",,,,,,"Ahire, S.L., An empirical investigation of quality management in small firms (1996) Production & Inventory Management Journal, 37 (2), pp. 44-50; Ahire, S.L., O'Shaughnessy, K.C., The role of top management commitment in quality management: An empirical analysis of the auto parts industry (1998) International Journal of Quality Science, 3 (1), pp. 5-37; Aiken, L., West, S., (1991), #x0026;, Multiple regression Testing and interpreting interactions, Newbury Park, CA, Sage; Bagozzi, R.P., (1994), Advanced methods of marketing research, Cambridge, MA, Blackwell Business; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Benson, P.G., Saraph, J.V., Schroeder, R.G., The effects of organizational context on quality management: An empirical investigation (1991) Management Science, 37 (9), pp. 1107-1124; Berry, L.L., Parasuraman, A., Listening to the customer-the concept of a service-quality information system (1997) Sloan Management Review, 38, pp. 65-76; Bode, C., Wagner, S.M., Petersen, K.J., Ellram, L.M., Understanding responses to supply chain disruptions: Insights from Information processing and resource dependence perspectives (2011) Academy of Management Journal, 54 (4), pp. 833-856; Bodek, N., Green, J., (2011), #x0026;,).

It soon became clear that this is counter-phase oscillation of AA and TT, or rather of RR and YY - by a version of multiple alignment («synchronous detection» in signal processing). The campaign incrementally agonized through reconstruction of signal from its parts, N-gram Shannon extension and strong nucleosomes (SNs) with visible sequence periodicity to (RRRRRYYYYY)n pattern, and culminated in this form, with small changes suggested by consensuses from strong nucleosomes. 10-11 base YR dinucleotide periodicity (first suggested by Zhurkin) is a part of the above consensus. The periodically repeating YR elements form long tracks of hundreds to thousands base-pairs indicating that the chromatin consists of columnar structures, rather than of solitary nucleosomes. In particular, the classical SV40 minichromosome appears to form one continuous column. © 2016 IEEE.","601 clone of Lowary/Widom; Chromatin columns; Strong nucleosomes; SV40 minichromosome; Techniques for sequence signal extraction; YR tracks","Chromosomes; DNA sequences; Signal processing; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; 601 clone of Lowary/Widom; Nucleosomes; Signal extraction; SV40 minichromosome; YR tracks; Stochastic models",,,,,"Bettecken, T., Trifonov, E.N., Repertoires of the nucleosomepositioning dinucleotides (2009) PLoS ONE, 4, p. e7654; Dubochet, J., Adrian, M., Schultz, P., Oudet, P., Cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified SV40 minichromosomes: The liquid drop model (1986) The EMBO Journal, 5, pp. 519-528; Fajkus, J., Trifonov, E.N., Columnar packing of telomeric nucleosomes (2001) Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 280, pp. 961-963; Finch, J.T., Klug, A., Solenoidal model for superstructure in chromatin (1976) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the, 73, pp. 1897-1901. , USA; Frenkel, Z.M., Bettecken, T., Trifonov, E.N., Nucleosome DNA sequence structure of isochores (2011) BMC Genomics, 12, p. 203; Frenkel, Z.M., Trifonov, E.N., Volkovich, Z., Bettecken, T., Nucleosome positioning patterns derived from human apoptotic nucleosomes (2011) J Biomolec Str Dyn, 29, pp. 577-583; Gabdank, I., Barash, D., Trifonov, E.N., Nucleosome DNA bendability matrix (C.

Thus far, the attacks on mass transport have been about twice as lethal as terrorist attacks overall. Mass transport systems are typically of open design layout with multiple access points, and these characteristics make the process of screening challenging. Therefore, the early identification of an attack plan is the most efficient way to protect such systems. This paper aims to better understand the attack phenomenon and to develop a new approach for the systematic identification of possible weak signals and their sources. If such weak signals can be timely detected and correctly interpreted, this could improve awareness and thus possibilities for intervention. The developed approach is demonstrated by applying it to two well-known but different cases: the Tokyo sarin attack of 1995 and the 2005 London bombings. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Mass transport; Terror attack; Weak signal","Mass transfer; Transportation; Damage scenarios; Multiple access points; Safety and securities; Systematic identification; Terror attacks; Terrorist attacks; Transport systems; Weak signals; Terrorism; identification method; public transport; signal processing; technology adoption; terrorism; transportation system",,,,,"Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

Yet, the exact implications of complexity science for FS remain somewhat opaque. This paper explicitly sets out the challenges for FS that arise from six complexity science concepts: (1) irreversibility of time (2) path dependence 3) sensitivity to initial conditions (4) emergence and systemness (5) attractor states (6) complex causation. The discussion highlights the implications of these challenges for FS tools such as horizon scanning and weak signals, and sets out the benefits of overcoming the challenges to create an explicitly complexity-orientated FS. The discussion concludes with a set of questions summarising the challenge for FS from complexity science with the aim of stimulating a discussion as to how they can be met. The concluding remarks make some initial suggestions in this regard. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Complexity science; Emergence; Futures Studies; Horizon scanning; Scenario planning; Uncertainty; Weak signals","complexity; future prospect; planning process; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Multi-ontology, sense-making and the emergence of the future (2009) Futures, 41, pp. 279-283; Aiginger, K., The great recession vs. the great depression: stylized facts on siblings that were given different foster parents (2010) Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment e-Journal, 4; Aldred, J., Climate change uncertainty, irreversibility and the precautionary principle (2012) Cambridge Journal of Economics, 36, pp. 1051-1072; Almunia, M., Benetrix, A., Eichengreen, B., O'Rourke, K.H., Rua, G., From great depression to great credit crisis: similarities, differences and lessons (2010) Economic Policy, 25, pp. 219-265; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 28, pp. 28-33; Arthur, W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by small historical events (1989) Economic Journal, 99, pp. 116-131; Arthur, W.B., (2009) The nature of technology: what it is and how it evolves, , Penguin, London; Axtell, R., The complexity of exchange (2005) The Economic Journal, 115, pp. F193-F210; Ayres, R.U., Axtell, R., Foresight as a survival characteristic: when (if ever) does the long view pay?

RTI Foresight practitioners need to complement their well developed set of technology oriented methods with equally sophisticated approaches tackling societal aspects of innovation. In this paper we aim to make a contribution to this requirement. Building on user innovation theory we argue that demand oriented RTI Foresight needs to systematically integrate voices and hypotheses from the fringes of the innovation system. In order to develop a sound approach for this we set out from well established Foresight theory on ""weak signals"" and ""cognitive biases"". Adopting a constructivist stance towards such signals leads us to the need to set up a socially robust, diverse discourse on ""seeds of change hypotheses"". We then outline a practical implementation of such a discourse in the context of the recent Foresight process of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany. We describe and discuss the experience of this Foresight process and suggest avenues for further development of the approach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive biases; Demand oriented RTI policy; Innovation policy; Lead user theory; Perception filters; Seeds of change; Weak signals","innovation; research; technology policy; theory; Germany",,,,,"Aichholzer, G., The Austrian foresight programme: organisation and expert profile (2001) International Journal of Technology Management, 21 (7-8), pp. 739-755; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, XVIII, pp. 21-33; Bijker, W.E., Law, J., (1997) Shaping technology/building society.

Activation of this sort of data and its further transformation into useful information (knowledge) allows to anticipate future environment variables and record early symptoms of potential changes in the plan of a project. The concept of weak signals is the starting point for constructing an early warning system as a tool for monitoring possible threats in a control system of production projects execution. An important element of early warning of imbalances/disruptions is a module monitoring production processes. Wear and tear diagnostics of a control system of production project execution requires a systemic approach. The purpose of this article is to present solutions dedicated for constant monitoring of machinery and equipment in a production system, as well as the flow of materials and information in processes. Therefore, a synthetic approach was proposed, based on the use of measuring systems risk analysis, and the earned value method which allows to control the project completion stages (work progress). Early identification of weak signals, their proper assessment and estimation of a forecast of future conditions require taking appropriate real-time actions. Proactive steps translate into effectiveness of production projects execution.

The paper presents selected issues concerning the project knowledge management, early warning systems, the concept of weak signals, as well as risk analysis. There is a need for their synthesis in order to efficiently recognize the potential opportunities and threats in the project life cycle. The proposed model of an early warning system based on knowledge integrates the elements of the theory and solutions unprecedented in project management. The basic idea is that the system should provide information concerning situations that threaten the implementation of projects, about dangerous phenomena and processes as well as the probability of their development. The system should allow rapid and flexible response to the forthcoming events, which in turn should translate into faster adaptation to adverse situations arising during the implementation of the project. It is proposed to assign prediction of threats with the identification of project risks in the form of a rule-based expert system. The capture of potential opportunities constitutes at this stage of the study only an added value and does not prejudge the functionality of the proposed system.

Technology trends such as additive manufacturing (""3D printing"") and the Internet of Things with its applications such as Industrie 4.0 in production technology are seen by companies as both major opportunities and threats to their business models on an abstract level, yet the identification and especially evaluation of specific technologies impacting a company's business in the future is still difficult. Disruptive technologies threaten market incumbents as these technologies enable addressing new or latent customer requirements or evaluation dimensions in a given market rather than improving on the fulfillment of existing evaluation criteria. When the value customers place on requirements and evaluation criteria (i.e. The evaluation context) changes, this can lead to rapid devaluation of products or services using traditional technologies. Technology Scanning is the technology intelligence sub-discipline responsible for finding weak signals of technological trends, and as we conjecture also for finding signals on technology-driven impeding changes in evaluation contexts in relevant markets. To do so, Technology Scanning uses a toolbox of methods including forecasting, scenario analysis, and trend analysis methods. We have previously stated the need for practitioners to have a framework of design recommendations for technology scanning based on the specific company's strategic goals on the identification of disruptive technologies, and outlined a research agenda on providing such a framework. As part of this research agenda, in this paper we present an overview of requirements for identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies in a company's context, and give an analysis of existing methods and design options (processes, organizations etc.) for technology scanning regarding these requirements. We proceed to outline a method to systematically detect possible changes in evaluation contexts to assist identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies using cross-industry analogies. We find that concepts from technology intelligence need to be complemented with concepts from market intelligence and environmental scanning to properly evaluate upcoming disruptive changes.","Disruptive Technologies; Technology Intelligence; Technology Scanning","3D printers; Commerce; Industrial management; Scanning; Three dimensional computer graphics; Customer requirements; Design recommendations; Disruptive technology; Environmental scanning; Production technology; Technological trends; Technology intelligence; Technology scanning; Environmental technology",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E.J., (1990) Implanting Strategic Management, , 2nd ed.

This research advances knowledge on the practice of foresight in long-term planning through a comparative analysis of planning approaches in two organisations linked through common ownership. Data generated from planning documentation and the foresight practice of strategy personnel in the two cases (transport and banking) provided support for a dynamic model of foresight integrated LT planning. The ongoing collection and synthesis of strong and weak signals, and their continual assimilation into scenarios depicting alternative futures was structurally supported by a community-of-practice. The community-of-practice widely engaged strategists located across organisational levels in conversations about emerging futures and about strategies through which to engage those futures. The findings encourage managers and researchers to view long-term planning as an ongoing interrogation of implemented and envisioned strategies within emerging, alternative futures. Such an approach stimulates strategic entrepreneurship and prepares the organisation for engaging in future environments. © 2013.","Community-of-practice; Foresight; Long-term planning","Technological forecasting; Community of practice; Comparative analysis; Foresight; Long term planning; Organisational level; Research advances; Strategic capability; Weak signals; Innovation",,,,,"Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, 1. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; Ofek, E., Wathieu, L., Are you ignoring trends that could shape up your business?

In the past decades, classical stochastic resonance (CSR) method is presented to enhance the fault detection of rolling element bearing. Aiming at identifying the bearing characteristic frequencies in the spectra, SR normalized scale transform has been proposed based on parameter-tuning bistable SR model by us. Based on our former work, this paper presents a new method via averaged stochastic resonance (ASR) to enhance the result of rolling element bearing fault detection furtherly. Simulations are made to validate the effect of the weak signal detection method of ASR. Moreover, two bearing fault enhanced detection strategies of CSR and ASR are investigated. Normal and seeded outer race fault bearings vibration signals from a test rig are processed and analyzed using the two methods, and the results are compared.","Averaged stochastic resonance; Bearing fault detection; Nonlinear bistable system; Normalized scale transform","Bearings (machine parts); Circuit resonance; Fault detection; Magnetic resonance; Mathematical transformations; Resonance; Signal detection; Stochastic systems; Vibration analysis; Vibrations (mechanical); Bearing characteristic; Bearing fault detection; Nonlinear bistable system; Periodic components; Rolling Element Bearing; Scale transform; Stochastic resonances; Weak signal detection; Roller bearings",,,,,"Donald, L.B., Chaotic oscillators and CMFFNS for signal detection in noise environment (1992) IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2, pp. 881-888; Hu, N.Q., Wen, X.S., The application of duffing oscillator in characteristic signal detection of early fault (2003) Journal of Sound and Vibration, 268 (5), pp. 917-931; Qu, L.S., Lin, J., A difference resonator for detecting weak signals (1999) Journal of Measurement, 26 (1), pp. 69-77; He, Z.J., Wavelet transform in tandem with autoregressive technique for monitoring and diagnosis of Machinery (1996) Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering (English Edition), 9 (4), pp. 311-317; Hu, N.Q., Min, C., Wen, X.S., The application of stochastic resonance theory for early detecting rub-impact fault of rotor system (2003) Mechanical System and Signal Processing, 17 (4), pp. 883-895; XiaoFei, Z., NiaoQing, H., Lei, H., Zhe, C., Multi-scale bistable stochastic resonance array: A novel weak signal detection method and application in Machine fault diagnosis (2013) Science China, Technological Sciences, 56 (9), pp. 2115-2123; Benzi, R., Sutera, A., Vulpiani, A., The mechanism of stochastic resonance (1981) Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General, 14 (11), pp. 453-457; De-Chun, G., Gang, H., Xiao-Dong, W., Experimental study of signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic resonance systems (1992) Physical Review A, 46 (6), pp. 3243-3249; Gammaitoni, L., Stochastic resonance (1998) Reviews of Modern Physics, 70 (1), pp. 223-287; Franaszek, M., Simiu, E., Stochastic resonance: A chaotic dynamics approach (1996) Physical Review E, 54 (2), pp. 1298-1304; Bulsara, A.R., Moss, F.E., Single neuron dynamics: Noise-enhanced signal processing (1991) IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 1, pp. 420-425. , Singapore; Zhang, X.F., Hu, N.Q., Cheng, Z., Enhanced detection of rolling element bearing fault based on stochastic resonance (2012) Chin J Mech Eng, 25 (6), pp. 1287-1297; Zhang, X.F., Hu, N.Q., Hu, L., Stochastic resonance in multi-scale bistable array (2013) Phys Lett A, pp. 981-984; Zhang, X.F., Hu, N.Q., Hu, L., Enhanced detection of bearing faults based on signal cepstrum pre-whitening and stochastic resonance (in Chinese) (2012) J Mech Eng, 48 (23), pp. 83-89","Hu, N.; School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense TechnologyChina; email: hnq@nudt.edu.cn",,,"COMADEM International",,,,,13637681,,,,"English","Int.

On the one hand it considers the external approach, that is, the analysis of visible signals linked to the emerging issues that in an early stage are called ""weak signals"". On the other hand, it tries to study emerging issues taking into account their internal motivations. In this case the aim is to value the social, economic or other kind of reasons that are hidden under emerging issues. A post-structuralism perspective (CLA, causal layered analysis) is used to address this objective.This double approach allows to consider emerging issues in a holistic way, taking into account what is visible and what is not so apparent. In order to offer conclusions and results a real use case is included analyzing the emerging issues showed in the report ""Informe de la Sociedad de la Información 2013"" (one of the references about information society situation and ICT trends in Spain). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CLA; Emerging issues; Igor Ansoff; SIE2013; Weak signals","assessment method; information and communication technology; Spain",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., (1975), 18 (2). , Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals California Management Review; Ansoff, I.H., Using weak signals (1984) Implanting strategic management, p. 20. , Pretince/Hall International Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Ashley, D.B., Project Risk Identification Using Inference Subjective Expert Assessment and Historical Data, The State of the Art in Project Risk Management (1989) International Project Management Association, Proceeding 1989, pp. 9-25; Battistella, C., The organisation of corporate foresight: a multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Beer, S., (1972) Brain of the firm, allen lane, , The Penguin Press, London; Brabandere, L., (2005), pp. 52-55. , False endings, weak signals; putting together the odd pieces of information that could save your business, Across the Board; Coffman, B., Weak signals research (1997) Part I: introduction, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak signals research (1997) Part II: information theory, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak signal research (1997) Part IV: evolution and growth of the weak signal to maturity, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Daheim, C., Uerz, T., Corporate foresight in Europe: from trend based logics to open foresight (2008) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 20 (3), pp. 321-336; Groddeck, V., Schwarz, J.O., Perceiving megatrends as empty signifiers: a discourse-theoretical interpretation of trend management (2013) Futures; Harris, D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals, detecting the next big thing (2002) The futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-2129; Heijden, K., (1997), Scenarios, Strategies, and the Strategy Process.

However, due to the increasing turbulence and dynamic complexity that characterize today’s competitive arenas, such systems need to be combined with simulation-based methodologies in order to improve entrepreneurial learning processes and, as a result, better detect possible crisis symptoms and weak signals of change—emerging from the business environment—to promptly react. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to show how a combination of traditional management control mechanisms with system dynamics modelling can effectively lead to better results in terms of SMEs’ performance measurement and management. As a result, a Dynamic Performance Management approach will be illustrated and discussed, also through an empirical application to a real small business. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Case-study; Dynamic Performance Management; Management control; Simulation; SMEs; System dynamics modelling",,,,,,"Bianchi, C., Introducing SD modeling into planning & control systems to manage SMEs growth: A learning-oriented perspective.

The theory postulates a set of technologies and practices that are unique to each wave. Although a challenge of the Kondratieff wave theory is great variance in interpretations about the timing of the waves among scholars, based on several analyses we suggest that with the financial crisis of 2008, and resulting economic instability, we are experiencing the end of the fifth wave and the emergence of the sixth. We take as our starting point the global trends, particularly those of scarcity and the rising cost of commodities such as energy and raw materials that have led to a widely shared hypothesis that resource productivity will be the key driver of technology and economic growth in the next wave. Socially, this driver will be fortified by growing environmental concerns since climate change and the destruction of natural ecosystems seem inevitably to proceed. Both these sources are boosting a generation of new companies and behaviour. In this article our focus is to evaluate weak signals that point to possible directions for the future of organisational practices in the sixth Kondratieff wave. We ask what will be the effects of the changing socio-technical landscape on the working life and organisational culture. The K-waves theory explains how certain ways of organising that have so far developed in the fringes of organisational culture may move into the mainstream, as a product of the systemic restructuring that has often accompanied the new K-wave. We present our findings from a workshop with representatives of five different resource efficiency oriented organisations in the Silicon Valley area. Based on the data we have gathered through the workshop and complementing interviews, we show how organisations base their considerations about the future to a surprisingly large extent on ethical arguments. Our material also includes a case that shows that this ethical approach is not self-evidently related to the aim for resource efficiency. We evaluate our results in the Future Sign - framework presented by Hiltunen. The signals we have gathered are combined with corporate shared value - thinking, and both are interpreted through the Kondratieff - wave theory. Based on our sample of five cases, along with a framework that supports our interpretation, we suggest the ethical motivations as backbone of organisations is a relatively strong future sign that has potential for strengthening in the sixth wave context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethics; Future sign; Kondratieff waves; Resource efficiency; Sixth wave; Social change","economic growth; economic instability; economic theory; ethics; future prospect; socioeconomic conditions; technological development; theoretical study",,,,,"(2014), http://www.ge.com/about-us/ecomagination, See; (2014), http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/, See; (2014), http://rt.com/usa/google-billion-solar-power-457/, See; (2014), http://www.givesomethingback.com/; (2014), http://www.newleafpaper.com/; (2014), http://www.shareable.net/; (2014), https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome; (2014), http://www.vinestove.com/; Arthur, W.B., The second economy (2011) McKinsey Quarterly, , https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/The_second_economy_2853; Ayres, R.U., Technological transformations long waves part I (1990) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 36, pp. 111-137; Ayres, R.U., Technological transformations long waves part II (1990) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 37, pp. 1-37; Barnosky, A.D., Hadly, E.A., Bascompte, J., Berlow, E.L., Brown, J.H., Fortelius, M., Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere (2012) Nature, 486, pp. 52-58; Braudel, F., (1996) The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II, , University of California Press, Berkeley; Brynjolfsson, E., McAfee, A., (2011) Race against the machine: How the digital revolution is accelerating innovation, driving productivity, and irreversibly transforming employment and the economy, , Digital Frontier Press, Lexington, Mass; Dator, J., From tsunamis to long waves and back (1999) Futures, 31 (1); Dator, J., Alternative futures for K-waves (2006) Kondratieff waves, warfare and world security, pp. 311-317. , IOS Press, Amsterdam, T.C.

Vermilion, the biggest producer in the area, undertook in 2012 a basinwide well-integrity risk-management project with the goal of understanding and minimizing the risk of freshwater-aquifer pollution. The Paris basin operations include 20 fields, for a total of 289 active wells, more than half of which were drilled in the 1980s. The objectives of the leakage risk assessment are twofold: First, identify high-risk scenarios and ""must act"" wells that require immediate intervention; second, adopt lean (i.e., eliminating waste) prevention and mitigation measures that satisfy the local regulator. The risk-assessment methodology is based on scenarios (i.e., ways in which the hazards, brines or hydrocarbons, can cause damage to targets, the freshwater aquifers). Each scenario involves the failure of a number of barriers with the function to prevent or mitigate damage. In this approach, evidence from in-depth failure analysis is used to build and calibrate scenarios, as well as to validate degradation mechanisms and understand their dynamics. Evidence considered is not limited to drilling reports and wireline logs, but includes all observations, measurements, and weak signals that one can use to test assumptions on the presence, absence, or aging of well integrity. Evidence-based scenarios are complemented by known failure mechanisms, thus reducing the risk of ""black swans,"" very improbable but catastrophic events, even though their probability is constrained by observed behavior during the 4,000 well years of operations in the basin. The criticality (product of probability and severity) of each applicable scenario is then computed by use of an exhaustive database of the characteristics of each well, resulting in a complete risk profile for the basin. The risk-assessment process revealed that casing corrosion caused by brine injection is the biggest driver of well-integrity risk; it also allowed tailoring effective prevention and mitigation actions: For instance, the criticality of scenarios is reduced to an acceptable level if the time between tubing failure and injection stop is kept to 3 months or less. Furthermore, the analysis helps define the role of periodic logging and thus reduce possible waste (i.e., actions that do not contribute to understanding, preventing, or mitigating risk). The evidence-based approach, since applied to another French basin, has proved effective for managing risk at the basin level, by cutting a middle way between universal checklists and the excessively narrow focus of well-by-well analysis: The former are too large and hazy and may hide real dangers among hardly applicable generalities, whereas the latter tends to be expensive and unsystematic and misses recurring patterns. Heavy-duty analytics and modeling are used most efficiently on focused and specific failure analyses to understand the dominant phenomena, which one can then use to paint a quantitative and consistent picture at the level of a field or basin.

What lies beneath the spate of recent RIS3s, in terms of specialization options as well as of the processes through which the latter were reached, is only now beginning to be examined in depth. Notably, the Commission did not offer a proper blueprint for RIS3-making, but opted instead to suggest a wide range of possible instruments. Based on our experience with the Romanian strategy-building process, in this article we outline a foresight-based toolkit for smart specialization and entrepreneurial discovery, though we too stop short of proposing a detailed full-fledged blueprint. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Data analytics; Delphi; Entrepreneurial discovery; Large-scale foresight; Smart specialization; Weak signals","Delphi analysis; entrepreneur; European Commission; strategic approach; Europe",,,,,"Aghion, P., David, P.A., Foray, D., Science, technology and innovation for economic growth: linking policy research and practice in ‘STIG Systems’ (2009) Research Policy, 38, pp. 681-693; Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Collins, H., Tacit and explicit knowledge (2010), University of Chicago Press Chicago; Day, G.S., Schoemaker, P.J.H., Scanning the periphery (2005) Harvard Business Review, 83, pp. 144-148; Dufva, M., Ahlqvist, T., Elements in the construction of future-orientation: a systems view of foresight (2015) Futures, 73, pp. 112-125; http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20-%20EN%20version.pdf, EC (European Commission), EUROPE 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, Brussels, 2010, accessed at; (2012), http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=e50397e3-f2b1-4086-8608-7b86e69e8553, EC (European Commission), Guide to Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS 3), May accessed at; Foray, D., The economic fundamentals of smart specialization (2013) Ekonomiaz, 83 (2), pp. 55-78; Foray, D., Smart specialization: opportunities and challenges for regional innovation policy (2015), Routledge London; Foray, D., Goenaga, X., The Goals of Smart Specialisation S3 Policy Brief Series, no. 1/2013.

Furthermore, we analyze whether internal experts (experts employed with firms) and external experts (e.g., consultants) differ in the importance they attribute to signals as predictors of technological discontinuities. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset obtained from a conjoint analysis conducted with 29 experts in the ICT industry. The conjoint approach allows for a simulation of the forecasting process and considers utility trade-offs. The results show that for both types of experts the perceived benefit of users most highly contributes to predicting technological discontinuities. Internal experts assign more importance to legal frameworks (e.g., standards) as signals helping them to predict technological discontinuities than external experts. The latter, in turn, assign more importance to profit margins and the recombination potential of technologies than their internal counterparts. Our results add important insights to the literature on R&D and innovation management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Existing approaches for identifying weak signals in strategic decision making use environmental scanning procedures based on standard filtering algorithms. These algorithms discard patterns with low information content; however, they are not able to discard patterns with low relevance to a given strategic problem. Idea mining is proposed as an algorithm that identifies relevant textual patterns from documents or websites to solve a given (strategic) problem. Thus, it enables to estimate patterns' relevance to the given strategic problem. The provided new methodology that combines weak signal analysis and idea mining is in contrast to existing methodologies. In a case study, a web-based scanning procedure is implemented to identify textual internet data in the field of self-sufficient energy supply. Idea mining is applied for filtering and weak signals are identified based on the proposed approach. The proposed approach is compared to a further - already evaluated - approach processed without using idea mining. The results show that idea mining filtering improves quality of weak signal analysis. This supports decision makers by providing early and suggestive signals of potentially emerging trends, even with only little expressive strength. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Idea mining; Strategic decision making;

Weak signals, also conceptualised as trends, can be considered the most relevant input for developing foresight in an organisation. While detecting weak signals has traditionally relied on the news media, cultural products such as literature, movies, art, or computer games appear to have been neglected in the practice of foresight.However, literary genres such as novels can be a valuable source for developing foresight. Literature can be characterised as delivering ""thick descriptions"". Not only do novels describe social practices, but from them the reader also gains, for instance, deep insights into the feelings and emotions of the characters.These thick descriptions are even more interesting in the context of foresight when one considers that these descriptions play a role in the construction of social reality and therefore can influence, over time, reality, or rather translate fiction into fact. It can be argued that the new departs from cultural products, before translating into widely accepted social practices or mass-market products. The value of using literature in foresight also appears to be related to the notion that these narratives can be read as scenarios, revealing the potential of literature. Because of their narrative structure, these scenarios can overcome cognitive barriers in the development of foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cultural products; Foresight; Narratives; Trends","Computer games; Signal detection; Cultural products; Foresight; Market products; Narrative structures; Narratives; Social practices; Social reality; Trends; Translation (languages); conceptual framework; culture; organizational framework; trend analysis",,,,,"Liebl, F., Schwarz, J.O., Normality of the future: trend diagnosis for strategic foresight (2010) Futures, 42 (4), pp. 313-327; Liebl, F., The anatomy of complex societal problems and its implications for OR (2002) J.

Yet in retrospect it is often predictable. Extant literature mainly focuses upon the psychological traps which may impede decision-makers' ability to recognise weak signals. Although this perspective is important, it is partial, as organisations are often culpable too. This mainly theoretical and conceptual paper suggests that the counter-measures organisations take to guard against risk and danger may be more symbol than substance, upholding comforting views of the world that are severely at odds with reality. Implications of a symbolic perspective for theory, practice, policy and research are discussed. © 2015 The Braybrooke Press Ltd.",,,,,,,"Abolafia, M.Y., Kilduff, M., Enacting market crisis: the social construction of a speculative bubble (1988) Administrative Science Quarterly, 33, pp. 177-193; Allison, G., Zelikow, P., Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis (1999), New York: Longman; Barley, S.R., Semiotics and the study of occupational and organizational cultures (1983) Administrative Science Quarterly, 28 (3), pp. 393-413; Bazerman M.Watkins, M., (2008) Predictable Surprises, The Disasters You Should Have Seen Coming and How to Prevent Them, , Boston: Harvard Business School Press; (1991), pp. 9-16. , London: FT Business Information Ltd; Report of the Inquiry into the Circumstances of the Collapse of Barings (1995), London: HMSO; Brown, A.D., Politics, symbolic action and myth making in pursuit of legitimacy (1994) Organization Studies, 15 (6), pp. 861-878; Brown, R.H., (1977) A Poetic for Sociology, , Cambridge: Cambridge University; Brown, R.H., Bureaucracy as praxis: toward a political phenomenology of organizations (1978) Administrative Science Quarterly, 23 (3), pp. 365-382; Brown, R.H., (1989) Social Science as Civic Discourse, , Chicago: Chicago University; Brown, R.H., Rhetoric, textuality, and the postmodern turn in sociological theory (1991) Sociological Theory, 8 (2), pp. 188-197; Chikudate, N., If human errors are assumed as crimes in a safety culture: a life world analysis of a rail crash (2009) Human Relations, 62 (9), pp. 1267-1287; Clarke, L., Perrow, C., Prosaic organizational failure (1996) American Behavioral Scientist, 39 (8), pp. 1040-1056; Collinson, D.L., ""Surviving the Rigs"" Safety and surveillance on North Sea oil installations (1999) Organization Studies, 20 (4), pp. 579-600; Dandridge, T.C., Mitroff, I., Joyce, W.F., Organizational symbolism: a topic to expand organizational analysis Academy of Management Review, 5 (1), pp. 77-82; Dandridge, T.C., 'Symbols' function and use' (1983), pp. 69-80. , L.

Mindfulness–mindlessness theory warns us that routine practices based on low levels of exploration and exploitation may hinder performance. Finally, the theory of learning failure distinguishes between the traps of failure or overexploration and the traps of success or overexploitation. Combining and advancing these insights, we offer a typology of incompetence traps: (a) underexploration–underexploitation or mindlessness, (b) overexploration–underexploitation, and (c) overexploitation–underexploration. We examine their manifestations in perception, cognition, and action. Based on our analysis of how incompetence traps may hamper learning in management education, we give examples of how instructors may help students achieve synergistic exploration–exploitation via informed vision (combining depth and multiple perspectives); perceptive thinking (combining theoretical, constraint-savvy knowledge and practical, context-savvy knowledge); and mindful action (developing and refining new and existing capabilities). © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","incompetence traps; informed vision; mindful action; mindfulness; mindlessness; overexploitation; overexploration; perceptive thinking; sensemaking",,,,,,"Baron, R.M., Misovich, S.J., On the relationship between social and cognitive modes of organization (1999) Dual-process theories in social psychology, pp. 586-605. , Chaiken S., Trope Y., (eds), New York, NY: Guilford,,.

While companies are compelled to manage exploration projects, the processes underlying the expansion of knowledge in these projects are not well known. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the literature, this paper first presents a conceptual view of the notion of expert. Then, the research question is analyzed by means of a case study of a polar expedition. The project leader seeks a knowledgeable person who has never been identified as an expert, but whose knowledge is essential. Findings – The expert appears both in his cognitive and social dimensions. Moreover, he emerges out of the situation, on the basis of neither strong nor weak signals. The rationality of expert solicitation falls within a pragmatic logic where the acquired knowledge must reduce the uncertainty so that the project can progress. The learning process enables to increase gradually the knowledge of the actor but also to build the legitimacy required in order to have access to the expert. Practical implications – Findings can be translated in more general situations. Indeed, polar expeditions projects and exploratory innovation projects (Garel and Lièvre, 2010) possess some common characteristics: lack of knowledge concerning, timing issues, need to implement a pragmatic, enquiry-based learning. These projects strongly rely on external expert knowledge. This case study suggests that, while it may be useful, planning should not strictly define the course of action. A central competence of the project leader is to manage the duality between planning and adaptation. This implies the ability to adapt, to detect and to assess human resources and knowledge flows rapidly, as well as to weave social links inside and outside the organisation. Originality/value – The existing literature offers a comprehensive view of experts in an organisation. However, the questions of expert selection and identification remain open. This paper fills a gap in the literature concerning the way experts are identified and selected. The case study shows that identifying experts does not solely depend on weak signals (reputation) or on strong signals (the expert’s social status). Rather, the expert emerges in the situation, in an unexpected way. The expert’s social dimension is not sufficient and one must look to the cognitive roots of the expertise. On the other hand, the fact is emphasised that the expert is a social construct which emerges from the solicitation process. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Experts; Knowledge; Learning; Project management; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Amin, A., Cohendet, P., (2004) Architectures of Knowledge, Firms, Communities and Competencies, , andOxford University Press, Oxford:; Ancori, B., Expertise et citoyenneté: les Grecs anciens et nous (2009) Revue d’anthropologie des connaissances, 3 (1), pp. 485-529. , , Vol.No., pp; Belleval, C., Deniaud, I., Lerch, C., A model for the management of design project issues: the case of the microsatellites design (2010) International Journal of Design and Innovation Research, 5 (1). , and, Vol.No; Ben Mahmoud-Jouini, S., Charue-Duboc, F., Enhancing discontinuous innovation through knowledge combination: the case of an exploratory unit within an established automotive firm (2008) Creativity and Innovation Management, 17 (2), pp. 127-135. , and, Vol.No., pp; Bootz, J.P., Schenk, E., Comment gérer les experts au sein et en dehors des communautés?

An important aspect within the innovation process, is technology planning. The Heinz Nixdorf Institute developed a technology planning concept, which is supported by an Innovation-Database. The Innovation-Database synchronizes aspects from the market pull and the technology push. Furthermore, it is used as a knowledge management system for innovations and technologies. The challenge is filling the technology pool with a minimum set of technologies in order to use the whole functionality of the Innovation-Database. Many resources are needed in order to fill the technology pool or to update it. There is in increase in information in the World Wide Web and most of the information is fuzzy. Our approach is to identify them automatically by using crawler technologies. Therefore a software tool was developed, which automatically crawls for technologies in the database of the European Patent Office and in the journal database IEEE Xplore. In these data sources, the tool identifies technologies automatically in natural texts, prepares the data and visualize them. It is not suitable to scan a text for a defined set of technologies in a dictionary, because then the tool is not able to find new technologies or to detect weak signals. In this paper, the architecture and features of the software tool is described. It uses text mining methods to detect technologies in unstructured, fuzzy data. As input data, the user has to provide a search field, which the search is performed for. Furthermore, the data sources have to be defined. The tool crawls these data sources in order to identify technologies, which can be relevant for a given search field. The tool suggests newly identified technologies for the search field, which are generally relevant. The user has to decide whether those technologies are important for him. This information is used as feedback for the text-mining model to improve the precision of future analyses. In order to support the user, a suggested technology is automatically provided with further information, like a description and an estimation of technological maturity. With this information a user can start an evaluation of the technology. For every technology a datasheet is created with detail information. It can easily be customized for specific demands. All technologies can be visualized on a radar. The radar shows all technologies for a search field according to its relevance. These information is used for strategic product and technology planning.

Local C/A code coherent matrix is generated based on the prior information, which can speed up the acquisition. Influence of navigation data hopping is effectively reduced with the parity data. In order to reduce the amount of fast Fourier transform (FFT) calculations dramatically, the navigation data is accumulated before coherent integration. The improved half-bit weak signal acquisition algorithm improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduces the amount of acquisition computations. The experimental results show that the algorithm can acquire indoor weak signal (SNR = -44 dB) in a short time with high sensitivity, which is suitable for the GPS software receiver. © 2014 WIT Press.","Coherent accumulation; GPS receiver; Incoherent accumulation; Prior information; Weak signal acquisition","Coherent accumulation; GPS receivers; Incoherent accumulation; Prior information; Weak signals; Algorithms; Fast Fourier transforms; Information technology; Signal analysis; Signal receivers; Global positioning system",,,,,"Ziedan, N.I., (2006) GNSS Receivers For Weak Signals, , ARTECH HOUSE; Li, Y.-Y., Xu, X.-S., Liu, X.-X., Acquisition algorithm based on halfbit alternation and FFT combination for weak signals of GPS software receiver (2012) Journal of Chinese Inertial Technology, 20 (1), pp. 46-50. , in Chinese; Li, S., Yi, Q.-M., Chen, Q., Weak signal acquisition method for GPS software receiver (2012) Journal of Computer Applications, 32 (3), pp. 816-818+822. , in Chinese; Jiang, B.-X., Zhang, Z.-Z., Meng, W.-X., Whole bit acquisition algorithm in software GPS receiver in weak signal environment (2008) Journal of Electronic Technique Application, 9, pp. 99-102. , in Chinese","Department of Electronic Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China",,"WIT Transactions on Information and Communication Technologies",,"WIT Transactions on Information and Communication Technologies","7 May 2013 through 8 May 2013","Wuhan",100915,17433517,9781845648282,,,"English","WIT Trans.

Since such a setting enhances creativity and perception, it has been identified as a means to develop new products, services, and business models. Novelty starts with weak signals of change within an environment and leads to innovations. From a constructivist perspective, in which knowledge needs to be processed or ""constructed"", weak signals of change are not perceived by the outside environment. Rather, they have to be conceptualized in a cognitive process. We use this theoretical perspective to illustrate the value of novels in identifying and cognitively conceptualizing weak signals. With the support of sense-making theory, we illustrate how novels contribute to comprehending novelty in two frames of reference: by broadening the perspective, enhancing the creativity, and increasing the sensitivity of managers/corporate decision makers to detect weak signals; and by ensuring that the customer comprehends the link of an SF prototype to a future product or service. Our theoretical considerations are illustrated by an example from the novel, Super Sad True Love Story, in which the SF prototype is part of a broader fictional story. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Frames of reference; Novels; Science fiction prototyping; Sense-making; Trend; Weak signals","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Frames of reference; Novels; Science fictions; Sensemaking; Trend; Weak signals; Decision theory; cognition; decision making; innovation; research; science and technology; trend analysis",,,,,"Harris, S.D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals: detecting the next big thing (2002) Futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-28; Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

These firms that were once quality leaders can no longer compete on the quality of their products or services. This research develops a theoretical understanding of how organizations can sustain a quality advantage. It offers a conceptual definition of sustaining a quality advantage which involves not only sustaining a high level of quality performance, but also sustaining a high consistency of quality performance. A comparative case study provides evidence of three capabilities that distinguish firms with different levels of sustaining quality. These capabilities include: (1) meta-learning, (2) sensing weak signals, and (3) resilience to quality disruptions. The case analysis argues that meta-learning helps sustain a high level of quality performance, while sensing weak signals and resilience improves the consistency of quality performance. This study offers a dynamic capability-based strategy that explains how to sustain a competitive advantage in quality, which may also have implications for sustaining other operational competitive advantages. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach – An example of mapping and identifying expectations is presented as a result of a thematic analysis of qualitative interview data, collected from six stakeholder groups of the media industry. Findings – Expectation types and gaps can be identified through the use of systematic expectation mapping, conceptualized in this paper as “expectation management.” Expectation management analyzes expectation types and priorities, and it assists in crafting response strategies. Four types of expectations (must, will, should, and could) were identified in an empirical study of the media industry. Research limitations/implications – As the empirical study focussed on one industry in one country, the findings should be considered an introduction to expectation mapping and expectation management, to be further developed in other settings. Practical implications – Organizations can gain strategic advantages by using expectation management to deepen communication management. New skills and processes may be needed to enable communication professionals to analyze and understand the core level of expectations. Social implications – Expectation management can help organizations respond to current societal pressures and help publics voice their concerns toward organizations. Originality/value – A new concept with strategic value is presented. The reported study of mapping and identifying expectations helps to clarity and interpret factors that shape stakeholder relationships and satisfaction on a deeper level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Expectation management; Expectations; Public relations theory; Weak signals",,,,,,"Boulding, W., Kalra, A., Staelin, R., Zeithaml, V.A., A dynamic process model of service quality: From expectations to behavioral intentions (1993) Journal of Marketing Research, 30 (1), pp. 7-27; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Brønn, P.S., Adapting the PZB service quality model to reputation risk analysis and the implications for CSR communication (2012) Journal of Communication Management, 16 (1), pp. 77-91; Burgoon, J.K., Interpersonal expectations, expectancy violations, and emotional communication (1993) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 12 (1-2), pp. 30-48; Chung, J.Y., Examining the legitimacy gap in issues management applying expectancy violation theory (2009) Proceedings of the 12th annual International Public Relations Research Conference, pp. 101-119. , Yamamura, K.

Building on signaling theory, we develop and test a model of the incentive and sorting effects of pay secrecy - a pay communication policy that limits employees' access to pay-related information and discourages the discussion of pay issues - under varying pay-for-performance (PFP) system characteristics. Results of a multiround laboratory simulation largely support the proposed moderated-mediation model. They indicate that pay secrecy has an adverse impact on individual task performance that is mediated by PFP perceptions, amplified when pay determination criteria are relative (as opposed to absolute), and attenuated when performance assessment is objective (as opposed to subjective). Results also indicate that pay secrecy has a similar adverse effect on participant continuation intentions (mediated through PFP perceptions, amplified when pay determination criteria are relative, and attenuated when performance assessment is objective), particularly among high performers. These findings suggest that weak signals associated with a particular managerial practice may become salient when interpreted in the context of other practice-based signals and that, under such conditions, even weak signals may drive negative-oriented inferences, having important behavioral implications. © Academy of Management Journal.",,,,,,,"Adams, J.S., Inequity in social exchange (1965) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 2, pp. 267-299. , L.

Here, we consider instead informal and unobservable networks. The paper explores how hidden informal exchanges can impact upon organisational decision-making and performance, particularly around inter-agency working, as knowledge distributed across organisations and shared between organisations is often shared through informal means and not captured effectively through the formal decision-making processes. Early warnings and weak signals about potential risks and crises are therefore often missed. We consider the implications of these dynamics in terms of crisis avoidance and crisis management. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","control; crisis; informal networks; organisational performance; risk",,,,,,"Ackroyd, S., Thompson, P., (1999) Organizational Misbehaviour, , London, SAGE; Argyris, C., (1990) Overcoming Organizational Defences.

In case when a strong signal is moving the number of measurements may be insufficient to get such high SNR for another weak signal. We propose a method how to overcome this difficulty using a number of short sequences of measurements with low SNR. The idea is similar to that used in Kohonen artificial neural networks. It is applied in combination with a method of minimization of residual power based on a multidimensional optimization. A number of examples show an efficiency of the whole approach. © 2014 WIT Press.","Antenna array signal processing; Neural networks; Optimization","Antenna arrays; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Optimization; Signal processing; Array signal processing; Array signals; High signal-to-noise ratio; Multidimensional optimization; Residual power; Short sequences; Strong signal; Superresolution methods; Signal to noise ratio",,,,,"Stoica, P., Li, J., Tan, X., On spatial power spectrum and signal estimation using the Pisarenko framework (2008) IEEE Transactions On Signal Processing, 56 (10), pp. 5109-5119; Lopez-Dekker, P., Mallorqui, J.J., Capon- and APES-based SAR processing: Performance and practical considerations (2010) IEEE Transactions On Geoscince and Remote Sensing, 48 (5), pp. 2388-2402; Ferreol, A., Larzabal, P., Viberg, M., On the resolution probability of MUSIC in presence of modeling errors (2008) IEEE Transactions On Signal Processing, 56 (5), pp. 1945-1953; Kidera, S., Sakamoto, T., Sato, T., Super-resolution UWB radar imaging algorithm based on extended Capon with signal optimization (2010) IEEE Transactions On Antennas and Propagation, 20 (5), pp. 100-109; Richmond, C.D., Mean-squared error threshold SNR prediction of maximum-likelihood signal parameter estimation with estimated colored noise covariances (2006) IEEE Transactions On Information Theory, 52 (5), pp. 2146-2164; Capon, J., High-resolution frequency-wavenumber spectrum analysis (1959) Proceedings of IEEE, 57 (8), pp. 1408-1418; Schmidt, R.O., (1981) A Signal Subspace Approach to Multiple Emitter Location and Spectral Estimation, , Ph.

To solve this problem, a new method based on the theory of signal reconstruction for EEG feature extraction is proposed. In the proposed method one-dimensional (1D) EEG is mapped to two-dimensional (2D) EEG. The fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and discrete cosine transformation (DCT) were used for 2D EEG processing and feature extraction. Four feature values were suggested in this paper: magFFT (magnitude of energy value of 2D signal processed by FFT), magDCT (magnitude of energy value of 2D signal processed by DCT), magFFTnor (magnitude of energy value of normalized 2D signal processed by FFT), and magDCTnor (magnitude of energy value of normalized 2D signal processed by DCT). The proposed method was performed by LabWindows/CVI. Epileptic EEG as example signal was analyzed and the rapid detection of preictal was implemented, with 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Results show that the proposed method could amplify the characteristics of weak EEG signal rapidly and efficiently, and solve the difficulty in extraction of the hidden feature. © 2014 WIT Press.","Feature extraction; Signal reconstruction; Two-dimensional EEG","Signal reconstruction; Discrete cosine transforms; Electroencephalography; Extraction; Fast Fourier transforms; Feature extraction; Image coding; Processing; Signal analysis; Signal processing; EEG signals; Discrete cosine transformation; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Epileptic EEG; Fast fourier transformation (FFT); Feature values; Processing method; Rapid detection; Two Dimensional (2 D); Feature extraction; Biomedical signal processing",,,,,"Millán, J.R., Mourino, J., Asynchronous BCI and local neural classifiers: An overview of the adaptive brain interface project (2003) IEEE Trans on Neural System and Rehabilitation Engineering, 11 (2), pp. 159-161; Tong, L.L., Wang, W., Zhao, N., Huang, X.N., The method evaluation for preictal prediction of epilepsy with strong-noise EEG and simulation of automatic drug release system (2010) 2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics, 3, pp. 1054-1058; Wang, X.W., Wang, L., Miao, G.J., Lu, Y.B., Han, D., Wan, H.J., Zhao, Y., An approach for compressive sampling and reconstruction of transient and short-time power quality disturbance signals (2012) Power System Technology, 36 (3), pp. 191-196","Li, F.N.; School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou UniversityChina","Lorenz P.","Advanced Scientific and Industrial Research Center (ASIRC);WIT Transactions on Information and Communication Technologies","WITPress","2014 International Conference on Communication Technology and Application, CTA 2014","19 August 2014 through 20 August 2014",,108847,17433517,9781845649302,,,"English","WIT Trans.

Due to the high dynamic or weak signal situation occur from time to time under certain conditions, vector receiver technology is proposed, it makes full use of the correlation of each satellite channel, and better solve the problem. However, as the connection between vector receiver channels is too close, once the positioning result goes wrong, it will make all the channels affected. Aiming at the problem, this paper put forward the real-time monitoring of the signal-to-noise ratio, elevation of each visible satellite, removing the satellites not suitable for application, and use fuzzy satellites selection method to choose a combination with the minimum Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) among the rest satellites, thus to ensure high positioning precision and efficiency. Compared with the classical optimal satellites selection method, this method has the advantages of a smaller amount of calculation, a faster calculation speed, and so on. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is effective to avoid the negative effects between vector receiver channels and have high efficiency in the selection of the best combination among visible satellites. © 2014 WIT Press.","Elevation; GDOP; GPS receiver; Positioning precision and efficiency; Satellites selection method; Signal-to-noise ratio","Efficiency; Satellites; Signal receivers; Signal to noise ratio; Vectors; Elevation; GDOP; GPS receivers; Positioning precision; Selection methods; Global positioning system",,,,,"Pany, T., Eissfeller, B., Use of a vector delay lock loop receiver for GNSS signal power analysis in bad signal conditions (2006) Position, Location, and Navigation Symposium, pp. 893-903; Lashley, M., Bevly, D.M., Analysis of discriminator based vector tracking algorithms (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 National Technical Meeting of the Institute of Navigation, pp. 570-576; Lashley, M., Bevly, D.M., What are vector tracking loops and what are their benefits and drawbacks (2006) GNSS Solution Column, pp. 44-53; Lashley, M., Bevly, D.M., Hung, J.Y., Performance analysis of vector tracking algorithms for weak GPS signals in high dynamics (2009) Selected Topics In Signal Processing, pp. 667-673; Benson, D., Interference benefits of a vector delay lock loop(VDLL)GPS receiver (2007) Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Institute of Navigation, pp. 749-756; Wang, B., Wang, S.T., An Improved Satellite Selection Method in Attitude Determination Using Global Positioning System (GPS) (2009) Recent Patents On Space Technology, 1, pp. 6-11; Mosavi, M.R., Applying genetic algorithm to fast and precise selection of GPS satellites (2011) Asian Journal of Applied Sciences, 4, pp. 229-237; Wei, M.M., Wang, J., An Improved Satellite Selection Algorithm GPS Satellites ICSP2012 Proceedings; Wei, M.M., Wang, J., A New Satellite Selection Algorithm for Real-time Application (2012) International Conference On Systems and Informatics (ICSAI2012); Zhang, M.Y., Zhang, J., A fast satellite selection algorithm: Beyond four satellites (2009) IEEE Journal of Selected Topics In Signal Processing, p. 3; Xie, G., (2009) Principles of GPS and Receiver Design, , Publishing House of Electronics Industry, Beijing; Cong, L., Tan, Z.Z., Satellite selection algorithm to improve precision and real-time performance of GPS positioning (2008) System Engineering and Electronics, 10, pp. 1914-1917",,,"WIT Transactions on Information and Communication Technologies","WITPress","2013 International Conference on Information Engineering, ICIE 2013","1 November 2013 through 2 November 2013","Hong Kong",105910,17433517,9781845648558,,,"English","WIT Trans.

The eventuality of an incident or an accident may markedly be reduced if the risks connected to it are efficiently diagnosed. With the aid of this outlook, flight safety has witnessed decades of successful improvement.

In particular, risks associated with global supply chains are special since they involve a multitude of international stakeholders with different perspectives on security needs and measures. Therefore, it is essential to determine which techniques and instruments are best suited for risk assessment in complex and multi-organizational environments. The Delphi expert survey technique has proven to be a valuable instrument for long-term decision making support as well as foresight, and has a potential value for risk assessment. We contribute to this research strand and conduct a Delphi-based risk analysis. Our research concentrates on man-made risks in global supply chains which are particularly uncertain in terms of type, location, and affected supply chain partners and can therefore be classified as inherently ""wicked"" issues, i.e. issues that are multidimensional with often unpleasant outcomes. We illustrate that Delphi research makes a fivefold contribution to risk analysis by: (1) identifying and quantifying risks; (2) analyzing stakeholder perceptions and worldviews; (3) stimulating a global communication process; (4) identifying weak signals, outlier opinions, and wildcards; (5) and facilitating risk scenario development. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Risk; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks","Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks; Communication; Research; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Supply chains; Risk analysis; decision making; Delphi analysis; future prospect; perception; risk assessment; stakeholder; terrorism",,,,,"Thun, J.-H., Hoenig, D., An empirical analysis of supply chain risk management in the German automotive industry (2011) Int.

We first review the literature on strategic foresight, innovation management and strategic management in order to identify the potential value contributions. We use survey data from 77 large multinational firms to assess how much value is generated from formalized strategic foresight practices in these firms. We show that it is possible to capture value through (1) an enhanced capacity to perceive change, (2) an enhanced capacity to interpret and respond to change, (3) influencing other actors, (4) and through an enhanced capacity for organizational learning. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Organizational future orientation; Strategic foresight; Value creation; Weak signals","Innovation management; Multinational firms; Organizational future orientations; Organizational learning; Strategic foresight; Strategic management; Value creation; Weak signals; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Industry; empirical analysis; innovation; multinational enterprise; organizational change; strategic approach; technological development",,,,,"Schwarz, J.O., (2006) The Future of Futures Studies: A Delphi Study with a German Perspective, Shaker, Aachen; Schwarz, J.O., Assessing the future of futures studies in management (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 237-246; Daheim, C., Uerz, G., Corporate foresight in Europe: ready for the next step?

By combining the capabilities of tech-mining in identifying and in highlighting trends, weak signals, with those of semantic-TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadatch - Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) in identifying the functions, its causes and effects, a better understanding of the trends may be obtained in a shorter time. An interesting trend in the use of graphene in cathode materials, as well as its applications, mainly to enhance the conductivity and the discharge and recharge of the Li-air battery, has been quickly assessed as a result of the combined techniques. Another two cases, the increased presence of nanostructures in cathodes and the emergence of LIFePO4 in the lithium-ion batteries have been also analysed in a short time. The results may predict the good possibilities of the combination of these two evolving techniques. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","lithium-air battery; semantic-TRIZ; tech-mining; technology analysis","data mining; energy; prediction; research and development; technological development; trend analysis",,,,,"Adams, J., Pendlebury, D., (2011) Global research report: Materials science and technology.

Experiences from a foresight project exploring future innovation patterns (www.innovation-futures.org) are discussed. Four specific features were applied in order to underpin the recognition of structural transformation:.Inductive foresight approach with an emphasis on capturing indications for extra-systemic change at a micro level instead of extrapolating seemingly dominant macro-trends. Visual inspiration, to mobilise tacit knowledge, support a creative spirit and an easy exchange of ideas among people with different disciplinary backgrounds. Rigorous assessment of coverage of dimensions of change, to foster the explicit consideration of possibly unrecognised/hidden structural changes. Extended openness for diversity, to avoid the exclusive interpretation of weak signals only in the context of the existing structures. The findings of the project indicate interesting changes in the nexus of innovation demand and innovation supply. A wide variety of hybrid value creation models with novel configurations of innovation actors emerged. We explain the approach and findings of the project and discuss in particular the implications for foresight methodology.

While the relevance of dealing with trends is constantly underlined, the effects of labeling phenomena as trends and megatrends in an organizational context have not been widely discussed. In particular, the dangers of dealing with megatrend semantics are that the strategic implications of these phenomena are unclear and that an organization is likely to increase its blind spots, thereby actually undermining its foresight capability.This paper applies a discourse-theoretical perspective developed by Ernesto Laclau and Chantalle Mouffe to trend management in organizations. It argues that megatrends can be perceived as empty signifiers, as they provide an overdetermined, abstract form of meaning that addresses discourses but cannot convey concrete meaning for management. It is proposed that instead of concentrating on megatrends (empty signifiers), trend management should reconstruct those elements of a discourse in which shifts of meaning can be observed, detecting and understanding the nodal points of a discourse. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Discourse theory; Empty signifier; Megatrends; Nodal points; Trends","detection method; management; organizational framework; strategic approach; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic response in turbulent environments (1982) Working Paper no 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision-making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21, pp. 307-320; Martinet, A.-C., Strategic planning, strategic management, strategic foresight: the seminal work of H.

Many futurists are developing foresight of future technologies based on Delphi studies, unfolding history, brainstorming, expert surveys, trend analysis, data mining, and so on. However, formalizing these processes is still a necessary task. In this paper, we introduce the NEST (New and Emerging Signals of Trends) model developed by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI). The NEST collects information from worldwide expert networks and detects the weak signals of emerging future trends systematically, based on massive data analysis, inference techniques, and Delphi studies, to support the development of foresight of future research and technology. The NEST model combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. In the quantitative approach stages, NEST uses clustering, pattern recognition, and cross-impact analysis using a Bayesian network. In the stages of qualitative approaches, NEST conducts environmental scanning, brainstorming, and a Delphi study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bayesian network; Delphi study; Emerging trend; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative analysis; Weak signal","Bayesian analysis; decision making; Delphi analysis; detection method; future prospect; model; quantitative analysis; research and development; science and technology; technology adoption; trend analysis; Korea",,,,,"Zhang, D., Extracting social and community intelligence from digital footprints: an emerging research area (2010) UIC'10 Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, , Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, Xi'an, China; Chen, W., Social network analysis supporting collaborative knowledge building (2009) SOCINFO '09 Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Social Informatics, , IEEE Computer Society; Zhuhadar, L., Visual knowledge representation of conceptual semantic networks (2010) Social Network Anal.

Activities of the studied companies are strongly determined by changes in the external economic situation. The specific features of the analyzed enterprises need to be responded by early reactions to the economic changes. The appropriate identification and interpretation of weak signals can be an important element for supporting the effective functioning of enterprises, both in the economic development and in the recession. Therefore, the authors proposed the implementation of selected early warning elements in the information system supporting knowledge management in machine-building industry enterprises. The system developed within the research project is financed from public science funds of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland.","Early warning system; Knowledge management system","Construction industry; Information systems; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management information systems; Management science; Early Warning System; Economic development; Effective Functioning; Engineering enterprise; Identification and Interpretation; Knowledge management system; Machine building industry; Supporting knowledge; Information management",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issue management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Chau, P.Y.K., On the use of construct reliability in mis research: A meta-analysis (1999) Information & Management, 35, pp. 217-227; Dohn, K., Gumiński, A., Zoleński, W., Assumptions for the creation of a system for supporting knowledge management in an enterprise of mechanical engineering industry (2011) Management Information Systems in XIII Business Intelligence and Knowledge, pp. 19-27. , WULS Press Warsaw; Klausmann, W., Betriebliche frühwarnsysteme im wandel (1983) Zeitschrift für Organisation, 52, pp. 39-45; Senge, P.M., (1992) The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization, , London; Huaiyi, Z., Dongchuan, S., Xiaoping, S., A design of a crisis early warning system for core ability strategy (2002) Science of Science and Management of Science and Technology, (8); Zoleński, W., Early warning systems in the enterprise (2005) Scientific Papers of Silesian University of Technology, Pp Organization and Management, (27). , Gliwice","Dohn, K.; Silesian University of TechnologyPoland","Sassman R.Lehaney B.","","Operational Research Society","Knowledge and Information Management Conference: Sustainable Quality, KIM 2013","4 June 2013 through 5 June 2013",,108585,,0903440539,,,"English","Proc. - KIM, Knowl.

However BI constructed by integrating data from multiple sources remain restricted to strong economic signals as its systems cannot cope with the amount and diversity of data about sustainability. BI's non-engagement with weak signals about the impact of unsustainable activities is aggravated by the absence of a single uncontested definition of sustainability. Ecosystem literature advocates grappling with sustainability's characteristic uncertainty-complexity by providing stakeholders with information that fosters capacities for social learning. Here we put forward socially constructed risk-based analytical-deliberative platform that integrates weak environmental signals, thus better representing the uncertainty and complexity aspects of sustainability. An Australian case-study of irrigators is used to examine how our platform integrates weak environmental signals with BI's strong signals, and fosters capacities for social learning among decision-makers. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Business intelligence; Information management; Integrated risk; Social learning; Sustainability; Systems",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E., (1990) Implanting Strategic Management, , 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, NY; Beal, R.M., Competing effectively: Environmental scanning, competitive strategy, and organisational performance in small manufacturing firms (2000) Journal of Small Business Management, 38 (1), pp. 27-47; Beck, U., Risk society (1993) Towards A New Modernity, , Trans.

In doing so the paper looks at new generations of ideas; new generations of individualism; and new generations of organisational structures and cultures. Weak signals can already be identified from a century ago indicating new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, psychology and education. These signs of what many regard as evolutionary change in human thinking run parallel with many of the exponential changes manifesting in the external world. The paper argues for a shift beyond egotistic individualism to collective individualism, laying foundations for major organisational transformation to meet the needs of uncertain futures. The paper suggests that futures studies as a field needs to be sensitive to the developmental and paradigmatic changes that have been occurring both within and across the knowledge spectrum. Finally, the World Futures Studies Federation is examined as a case study to determine whether it is, indeed, ahead of its times. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"culture; education; future prospect; individualism; philosophy; psychology; twenty first century",,,,,"Berger, G., (1964) Phénoménologie du temps et prospective, , Presses Universitaires de France, Paris; Adam, B., Groves, C., (2007) Future Matters: Action, Knowledge, Ethics, Supplements to the Study of Time, , Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands; Inayatullah, S., Gidley, J., (2000) The University in Transformation: Global Perspectives on the Futures of the University, , Bergin and Garvey, Westport, CT; Boulding, E., Image and action in peace building (1988) Journal of Social Issues, 44 (2), p. 17; Masini, E., The future of futures studies (1989) Futures, (APRIL), p. 152; Inayatullah, S., Wildman, P., (1998) Futures Studies: Methods, Emerging Issues and Civilizational Visions.

By providing the participants with fabricated exogenous strong and weak information signals, the paper is able to examine the effect of the signals on their responses. The purpose of this paper is to find evidence suggesting that gender, moral opposition, level of susceptibility to information, and information signal strength influence herding in business professionals. Design/methodology/approach-The paper adopts the Hirshleifer and Hong Teoh (2003) definition of herding as “any behavior similarity/dissimilarity brought about by the interaction of individuals."" In the controlled environment of a professional business seminar, the paper collects data on the willingness of participants to strategically default on a mortgage that is underwater by varying degrees. By providing the participants with fabricated exogenous strong and weak information signals, the paper is able to examine the effect of the signals on their responses. Findings-The major contribution is that the paper finds evidence suggesting that signal strength does indeed matter. The paper finds that a weak signal is more likely to produce herding when respondents answer questions relating their own decisions and strong signals produce more herding when respondents provide advice to others. The paper also finds that women are less likely to herd and people who report they are susceptible to information influences are more likely to herd. Not surprisingly, participants who are morally opposed to strategic default are less likely to herd in most scenarios. Originality/value-No other study of which the authors are aware looks specifically at signal strength in a financial setting or uses a sample of business professionals to examine herding of a financial nature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Herding; Information signal strength; Strategic mortgage default",,,,,,"Alevy, J.E., Haigh, M.S., List, J.A., Information cascades: Evidence from a field experiment with financial market professionals (2007) The Journal of Finance, 62 (1), pp. 151-180; Barber, B.M., Odean, T., Boys will be boys: Gender, overconfidence, and common stock investment (2001) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116 (1), pp. 261-292; Bikhchandani, S., Sharma, S., Herd behavior in financial markets (2001) IMF Staff Papers, 47 (3), pp. 279-310; Cipriani, M., Guarino, A., Herd behavior in a laboratory financial market (2005) American Economic Review, 95 (5), pp. 1427-1443; Fernández, B., Garcia-Merino, T., Mayoral, R., Santos, V., Vallelado, E., Herding, information uncertainty and investors’ cognitive profile (2011) Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 3 (1), pp. 7-33; (2011) Predicting strategic default, , FICO White Paper No. 50, San Jose, CA; Froot, K.A., Scharfstein, D.S., Stein, J.C., Herd on the street: Informational inefficiencies in a market with short-term speculation (1992) The Journal of Finance, 47 (4), pp. 1461-1484; Gneezy, U., Kapteyn, A., Potters, J., Evaluation periods and asset prices in a market experiment (2003) Journal of Finance, 58 (2), pp. 821-838; Guiso, L., Sapienza, P., Zingales, L., The determinants of attitudes towards strategic default on mortgages (2013) The Journal of Finance, 68 (4), pp. 1473-C1515; Hirshleifer, D., Hong Teoh, S., Herd behaviour and cascading in capital markets: A review and synthesis (2003) European Financial Management, 9 (1), pp. 25-66; Hirshleifer, D., Subrahmanyam, A., Titman, S., Security analysis and trading patterns when some investors receive information before others (1994) Journal of Finance, 49 (5), pp. 1665-1698; Jain, A.K., Pinson, C., The effect of order of presentation of similarity judgments on multidimensional scaling results: An empirical examination (1976) Journal of Marketing Research, 13 (4), pp. 435-439; Jegadeesh, N., Kim, W., Do analysts herd?

The need to improve foresight and strengthen the dialogue between foresight, planning, and innovation processes in SMEs is noted. This paper examines what enhances and what hinders the absorption of foresight knowledge in the innovation processes in SMEs. Based on the empirical data gathered by participative observation in 3 workshops and 8 expert interviews, the lack of weak signals or foresight tools are not disincentives. Instead, inherent human features of SMEs seemed to be the main barriers to foreseeing and innovation in Finnish SMEs. © 2012 IEEE.","Foreseeing; Innovation; SMEs","Business environments; Empirical data; Finnish; Foreseeing; Innovation in SMEs; Innovation process; SMEs; Weak signals; Industrial management; Innovation; Industry",,,,,"Atherton, A., Hannon, P., (1995) Thinking about Strategic Awareness Capability, , Small Business centre, Durham University Business School; Melkas, H., Harmaakorpi, V., (2012) Practice-based Innovation: Insights, Applications and Policy Implications.

Users located at macrocell edge experience relatively weaker signals from their serving Base Station (BS) and greater levels of interference from neighboring BSs. Therefore QoS provisions for such users are much harder to achieve. We propose and discuss some strategies which involve open access femtocell deployment to aid the macrocell edge users in achieving their performance objectives. These femtocells can be deployed in various configurations near the macrocell edge. The macrocell edge users can then communicate through the nearby femtocell. We also discuss the situation when BS and femtocell cooperatively communicate with the macrocell edge user. We investigate the performance of these deployment strategies through simulations. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Cellular network; Deployment strategy; Femtocells; Macro cells; Open Access; Performance objective; Quality of service; Femtocell",,,,,"Fodor, G., Koutsimanis, C., Racz, A., Reider, N., Simonsson, A., Muller, W., Intercell Interference Coordination in OFDMA Networks and in the 3GPP Long Term Evolution System (2009) Journal of Communications, 4 (7), pp. 445-453. , Aug. 2009; Andrews, J.G., Interference Cancellation for Cellular Systems: A Contemporary Overview (2005) IEEE Wireless Communications, 12 (2), pp. 19-29. , April; Rappaport, T.S., (2002) Wireless Communications Principles and Practice, , Prentice Hall; (2010) Overview of 3GPP Release 8, , V0.1.1 06; Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Gatherer, A., Femtocell networks: A survey (2008) IEEE Communications Magazine, 46 (9), pp. 59-67. , Sep; Boccuzzi, J., Ruggiero Femtocells, M., (2011) Design and Application, , McGraw- Hill Publication; Zhang, J., Roche, G., (2010) Femtocells: Technologies, , John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., Publication; Ali-Yahiya, T., LTE and Femtocell (2011) Understanding LTE and Its Performance, (PART 2), pp. 127-143. , Chapter 8; Jo, H., Xia, P., Andrews, J.G., Open, Closed and Shared Access Femtocells in the Downlink, , arXiv:1009.3522v1; Guvenc, I., Jeong, M., Watanabe, F., Inamura, H., A Hybrid Frequency Assignment for Femtocells and Coverage Area Analysis for Co-Channel Operation (2008) IEEE Communication Letters, 12 (12), pp. 880-882. , Dec; Claussen, H., Performance of Macro- and Co-Channel Femtocells in a Hierarchical Cell Structure (2007) Proc.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the practical and theoretical knowledge about EWS by providing empirical evidence from companies located in three diff erent European countries, i.e. Croatia, Austria and Greece. We propose that companies in richer countries, as measured in terms of GDP, have a higher implementation level of EWS and are more likely to meet current state-of-the-art EWS standards while companies in the countries with a lower GDP show a lesser level of development. Moreover, we explore the reasons for not implementing EWS. For our survey we used a structured questionnaire. Contrary to our hypotheses, there are no signifi cant diff erences among the countries concerning the level of EWS implementation. However, there are some diff erences as to the kind of EWS. Overall, EWS are predominately short-term oriented and operating in all three countries. The main reasons for not implementing EWS are the shortage of employees and the lack of management initiatives.","Early warning system; Empirical evidence; Operating and strategic business behavior; Trends in management",,,,,,"Aguilar, F., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York, NY; Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E.J., (1990) Implementing Strategic Management, , Prentice Hall, New York, NY; Ansoff, H.I., Managing Surprise and Discontinuity - Strategic Response to Weak Signals (1976) ZfbF, 28, pp. 129-152; Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I., (1979) Strategic Management, , Macmillan, London; Barry, D., Elmes, M., Strategy Retold: Toward a narrative View of Strategic Discourse (1997) Academy of Management Review, 22 (2), pp. 429-452; Bickhoff, N., Blatz, M., Eilenberger, G., Haghani, S., Krause, K.-J., (2004) Die Unternehmenskrise Als Chance.

Design/methodology/approach: Built upon the concept of the systemic foresight methodology, the Scan-4-Light approach involves the integrated use of horizon scanning, network analysis and evolutionary scenarios combined with expert consultations and workshops. The study identified the emerging trends, issues, weak signals and wild cards; created high-value visualisations to emphasize the results and findings; and produced narratives to increase the impact and awareness of the development issues. Findings: The Scan-4-Light project has resulted in a large number of specific outputs, providing the views of the Searchlight newsletters' contents at various levels of granularity. It has set out to show how the tools used here can be applied to illustrate the relationships among issues, and how these vary across countries and regions over time, and are linked to various stakeholders and possible solutions to problems. Research limitations/implications: Scan-4-Light demonstrates how foresight tools and techniques can be used for the analysis of complex and uncertain issues, such as development and poverty, in a systemic way. Practical implications: The Scan-4-Light approach can be applied in a number of areas for scanning and identifying emerging trends and issues, and understanding the relationships between systems and solutions. Social implications: The paper gives evidence that most of the issues, if not all, related to development are not isolated, but interlinked and interconnected. They require more holistic understanding and intervention with an effective collaboration between stakeholders. Originality/value: A demonstration of a novel scanning approach is presented in the paper. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Development; Forward planning; Horizon scanning; Network analysis; Poverty; Project evaluation; Scenarios; Searchlight",,,,,,"Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., Freeman, L.C., (2002) Ucinet VI for Windows: Software for Social Network Analysis, , Analytic Technologies, Harvard, MA; Ena, O., Mikova, N., Saritas, O., Sokolova, A., A technology trend monitoring methodology: The case of semantic technologies (2012) Technovation, , submitted for publication; Freeman, L.C., Centrality in social networks I: Conceptual clarification (1979) Social Networks, 1, pp. 215-239; Intellecap, Development initiative - rainwater harvesting (2010) Searchlight South Asia - Monthly Newsletter on Trends in Pro-poor Urban Development in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, , Intellecap, New Delhi; Miles, I., Saritas, O., The depth of the horizon: Searching, scanning and widening horizons (2012) Foresight, 14 (6), pp. 530-545; (2008) Millennium Project 2008 State of the Future, , Millennium Project, Washington, DC; (2012), www.millennium-project.org/millennium/challeng.html, available at; Nugroho, Y., Saritas, O., Incorporating network perspectives in foresight: A methodological proposal (2009) Foresight, 11 (6), pp. 530-545; Saritas, O., Systems thinking for foresight (2006), PhD thesis, Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, The University of Manchester, Manchester; Saritas, O., Systemic foresight methodology (2012) Designing and Implementing Future Oriented STI Policy - Potentials and Limits of Foresight Studies, , in Gokhberg, L., Meissner, D. and Sokolov, A.(Eds.), Springer, Berlin; Saritas, O., Miles, I., (2012) Scan-4-Light: A Horizon Scanning/Trend Monitoring Project for the Rockefeller Foundation, , Manchester Institute of Innovation Research; Saritas, O., Nugroho, Y., Mapping issues and envisaging futures: An evolutionary scenario approach (2012) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 79, pp. 509-529; Saritas, O., Smith, J., The big picture - trends, drivers, wild cards, discontinuities and weak signals (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 292-312; Saritas, O., Pace, L.M., Stalpers, S., Stakeholder participation and dialogue in foresight (2010) Exploring the Future: The Role of Interaction in Foresight, pp. 38-71. , in Borch, K., Koutsopoulos, K.

Design/methodology/approach - The main method applied is critical thinking combined with a review of selected aspects of complexity theory and a general experience of applying foresight. Several new and practical implications for foresight techniques and their application are derived. Promoting variation is examined as one way to make policies more resilient in a complex system. Findings - Complexity science demonstrates that disruptive events do not need an associated trigger, as they are a normal part of a complex system. This insight implies that if we are always looking for weak signals we will certainly be caught unawares. Practical implications - The assumption that disruptive events can be managed by planning and forecasting is not a workable option. Instead, policy making needs to assume that unexpected disruptive events will happen even with the best horizon scanning system in place. Foresight techniques need to be developed to embrace emergence and to provide capabilities such as reframing to visualise systems from very different perspectives, including those considered impossible now. Originality/value - Although neither complexity theory nor the concept of reframing is new in the area of foresight, the derivation of practical implications for foresight techniques is original. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complexity; Complexity theory; Disruptive events; Emergence; Policy making; Reframing; Strategic planning; Uncertainty management; Variation",,,,,,"Axelrod, R., (1985) The Evolution of Cooperation, , Basic Books, New York, NY, reprinted ed; Axelrod, R., Cohen, M., (2001) Harnessing Complexity: Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier, , The Free Press, New York, NY; Battram, A., (2000) Navigating Complexity: The Essential Guide to Complexity Theory in Business and Management, , Spiro Press, London; Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, Volume 1: Human Science for a New Era, , Transaction Publishers, Piscataway, NJ; Bhimji, W., (2009) Guidance on the Use of Strategic Foresight Analysis for Policy Development in Government, , www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/horizon-scanning-centre/futuresinpolicyguidance.pdf, available at (accessed 6 June 2012), UK Government Office for Science, London; Byrne, D., (1998) Complexity Theory and the Social Sciences: An Introduction, , Routledge, New York, NY; Gheorghiou, L., Cassingena Harper, J., Keenan, M., Miles, I., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, pp. 3-23. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Glouberman, S., Zimmerman, B., (2002) Complicated and Complex Systems: What Would Successful Reform of Medicare Look Like?, , Commission on the Future of Healthcare in Canada, Ottawa; Goodwin, B., (1994) How the Leopard Changed Its Spots, , Phoenix, London; Inayatullah, S., Deconstructing and reconstructing the future: Predictive, cultural and critical epistemologies (1990) Futures, 22 (2), pp. 115-141; Mendonça, S., Pine Cunha, M., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 201-218; Mikulecky, C., The emergence of complexity: Science coming of age or science growing old?

We argue that recent futures studies have essentially deepened the analysis of this concept, which originally lacked an accurate definition. Placing weak signals in the general context of futures research has provided the concept with a theoretical point of attachment and linked it with other futures concepts - such as strong signals and trends. Recent studies have also increased the applicability of the concept of weak signals, specifying ways in which signals can be identified, collected and interpreted. Consequently, a number of empirical examples of the analysis of weak signals are nowadays available. In the present paper, we summarize and evaluate both theoretical contributions and managerial implications of these new approaches. While emphasizing the advancements of research, we also want to point out that Ansoff not only was a pioneer in the field, but developed many ideas that are still applicable today. We conclude our paper by suggesting directions for the further development of weak signals research. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"conceptual framework; research; signal",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Californian Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice-Hall International, London; Ansoff, H.I., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes-new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22, pp. 93-111; Coates, J.S., Boom time in forecasting (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 62, pp. 37-40; Irvine, J., Martin, B.R., (1989) Research Foresight.

The response proposed here is that many of the developments identified by efforts to detect and interpret weak signals are the result of designed interventions that define the repertoire of actions and frames. Very often, as Ansoff argued, actors use a variety of models and filters for seeking and using weak signals. Thus weak signals are not only dependent on the interpretative equipment applied by actors, but from a constructivist perspective the identification of and meaning given to weak signals are strongly influenced by design choices made at the outset. In this sense design is a constitutive element of both the environment and signal detection/use. An example of how design is constitutive of both context and understanding can be found in the history of hospital hygiene. This case study illustrates how dominant regimes of practice, established through the conception of pathogen bacteria and antibacterial treatments and disinfection, are now creating signals that call into question fundamental design of hygiene practices. By examining the epistemic assumptions of scientific disciplines and the designed repertoire of practical responses it becomes clear how contexts and frames of interpretation are constituted and how such contexts and frames then define what is recognised as a weak signal. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"design method; disinfection; environmental response; hospital sector; hygiene; modeling; planning method; signal",,,,,"Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Goffman, E., (1974) Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience, , Harper and Row; Bruno, B., (1988) The Pasteurization of France, , Belknap Press; Jørgensen, M.S., Lindegaard, H., Hygiene in a Historical Perspective (2007) Hygiejne i et historisk perspektiv, , Institut for Produktion og Ledelse, DTU; Latour, B., Woolgar, S., (1988) Laboratory Life - The Construction of Scientific Facts, , Princeton University Press; Weick, K.E., (1996) Sensemaking in Organizations, , Sage Publications; Simon, H., (1969) The Sciences of the Artificial, , MIT Press; Cross, N., (2007) Designerly Ways of Knowing, , Springer; Ministry of Science, Technology and Development (2004) Teknologisk fremsyn om hygiejne - Forkningspolitisk handlingsplan; Smith, L.H., Kristensen, J.E., Light, Fresh Air and Cleanliness - Birth of the Modern Social Hygiene (1986) Lys, luft og renlighed - Den moderne social-hygiejnes fødsel, , Akademisk Forlag; Semmelweis, I., Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers , 3, p. 2008. , 1861, republished as: The Etiology, Concept, and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever, Social Medicine; Boyce, J.M., Pittet, D., Guidelines for hand hygiene in health-care setting: recommendations for the healthcare infection control practices and advisory committee and hand hygiene task force (2002) Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 23 (12), pp. S3-S41; Latour, B., (1987) Science in Action - How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society, , Harward University Press; Pinch, T., Oudshorn, N., (2007) How Users Matter, , MIT Press; Bijker, W.E., (2002) Of Bicycles, Bakelites and Bulbs - Toward a Theory of Sociotechnical Change, , MIT Press; (1996) Making Technology Our Own?

The following theories and associated theoretical frameworks are discussed in the article: (1) Environmental Scanning Model, (2) Nonaka's Knowledge Management Theory, (3) Gammelgaard's and Ritter's Knowledge Retrieval Matrix, (4) Boisot's Information Space Model and (5) Vejlgaard's Diamond Shaped Trend Model. These various and nevertheless complementary perspectives are important for the further development of weak signal analysis, knowledge management theory and knowledge management practices in modern organisations as well as for anticipation and decision-making in policy-making arenas. There are still many theoretical and empirical challenges in these fields of scientific knowledge. A general conclusion is that all these frameworks provide interesting new perspectives for modern futures studies as such. Another conclusion is that there are various knowledge management (KM) and scanning frameworks available for implementing weak signal analysis. However, this paper, its observations and conclusions also imply that a more generalised approach to weak signal analysis needs to be developed and that modern KM theories should be used when developing new futures studies/foresight methodologies. According to the theoretical guidelines presented in this article, it is possible to make the suggestion that it would be wise to integrate the latest developments in weak signal analysis into knowledge management theory and vice versa. © 2011.",,"decision making; knowledge; management; policy making; signal processing; theoretical study",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic Response in Turbulent Environments (1982), Working Paper No. 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, August; Ansoff, I.H., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, p. 510. , Prentice/Hall International; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Webb, J.R., An evaluation of Igor Ansoff's theory of weak signal management by means of an investigation and forecast of future developments in the ophthalmic laser environment (1987), Doctoral thesis, University of Strathclyde; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part I: Introduction (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrintro.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part II: Information Theory (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/infotheory.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part IV: Evolution and Growth of the Weak Signal to Maturity (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrmatur.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Part V: A Process Model for Weak Signal Research (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrprocm.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Presentation in Actes de la 3e Conferénce de l'AIS Amérique (Association for Information Systems); Harris, D.D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals: detecting the next big thing (2002) The Futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-29; Day, G., Schoemaker, P., Scanning the periphery (2005) Harvard Business Review, pp. 135-148. , November; Mendonça, S.S., e Cunha, M.P., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., Wild cards, weak signals and organizational improvisation (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 201-218; Mannermaa, M., Toolbox ja heikot signaalit (1999) Futura, 13 (2), pp. 32-37; Mannermaa, M., A Strong Future from Weak Signals (2004) Heikoista signaaleista vahva tulevaisuus, , WSOY, Porvoo; Hiltunen, E., Heikot signaalit - teoriakatsaus (2000) Futura, 14 (2), pp. 72-77; Hiltunen, E., Heikkojen signaalien käyttö yrityksissä (2001) Futura, 15 (1), pp. 45-50; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Kuusi, O., Hiltunen, E., Linturi, H., Heikot tulevaisuussignaalit - Delfoi tutkimus (2000) Futura, 14 (2), pp. 78-92; Nikander, I.O., Early warnings - a phenomenon in project management (2002), Dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Science in Technology, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Moijanen, M., Heikot signaalit tulevaisuuden tutkimuksessa (2003) Futura, 17 (4), pp. 38-60; Ilmola, L., Kuusi, O., Filters of weak signals hinder foresight: monitoring weak signals efficiently in corporate decision-making (2006) Futures, 38 (8), pp. 908-924; Uskali, T., Paying attention to weak signals - the key concept for innovation journalism (2005) Innovation Journalism, 2 (4), pp. 33-49; Brummer, V., Innovaatioaihioiden verkkopohjainen ideointi ja monikriteerinen seulonta (Internet based generation and multicriteria screening of innovation ideas) (2005), http://www.sal.hut.fi/Publications/pdffiles/TBRU05.pdf, MSc Thesis (Engineering), Department of Physics and Mathematics, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Kuosa, T., Heikko signaali vai merkityksetön kohina: Pattern management - ontologisesti uusi lähestymistapa heikkojen signaalien tarkasteluun ja tulkintaan (2005) Futura, 19 (4), pp. 115-120; e Cunha, M.P., Chia, R., Using teams to avoid peripheral blindness (2007) Long Range Planning, 40 (6), pp. 559-573; Kuosa, T., Futures signals sense-making framework (FSSF): a start-up tool to analyse and categorise weak signals, wild cards, drivers, trends and other types of information (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 42-48; Mendonca, S., Cunha, M.P.E., Ruff, F., Kaivo-oja, J., Venturing into the wilderness: preparing for wild cards in the civil aircraft and asset-management industries.

Weak signals are signs anticipating or pointing to possibly emerging new issues. Weak signals can be perceived through all five human senses: they can be seen, heard, smelled, felt or even tasted. Visual weak signals are weak signals shown in a visual form. They can be represented as images: photos, paintings, drawings, video clips, etc. [2]. The method used by the Futures Window is to display weak signals in a visual form as a slide show on a large screen with the aim of encouraging people to anticipate and innovate futures. The Futures Window could be a central tool to be used in Creative Foresight Spaces (CFS). 11The idea for the concept of Creative Foresight Space originated during two research projects ""Technology Futures Forum"" and ""SOMED"" (Social media at the crossroads of physical, virtual and digital worlds), initiated by Dr. Sirkka Heinonen, and first described in the conference presentation by Toni Ahlqvist, Minna Halonen and Sirkka Heinonen ""Social Media Applications for Innovative Working Environments"" 9th International Conference of Finland Futures Research Centre and Finland Futures Academy ""Culture and Innovation - The search for Creative Power in Economics and Societies"". Session on Social Media and Technology I. 6-8 June 2007, Turku, Finland.

The concept of CFS is offered as one way of responding to the growing demand for innovation in corporations and work organisations. The FW method was tested at VTT Technical Research Centre (http://www.vtt.fi/) in Finland in two pilots in 2006-2007. A survey was conducted to gather employee's opinions of the FW experiments. The results show that employees considered the FW positively and they confirmed that it stimulated futures thinking. The results of this study are encouraging for further developing the Futures Window as a key element of CFS. This article will present the concept of Creative Foresight Spaces in detail together with its possible applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"future prospect; innovation; mass media; prediction; signal",,,,,"Hiltunen, E., The Futures Window - A Medium for Presenting Visual Weak Signals to Trigger Employees' Futures Thinking in Organizations (2007), HSE Publications, working paper-w-423, Helsinki; Hiltunen, E., Weak Signals in Organizational Futures Learning (2010), HSE Publications, Thesis, A-365, Helsinki; Heinonen, S., Ruotsalainen, J., Anticipation and interpretation of black swans as a learning process.

As a form of foresight raw material, ""weak signals"" can be thought of as gross, unstructured, fragmented, incomplete and inadvertent environmental data that may be refined into valuable information regarding context and further be articulated into strategically actionable knowledge. As advanced indicators that precede significant discrete one-off events and/or novel developments in the rate and direction of trends, their analysis has the potential to facilitate the real-time alignment between organisational decision-making and changing external circumstances. These predictors of future change pose fundamental problems of identification and interpretation and represent a challenge to established mental models. Thus, the practical significance of weak signals is that they can be transformed into meaningful insight for policy action. Such a value, however, does not materialise automatically. Realising this potential requires a degree of tolerance and fluidity of the collective cognitive frameworks by which weak signals can be apprehended, assessed and acted upon. This paper aims at covering the scope of perceptions and actions typically involved in the tracing and tracking of this shaping process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"cognition; data interpretation; decision making; modeling; perception; prediction; signal processing",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Californian Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice-Hall International Inc., USA; Diamond, J., (2004) Collapse, , Penguin, New York; Diamond, J., (2004) Twilight at Easter, , www.nybooks.com, New York Review of Books, available at; Lakatos, I., (1978) The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Philosophical Papers, 1. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Tegamar, M., Many lives in many worlds (2007) Nature, 448 (5), pp. 23-24; Kuhn, T.S., (1970) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, , Chicago University Press, Chicago; Castells, M., Information technology and global capitalism (2000) Living in Global Capitalism, pp. 52-74. , On the Edge, Jonathan Cape, London, W.

While providing a broad view and discussing a variety of contributions on this topic, the aim of this article is to offer a more constructivist approach to early detection studies than has been typically the case so far. The article starts by positioning the underlying problem of weak signals within the broader field of futures studies. The second section examines the Ansoffian tradition, first on the basis of Ansoff's own contributions, then through key enhancements offered by scholars working in the same perspective. The third section develops the arguments for a constructivist critique of the Ansoffian tradition as a way to renew and enrich scientific debate. The fourth and final section presents the main open issues where research, case studies, methods and applications still need to make significant progress in the vast domain of weak signal analysis and early detection.""

Secondly, the move to transcend disciplinary specialisation, via inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary approaches is strengthening. Thirdly, at a higher order theoretical level, these developments are explicitly theorized in the discourses associated with postformal reasoning, integral theory and planetary consciousness. In spite of all these developments in other disciplines and knowledge fields, the institution of mass public education, with its underpinning industrial worldview, has been pretty static since its inception two hundred years ago. Finally, the paper identifies three minor, but significant, waves of evolutionary emergence in education over the last hundred years that if articulated and nurtured could strengthen the development of evolutionary pedagogies for the 21st century. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolution of consciousness; Evolutionary pedagogies; Foresight; Futures studies; Integral; Planetary; Postformal; Postformal pedagogies","education; theoretical study",,,,,"Gidley, J., Inayatullah, S., (2002) Youth Futures: Comparative Research and Transformative Visions, , Praeger, Westport, CT; Gidley, J., Bateman, D., Smith, C., (2004) Futures in Education: Principles, Practice and Potential, , Australian Foresight Institute, Melbourne; Freire, P., (1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, , Herder and Herder, New York; Illich, I., (1975) Deschooling Society, , Calder and Boyers, London; Gidley, J., Beyond homogenisation of global education: do alternative pedagogies such as Steiner education have anything to offer an emergent globalis/ing world?

The projects resulted in the evaluation of current methods for obtaining and processing scanning data and new conceptual thinking that may bridge the gap between scanning activities and policy-making. This paper provides an overview of conceptual thinking in two projects, SESTI and FAR Horizon. The key thinking is about emerging issues and aboutimaginative or potential wild cards, both considered to be potential storylines for future development or events that require policy action. Storylines come close to the concept of future narratives, as used in the policy discourse regarding aging in the Netherl and s. The shows that narratives are used by policymakers when they fit a particular strategy, but that the narratives must compete with both present-day (experienced ""past reality"") and future stories in policy discourse. The author describes strong ""future"" narratives and gives special attention those that include imaginative wild cards. The communicative strength of a future narrative (and the included issue) is decisive for its uptake in the discourse (in policy and business communities). However, this strength is only partly connected to its scientific or factual evidence base, since it may contain many elements that are not rational to make it strong. The paper is concerned with what makes a ""strong"" narrative. Next to the authority of the messenger and the interests of the receiver, its psychological and emotional appeal to the audience and its historical context make it persuasive. Examplesare given to show that future narratives are used to influence policy debates and decision making. Some have even succeeded in shaping the future to the interest of the author or for the benefit of society. The argument is that strong imaginative wild cards under the right conditions can have a powerful shaping effect, sometimes as shaping as that of real wild cards on the future.","Early warning; Emerging issues; Horizon scanning; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Chilton, P.A., (2004) Analyzing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice, , London: Routledge; Friedemann, F., Pre-earthquake signals: Underlying physical processes (2011) Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, , (in print); Georghiou, L., Cassingena Harper, J., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Hiltunen, E., Good sources of weak signals: Global study of where futurists look for weak signals (2008) Journal of Futures Studies, 12 (4), pp. 21-42; Loveridge, D., (2009) Foresight: The Art and Science of Anticipating the Future, , New York: Routledge; Markley, O., Staying resilient in a wild-card world (2011) Journal of the Institute of Noetic Science, (6); Morrison, J.L., Environmental scanning (1992) A Primer for New Institutional Researchers, pp. 86-99. , (eds.

It is in this grey area that ""social multinationals"" can be placed and examined. Scattered evidence is provided to illustrate the emergence of this relatively new phenomenon. Findings: There are weak signals that the ""social multinational"" is a viable institutional innovation. The economic rationale is mainly represented by what could be defined in Smithian terms as the ""selfless component of self-interest"", combined with the ex ante and ex post advantages associated to multinationality. Institutional and technological transformations have created opportunities for the emergence of this phenomenon over the past three decades. However, there is a need for specifically designed policies to reinforce this relatively new trend in international business. Originality/value: The paper proposes a new analytical category and draws insights on its potential implications for welfare, poverty reduction and economic development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cooperatives; Multinational companies; Non-governmental organizations; Social business; Social responsibility; Spillovers",,,,,,"Aldashev, G., Verdier, T., When NGOs go global: Competition on international markets for development donations (2009) Journal of International Economics, 79 (2), pp. 198-210; Andreoni, J., Payne, A., Do government grants to private charities crowd out giving or fund-raising?

Foresight has made a transition from thematic papers and policy briefs to a complex set of methods integrated in the framework of S&T and innovation policy making. Foresight also addresses broad social and economic issues along with conventional S&T problems. It focuses often on interdisciplinary fields and cross-sector problems. It has witnessed the introduction of such new methods as weak signals and wild cards, and it has benefitted from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Russian S&T foresight follows global trends. It has given support for revisions of the national S&T priorities and critical technologies. In 2007-2010, two cycles of the National S&T Foresight (initiated by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation) were completed. They resulted in the creation of frameworks and expert networks for future studies. Foresight culture has been finding deeper roots in Russia. The paper addresses mainly the key features of the third (ongoing) cycle of the national S&T Foresight (2011) against the background of the first two cycles and the international trends. This cycle represents a wider coverage of issues (macroeconomic scenarios, trends in basic research, S&T resources, future dem and for skills, and global drivers of S&T developments); more complicated methodologies (bibliometric analysis, expert panels, surveys, roadmapping, and quantitative models); and a combination of ""market pull"" and ""technology push"" approaches toward estimating future developments. This cycle is building a wider network of experts at new Foresight centres at various Russian research universities. It concludes with a discussion of some barriers still to be overcome in Foresight studies: integration of sectoral visions, deeper analyses of some scientific disciplines, stronger integration into policy making, and spreading among business and research communities.","Critical technologies; Decision-making; Foresight; Long-term forecasting; National innovation system; Roadmapping; Russian long-term S&T foresight; S&T priorities",,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Grand challenges - A new framework for foresight evaluation (2011) Paper Presented at the EU-SPRI Conference, , 20-22 September.

Innovative companies are aware of weak signals coming from the periphery and of trends in their industry, and they monitor the coherence between weak signals and trends (the external perspective) and strategic direction (the internal perspective).The literature today does not provide well-framed and complete methodologies for assessing the coherence among trends, vision and products. Therefore, the authors propose a methodology called ""the methodology of future coverage"", which measures how much the strategy oriented to the future effectively covers trends and megatrends. In other words, it helps to check the contents and the coherence of the firm' vision and products and those of the trends that will have relevance for the future of the industry, and this process supplies firms with supplementary information on how to improve. The authors tested this methodology and exemplified its use via the Eurotech case study, employing longitudinal analysis. The methodology can be useful as a tool for diagnosing the coherence between trends and company strategy. Moreover, from a dynamic point of view, it can be used as a tool to check on the company's progress in following up on trends by adapting its strategy over time. Finally, the methodology can be also used as a tool for cross-comparison of the ""level of future orientation"" among companies in the same industry. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend","Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend; Industry; corporate strategy; field method; forecasting method; future prospect; innovation; strategic approach; trend analysis",,,,,"Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1994) Competing for the Future, , Harward Business School Press, Boston; Okun, A., (1981) Prices and Quantities: A Macroeconomic Analysis, , The Brooking Institution; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , The Free Press, New York; Ansoff, H.I., The emerging paradigm of strategic behaviour (1987) Strateg.

Outlines five ways that every executive can improve his or her information diet in order to filter out nuggets of insight from the ocean of information. Strategy is built by insights. If you want those building blocks to differ from those of your competitors, you need to design a unique information diet for yourself and as we all know, the mind once widened by a new perspective never regains its original proportions. Provides tangible strategies that busy executives can adopt to enhance their effectiveness in the workplace. The big challenge every executive faces today is how to navigate this steady stream of noise and weak signals not only to find new business opportunities but also to create a portrait of the future that they can lead others toward. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business management; Information media; Internet; Strategic management",,,,,,,"Lindkvist, M.; Trendspotter and Futurologist, Pattern Recognition AB, Stockholm, Sweden",,,,,,,,02580543,,,,"English","Strateg.

What are the shaping forces, or sources of change and what might be their impacts, particularly where these may create entirely new challenges and opportunities? Futures experts (attendees of the FTA 2008 Conference) were invited to state their opinions on these questions by considering the trends, drivers, wilds cards, discontinuities and weak signals likely to shape the future through the Big Picture Survey. The survey was launched 6 months prior to the Conference. More than 250 responses were submitted by the Conference date. The results collected were synthesised and presented back to the attendees in a plenary presentation by the authors. The current paper aims to clarify the concepts first by suggesting definitions and discussing the distinctions between them. The paper then presents the rationales of conducting the Big Picture Survey (BPS), presents its methodology and discusses the results of the survey in a greater extent. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"survey; twenty first century; Canada; United Kingdom",,,,,"van Rij V.

Odyssea, Station 5, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","In the domain of futures studies, the need to develop methods and concepts to identify risks or opportunities ""early enough"" has become an issue and almost a discrete sub-field with its own debates, specialties and schools of thought.Our examination of the literature in this domain shows that early detection, early warning or weak signal analysis, to mention just a few of the terms being used, tends to convey the idea that finding faint evidence of possible futures is actually rather easy. We, however, believe that it is far from being an off-the-shelf process for whoever wants to detect early signs of changes. At the very least it raises cost/benefit questions, and it may have some shortcomings which, if ignored, could substantially increase the vulnerability of an organization. Our goal in this paper is to explore ways of going beyond an overly optimistic approach and provide a basis for the pragmatic use of weak signals and similar notions in strategic management and policy-making processes.After browsing through the several approaches that propose methods for the ""early"" tackling of trends, uncertainties, risks or opportunities to come, we will focus on the approaches defined by 1) weak signals and 2) early warnings or equivalents for the analysis of possible futures. We will in particular examine how mainstream claims have been presented then improved in the last 25 years, as well as how some of the problems involved have been insufficiently addressed so far. We will then show how these problems (closely linked to how the early perception claims are configured - how they are framed and modeled but also made affordable and useful) can directly impact the performance and management style of the organizations and societal settings in which they are deployed. The concluding section will propose a pragmatic approach to the problems raised: paradigmatic weaknesses or forms of blindness. This precautionary principle should lead to a real option approach in terms of futures to be considered and evaluated, so as to enhance the chances of avoiding risks, as well as following up promising directions, radical innovations or, more generally, strategic decision-making processes in both the corporate and policy-making arenas. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Early detection; Early warning; Strategic intelligence; Strategic planning; Weak signal","Early detection; Early warning; Management style; Optimistic approach; Policy making; Possible futures; Precautionary principle; Radical innovation; Real Options; Strategic decisions; Strategic intelligence; Strategic management; Weak signals; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Innovation; Management science; Strategic planning; Uncertainty analysis; Signal detection; decision making; early warning system; forecasting method; future prospect; precautionary principle; risk assessment",,,,,"Lüken, M., Baisch, F., Decision support based on weak signals: overcoming the implementation gap of strategic early warning systems (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics 1998, Conference theme: Intelligent Systems for humans in a Cyberworld, , IEEE, Piscataway, NJ; Nikander, O., (2002), Early Warnings - A phenomenon in project management, PhD Dissertation, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Miller, K.D., Waller, H.G., Scenarios, real options and integrated risk management (2003) Long Range Plann., 35, pp. 93-107; Ilmola, L., Kotsalo-Mustonen, A., Filters of weak signals hinder foresight: monitoring weak signals efficiently for corporate decision-making (2004) 2nd International Conference on Organizational Foresight, , http://hosting.fountainpark.com/strategysignals/pdf/liite2.pdf, Strathclyde University, Glasgow; Fuller, T., de Smedt, P., From oracles to dialogue (2008) Third International Seminar on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis: Impacts and Implications for Policy and Decision-making, Sevilla, Oct. 16-17; Shannon, C., Weaver Warren, W., (1949) The Mathematical Theory of Computation, , University of Illinois Press, Urbana; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

Very often, it does not at first contact fit in with our conventional understanding, experience or any context we are used to. Hence, we may say that we are overwhelmed with constantly changing raw data, and strategic actors especially tend to be short of more rapid, up-to-date, valid and in-depth understanding of the transforming business landscape and social environment. Strategic intelligence is an emerging field of business consulting, which aims to undertake the task of revealing large, complex or complicated issues of transformation in a more understandable form. Pattern management, however, can be seen as one field or one approach of strategic intelligence. It is an approach that may, on one hand, be based more on empiric data and formal structures than other forms of strategic intelligence, but, on the other hand, it is a very heuristic approach to integrate quantitative data, reasoning and narratives. The main attempts of this article are, first, to show, what are in general the most commonly used ways of managing, finding, drawing, reasoning or anticipating patterns from our environment, and second, to locate how the concept of pattern can be understood in different ways. From the gathered knowledge, this article presents three main categories of reasoning patterns: empirical calculation (EC) is common especially in enterprise consulting. Theory proving with observations (TPO) is common especially in natural sciences, and real combining (RC) is common especially in qualitative research and in narrative. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Complexity; Data mining; Emergence; Pattern management; Reasoning; Sense making; Strategic intelligence; Weak signals","Complexity; Emergence; Pattern management; Reasoning; Sense making; Strategic intelligence; Weak signals; Data mining; Heuristic methods; Metadata; corporate strategy; data mining; empirical analysis; heuristics; information; management; theoretical study",,,,,"Russell, R.L., (2007) Sharpening Strategic Intelligence: Why the CIA Gets It Wrong and What Needs to Be Done to Get It Right, , Cambridge University Press; (2007) Managing Strategic Intelligence Techniques and Technologies, , Information Science Publishing, M.

The system would take content that is personal but not proprietary, and create new value from it by detecting larger, long-term patterns that individual users might not be aware of. It would create the means to better distribute credit for finding weak signals or emerging trends, and create new forms of professional credit for work that currently remains invisible. It would create goods that are useful to individual practitioners and the profession as a whole. Finally, it would serve as a foundation for collaborative research in a community of practice that is highly distributed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"detection method; future prospect; Internet; research work; software; trend analysis",,,,,"Botterhuis, L., van der Duin, P., de Ruijter, P., van Wijck, P., Monitoring the future: building an early warning system for the Dutch Ministry of Justice (2009) Futures, 41. , See for example, J.

Weak signals are identified from the early 20th century indicating the emergence of new knowledge patterns. These signals have strengthened in the last 40 years. The paper first identifies new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, religion and education. New knowledge patterns are then identified in discourses that traverse disciplinary boundaries through transdisciplinary approaches such as futures studies and planetary/global studies. The paper then discusses evolution of consciousness, identifying research that theorises new ways of thinking as being related to individual psychological development and/or socio-cultural evolution. Finally, evolutionary concepts are discussed that attempt to meta-cohere the new knowledge patterns via the terms postformal, integral and planetary. Notably, academic research on "" futures of thinking,"" "" evolution of consciousness"" and/or "" global mindset change"" has been, until now, largely ignored by mainstream academic discourse on evolution, consciousness and futures studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Adult developmental psychology; Evolution of consciousness; Futures; Integral; Macrohistory; Planetary; Postformal; Transdisciplinarity","academic research; evolution; future prospect; interdisciplinary approach; philosophy; psychology",,,,,"Miller, R., Making connections to the world: some thoughts on holistic curriculum [Electronic version] (2006) Encounter: Education for Meaning and Social Justice, 19 (3); Naisbitt, J., (2006) Mindset: Eleven Ways to Change the Way You See - and Create - The Future, , Collins Business, Harper Collins, New York, NY; László, E., (2006) The Chaos Point: The World at the Crossroads, , Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc., Charlottsville, VA; Gidley, J., An other view of integral futures: de/reconstructing the IF brand (2010) Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning and Futures Studies, 42 (2), pp. 125-133; Hampson, G., Integral futures and futures of integral: an analysis of Richard Slaughter's analysis of Causal Layered Analysis (2010) Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning and Futures Studies, 42 (2), pp. 134-148; Slaughter, R., Introduction: Integral futures methodologies (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 101-108; Hayward, P., Pathways to integral perspectives (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 109-119; Gidley, J., The evolution of consciousness as a planetary imperative: an integration of integral views (2007) Integral Review: A Transdisciplinary and Transcultural Journal for New Thought, Research and Praxis, 5, pp. 4-226; Commons, M.L., Richards, F.A., Organizing components into combination: how stage transition works (2002) Journal of Adult Development, 9 (3), pp. 159-177; Einstein, A., Relativity: The Special and General Theory (Translated Robert W.

Most textile companies are not used to managing extensive R&D projects. A strategic decision to launch a smart textile product can therefore be something of a challenge. Focus throughout the design process has been on meeting existing safety standards while providing an innovative solution which does not restrict physical movement and which provides a reliable alerting system that can withstand a minimum of 25 wash cycles.

Based on this segmentation, in a merchandising situation, one can interact with the customer to identify the segment to which the customer belongs and in turn offer the proper product and merchandising. Design/methodology/approach: The study deals with the creation of new hair products, using both ideation by brand Delphi™ and by experimental design of ideas with conjoint measurement (IdeaMap.Net). It ends with the creation of a merchandising product for hair coloring based on concept segmentation. First the internet was used to facilitate the acquisition and prioritization of new ideas. Then the experimental design of ideas was used to identify which perform well in the body of test concepts. Findings: Three segments were identified: Segment 1 (54 percent) wants easy to use, high technology, and reliable products. Segment 2 (25 percent) wants to give, and get information about themselves, with respect to hair coloring. Furthermore, they want to make information giving/getting a process, not simply a rapid 1-2-3 affair. Segment 3 (21 percent) wants results. They want information, primarily what the product will do for them, what it delivers. Research limitations/implications: The innovative research deals with the creation of ""new to the world"" product ideas and the segmentation of respondents into different groups, based on their mind-sets. Practical implications: The segmentation results provide the manufacturer and the trade with an opportunity to fine-tune the development of the new product and its merchandising. One of the recurring questions, however, is how to find these segments in the population? Data mining works by searching for assignment rules that put people into the segments based on a decision rule. The variables used by the decision rule come from external information about the respondent, which the respondent may have provided previously, or patterns of purchases that the individual may have made over time. The objective is to increase the chances of correctly classifying a new individual as a member of one of the three segments, and by so doing present the prospect with a better offer, whether an improved product or shopping experience. Originality/value: The study deals with the creation of new hair products, using both ideation by brand Delphi™ and by experimental design of ideas with conjoint measurement (IdeaMap.Net). This is a discussion towards high tech in merchandising haircoloring products. It examines new opportunities for development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Hair; Merchandising; Mindsets",,,,,,"Ben Rechav-Gabay, G., (2000) Relationship Selling and Trust, , UMI Press, Ann Arbor, MI; Box, G.E.P., Hunter, J., Hunter, S., (1978) Statistics for Experimenters, , John Wiley, New York, NY; Deutsche Telecom: The new millennium with a capital T (2000) Forbes, 81. , January 24; Flores, L., Moskowitz, H.R., Maier, A.S., (2003) From Weak Signals to Successful Product Development: Using Advanced Research Technology for Consumer-Driven Innovation, , ESOMAR, Technovate, Cannes; Green, P.E., Krieger, A.M., Segmenting markets with conjoint analysis (1991) Journal of Marketing, 55, pp. 20-31; Green, P.E., Srinivasan, V., A general approach to product design optimization via conjoint measurement (1980) Journal of Marketing, 45, pp. 17-37; Green, P.E., Krieger, A.M., Wind, Y., Thirty years of conjoint analysis: Reflections and prospects (2001) Interfaces, 31, pp. S56-S73; Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., Strategy as a stretch and leverage (1993) Harvard Business Review, 71 (2), pp. 75-84; Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1993) Competing for the Future, , Harvard Business School, Cambridge, MA; Hill, C.W., Jones, G.R., (2007) Strategic Management, , Houghton Mifflin Company, New York, NY; Jacobson, R., The Austrian school of strategy (1992) Academy of Management Review, 17, pp. 782-807; Jolson, M., Rossow, A., The Delphi process in marketing decision making (1971) Journal of Marketing Research, 8 (vember), pp. 443-448; Kanter, R.M., From spare change to real change: The social sector as Beta site for business innovation (1999) Harvard Business Review, 77 (3), pp. 122-132; Lumpkin, G.T., Dess, G.G., Clarifying the entrepreneurial construct and linking it to performance (1986) Academy of Management Review, 21, pp. 135-172; MacElroy, B., Variables influencing dropout rates in web-based surveys (2000) Quirks Marketing Research Review, , July/August; Mansfield, E., How economists see R&D (1981) Harvard Business Review, (November-December), pp. 98-106; Mone, M.A., McKinley, W., Barger III, V.L., Organizational decline and innovation: A contingency framework (1998) Academy of Management Review, 23, pp. 115-132; Moskowitz, H.R., (1984) Cosmetics Product Testing: A Modern Psychophysical Approach, , Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, NY; Moskowitz, H.R., Sensory segmentation of fragrance preferences (1986) Journal of the Society of Cosmetics Chemistry, 37, pp. 233-247; Moskowitz, H.R., (1995) Consumer Testing and Evaluation of Personal Care Products, , Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, NY; Moskowitz, H.R., Gofman, A., (2004), ""System and method for performing conjoint analysis"", US Patent Pending, US2005/0177398 A1, August 2005; Moskowitz, H.R., Gofman, A., (2007) Selling Blue Elephants: How to Make Great Products before Your Customers Even Know They Want Them, , Wharton School Publishing, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Moskowitz, H.R., Porretta, S., Silcher, M., (2005) Concept Research in Food Product Design and Development, , Blackwell Publishing, Ames, IA; Moskowitz, H.R., Gofman, A., Katz, R., Itty, B., Manchaiah, M., Ma, Z., Rapid, inexpensive, actionable concept generation and optimization - the use and promise of self-authoring conjoint analysis for the foodservice industry (2001) Foodservice Technology, 1, pp. 149-168; Nagamachi, M., Kansei as a powerful consumer-oriented technology for product development (2002) International Journal of Applied Industrial Ergonomics, 33, pp. 289-294; Pine, B., Gilmour, J.H., (1999) The Experience Economy, , Harvard Business School Press, Cambridge, MA; Porter, M.E., (1980) Competitive Strategy, , Free Press, New York, NY; Price, R., Technology and strategic advantage (1996) California Management Review, 23, pp. 115-132; Ray, R., Prediction markets and the financial 'wisdom of crowds' (2006) Journal of Behavioral Finance, 7, pp. 2-5; Reynolds, P.D., Hay, M., Camp, S.M., (1999), ""Global entrepreneurship monitor"", Executive report, Babson College, Babson Park, MA; Rudd, O.P., (2000) Data Mining Cookbook, , Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; Schumpeter, J., (1934) The Theory of Economic Development, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Seung-Joo, L., (2004), ""A case study of L'Oreal: innovation and growth strategy"", KDI School of Public Policy and Management, Dongdaemun-gu; Sharma, P., Chrisman, J.L., Toward a reconciliation of the definitional issues in the field of corporate entrepreneurship (1999) Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice, 23 (3), pp. 11-27; Stevens, G.A., Burley, J., Piloting the rocket of radical innovation (2003) Research Technology Management, 46, pp. 16-26; Systat, (1997) Systat: The System for Statistics.

Although trends are considered to be important drivers of environmental discontinuities which may lead to strategic surprises, there is no operationalization from a strategic point of view. In this paper we are going to conceptualize trends as (socio-cultural) innovations. This leads to important implications. If the nature of innovation is taken seriously, then strategic trend diagnosis has to deal with two different aspects, invention and diffusion. First, we are going to present a framework for identifying the invention aspect of a trend (i.e., "" the new"" ) which is based on the fact that "" the new"" results from a transgression of contextual boundaries. Second, we are going to operationalize the diffusion of "" the new"" as a threefold process of normalization - i.e., an unusual practice becomes social convention. Taken together, these two aspects provide a theoretical link between trends and market creation. In addition, by relating the above operationalizations to an entrepreneurial strategy-making framework, strategic issue diagnosis can be improved and more seamlessly linked to strategy formulation. © 2009.",,"conceptual framework; entrepreneur; future prospect; innovation; market development; organizational framework; planning theory; strategic approach; technology diffusion; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , The Macmillian Company, New York; Keegan, W.J., (1967), Scanning the International Business Environment, Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, Boston; Bright, J.R., Evaluating signals of technological change (1970) Harvard Business Review, 48, pp. 62-70; Bright, J.R., Forecasting by monitoring signals of technological change (1973) A Guide to Practical Technological Forecasting, pp. 238-256. , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, J.R.

Yet due to their inherent flexibility, open-market repurchase programs have long been criticized as weak signals lacking commitment. We evaluate whether some managers potentially use buyback announcements to mislead investors. We focus on cases where managers were seemingly under heavy pressure to boost stock prices and might have announced a repurchase only to convey a false signal. For suspect cases, the immediate market reaction to a buyback announcement does not differ from that generally observed. However over longer horizons, suspect firms do not enjoy the improvement in economic performance otherwise observed. Suspect firms repurchase less stock. Further, managers in suspect firms have comparatively higher exposure to stock options, a potentially endogenous result suggesting greater sensitivity to both stock valuation and to future equity dilution. Overall, the results suggest only a limited number of managers may have used buybacks in a misleading way as ""cheap talk."" Yet as theory also suggests, we find no long-run economic benefit to this behavior. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze why firms with average quality debt have not changed their tactics and consent to publishing their grade which would then differentiate an average quality debt from a riskier one. Design/methodology/approach: The paper estimates the mean values of ranks and the diagonal of the migration matrix on the basis of data on 1,639 bond rankings listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and publications by the largest Israeli rating agency, Maalot. Findings: From 1992 to 2004, one-third of the Israeli firms that had initially requested ranking from a rating agency decided to prevent publication. The findings show the average bond rankings published by Israeli rating agencies tend to be relatively high, while bond rating migration is relatively slow. There was no change in the shape of the statistical distribution of ratings between 2004 and 2007. The strategy of borrowers has remained stable and shows no change over 16 years of credit ratings in Israel. Practical implications: Debtors with an average quality debt view the publications of the credit agency as a weak signal and do not expect the investment community to give them better credit for an average grade. To obtain more detailed ratings, regulators along with the credit rating agencies should consider enforcement of the publication of the rank of firms that requested evaluation. Originality/value: The paper offers insights into why credit ratings in Israel have remained stable over the last decade and explains why Israeli firms with average quality debt do not change their strategy and do not request credit rating agencies to issue their grade publically which could then distinguish them from firms with worse quality debt. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bonds; Credit rating; Israel",,,,,,"Acharya, S., A generalized econometric model and tests of a signalling hypothesis with two discrete signals (1988) Journal of Finance, 43 (2), pp. 413-429; Altman, E.I., The importance and subtlety of credit rating migration (1998) Journal of Banking & Finance, 22, pp. 1231-1247; Altman, E.I., Kao, D.L., The implications of corporate bond ratings drift (1992) Financial Analysts Journal, 48 (3), pp. 64-75; www.mof.gov.il/bachar/pdf/bacharFullReport.pdf, Bachar Committee (2004), (accessed October 10, 2006); Bangia, A., Diebold, F.X., Kronimus, A., Schagen, C., Schuermann, T., Ratings migration and the business cycle, with application to credit portfolio stress testing (2002) Journal of Banking & Finance, 26 (2), pp. 445-474; (2009) Main Israeli Economic Data, , www.bankisrael.gov.il/deptdata/mehkar/indic/indice.htm, Bank of Israel, available at: (accessed June 5, 2009); Beaver, W.H., Shakespeare, C., Soliman, M.T., Differential properties in the ratings of certified versus non-certified bond-rating agencies (2006) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 42 (3), pp. 303-334; Byoun, S., Shin, Y., Unsolicited credit rating theory and empirical analysis (2002) Proceedings of the Midwest Business Economics, pp. 98-112; Faulkender, M., Petersen, M.A., Does the source of capital affect capital structure?

The philosophy of FSSF is based on the principles of environmental scanning and pattern management, which state that if there is a grand transformation process on the way or if there is a new emerging pattern or phenomenon, such a process will certainly be reflected in many different ways. Therefore, in this philosophy, futures knowledge is believed to be fragmented between various simultaneous and overlapping sources. Here, a researcher's task is to carry out a sufficient environmental scanning process and to cluster and sense how to create the emerging future through a pattern management process where FSSF plays a role as the first start-up tool. Alternatively, FSSF can also be used as a general knowledge management and sense-making tool for any kind of analyses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Melnikov function to determine the threshold of the detection system is introduced. The characteristic of Duffing oscillators with the changing of dynamics of the system is analysed. The method of detection of weak signals in strong noise based on Duffing oscillators is studied by exploiting characteristic of phase changing from chaos state to great periodic state of system nearby critical coefficient. Through analysing the intermittent chaos mechanism of Duffing oscillator, it was found that the system output is a intermittent chaotic signal when input frequency deviates the compulsory drive frequency slightly, and the deviation can be estimated by the statistic characteristic of output chaotic signal. The experiments results indicate that the signal detection method based on Duffing oscillator can detect weak sinusoidal signals with extremely low signal to noise ratio and accurately calculate to-be-detected signal frequency. © 2010 IEEE.","Duffing oscillator; Intermittent chaos; Melnikov function; Weak signals","Chaotic systems; E-learning; Electronic commerce; Oscillators (electronic); Signal to noise ratio; Chaos state; Chaotic signal; Detection system; Duffing oscillator; Input frequency; Intermittency transitions; Intermittent chaos; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Melnikov functions; Periodic state; Signal detection and estimation; Signal frequencies; Statistic characteristics; System output; Weak signal detection; Weak signals; Weak sinusoidal signals; Signal detection",,,,,"Wang, G., Chen, D., Lin, J., Chen, X., The Application of Chaotic Oscillators to Weak Signal Detection (1999) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 46 (2), pp. 440-444; Kapitaniak, T., (2000) Chaos for Engineers: Theory, Application, and Control, pp. 69-85. , Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg; Wang, G.-Y., He, S.-L., A quantitative study on detection and estimation of weak signals by using chaotic Duffing oscillators (2003) IEEE Transaction on Circuits and Systems I-fundamental Theory and Applications, 50 (7), pp. 945-953. , J; Glendinning, P., Perry, L.P., Melnikov analysis of chaos in a simple epidemiological model (1997) J.

Drawing from actor-network theory, non-human entities may ""translate"" new, unexpected stakeholders to support their aims. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a theoretical conceptual approach with three illustrative examples. Findings: The examples provided show that corporate crises result partly from previously unacknowledged non-human spheres of influence and cause corporations serious losses. Corporations that take a proactive stance and monitor the weak signals of change are able to improve their standing and maintain legitimacy. Research limitations/implications: The framework created requires more testing with different examples across contexts and cultures. Future studies should examine the process of translation more deeply and examine who can potentially be translated into a stakeholder. Practical implications: Corporate communication should play ""the devil's advocate"" on issues and analyze not only stakeholders, but also non-human entities that may be able to translate others into joining their cause.

Traditionally, it has been discussed in respect to telecommunications, information technologies and electronics. Subjects of this convergence often change what and where customers buy, with Apple's renowned iPhone being one current example for customers' tendency towards products with multiple benefits. More recently also the chemical and its related industries find themselves affected by a larger convergence process. Concentrating on developments at the outposts of the chemical industry, we discuss indications of convergence with an example from the area of Nutraceuticals and Cosmeceuticals. Furthermore, we present and discuss a multiple indicator concept for monitoring convergence in an R&D-intensive field on the basis of publicly available data. We analyze 7, 455 scientific and patent references on phytosterols with the aid of SciFinder Scholar and 3, 836 documents employing STN AnaVist. Our results show clear indications for convergence and a proof of principle for our monitoring concept. A closer look at convergence and effective tools for spotting weak signals appears to be necessary. Particularly for practitioners, the opportunity to get a head start on their current and future competitors is of high strategic importance. © 2009 PICMET.",,"Convergence process; Cosmeceuticals; Effective tool; Nutraceuticals; Proof of principles; Scientific discipline; Weak signals; Chemical industry; Competition; Customer satisfaction; Technology",,,,,"Agrawal, A., Henderson, R., Putting patents in context: Exploring knowledge transfer from MIT (2002) Management Science, 48, pp. 44-60. , Jan; Bainbridge, W.S., Transformative Concepts in Scientific Convergence (2006) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1093, pp. 24-45; Bierly, P., Chakrabarti, A.K., Managing through industry fusion (1999) The dynamics of innovation: Strategic and managerial implications, pp. 7-26. , K.

Specifically, the paper investigates how the individual strength of a marketplace signal varies as a function of whether consumers are exposed to that signal alone or in combination with another signal. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses experimental designs to empirically address the research questions. Hypotheses are formulated primarily based on signaling theory and these hypotheses are tested with laboratory experiments using real consumers. Findings - The key finding is that a signal's stand-alone credibility largely determines whether its individual strength would be diluted or augmented by the coexistence of another signal. Further, when signals with different stand-alone strengths coexist, the individual strength of the weaker signal is higher than when that signal is present alone. These effects are observed in brick-and-mortar and online shopping media. Originality/value - Past research reports mixed findings about whether the individual strength of a signal is diluted (dilution effect) or augmented (augmentation effect) by the presence of another signal. This research attempts to resolve this issue, for the first time, by demonstrating that whether dilution effect or augmentation effect occurs depends on the stand-alone credibility of the individual signals in a mix. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Internet shopping; Signal processing theory",,,,,,"Akerlof, G.A., The market for 'lemons': Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84 (3), pp. 488-500; Alba, J.W., Lynch, J., Weitz, B., Janiszewski, C., Lutz, R., Sawyer, A., Wood, S., Interactive home shopping: Consumer, retailer, and manufacturer incentives to participate in electronic marketplaces (1997) Journal of Marketing, 61, pp. 38-53. , July; Anderson, N.H., Integration theory and attitude change (1971) Psychological Review, 78 (3), pp. 171-206; Barone, M.J., Taylor, V.A., Urbany, J.A., Advertising signaling effects for new brands: The moderating role of perceived brand differences (2005) Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, pp. 1-13. , Winter; Bart, I.Y., Shankar, V., Sultan, F., Urban, G., Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

This attempt takes place within the effort that futures studies have deployed to cope with the need to be 'early' in change processes, and is intended to improve firms' preparedness regarding uncertainties, threats and opportunities. The weak signal notion is one of the metaphors coined to accomplish that, thanks to the seminal role played by Igor Ansoff in the 1970s and 1980s, and the inputs of more recent continuators who have shaped a wide methodological environment. After over 20 years of weak signal exploration, some pending issues suggest the need to re-open some basic hypotheses as well as the use of a wide-angle lens to review the Ansoff legacy and its relevance for management and decision-making. The concepts of framing and meta-framing are the means that will allow us to do this by adding a more reflexive dimension to weak signal analysis, taking account of analysts' and commissioning organisations' own biases, and enhancing firms' robustness against possibly disruptive futures. Pragmatic managerial orientations of how to make use of methodological blends involving reflexive steps will be outlined, also suggesting diverse tracks for further research on weak signal theories and their contributions to both futures studies and strategic management.","Constructivism; Framing; Paradigmatic biases; Reflexivity; Weak signal","decision making; future prospect; hypothesis testing; management practice; signal; strategic approach; theoretical study; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Adam, B., Has the future already happened?

It focuses on how it could be possible to analyse emerging trends from actor's strategies toward the future. The main research question is to understand how early signals of new trends appear in a field which is not formally stabilised. We looked at the spontaneously produced categorisations (folksonomy) of 250 start-ups. This corpus is analysed in order to explore how these descriptions identify key future evolutions and how these categorisations of future trends change over time. Our central hypothesis is to consider that early elements of future changes (weak signals) are not given once and for all, but exist within perpetual shifting processes and could be tracked with folksonomic maps. The discussion of the results will suggest that weak signals should not be conceptualised as static entities blessed with some strange power to shape the future but as a set of components, whose main features are their abilities to be constantly rearranged among themselves by the involved actors.","Folksonomy; Future trends; User driven categorisation; Weak signals; Web 2.0","conceptual framework; future prospect; hypothesis testing; information technology; innovation; Internet; signal; technological change; trend analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Ball, P., (2004) Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another, , Arrow Books, London; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: Designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Third American Conference on Information Systems (AIS) Conference, , Paper presented at the Indianapolis USA; Bloor, D., (1976) Knowledge and Social Imagery, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Berlin, B., (2002) Ethnobiological Classification: Principles of Categorization of Plants and Animals in Traditional Societies, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T.J., (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in The Sociology and The History of Technology, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Bijker, W.E., Law, J., (1992) Shaping Technology/building Society, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Coffman, B., (1997) Weak Signal Research, , MG Taylor Corporation; Fitzgerald, M., Tagging tools offer powerful way to organize information (2006) CIO Magazine; Glassey, O., When taxonomy meets folksonomy: Towards hybrid classification of knowledge?

The aim of this article is to discuss the usefulness of developing foresight in a business wargame. Wargaming, a role-playing simulation of a dynamic situation, has been used mainly by the military, but more recently, it has also been used in the context of competitive intelligence and strategy-testing in organisations. A business wargame typically evolves several years into the future, allowing the participants to 'experience' future dynamics in the organisational environment and, consequently, to develop foresight. This article argues that, because of its participative and dynamic nature, business wargaming can overcome cognitive barriers, challenge mental models, detect weak signals of change in an organisational environment, re-direct attention in an organisation, and assist an organisation in developing foresight.","Business wargaming; Foresight; Scenario planning; Weak signals","business; computer simulation; future prospect; organizational framework; signal",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York; Andlinger, G.R., Looking around: What can business games do?

At the same time, the fact remains that unless the contextual differences with developed economies are accounted for, researchers could misspecify research designs. The pace of evolution of 'context' in emerging economies, coupled with 'weak signals' emanating from sparsely distributed data points calls for the primacy of idiographic explanations, such as those afforded by the case study method. As case research links observations, experiences and underlying mechanisms, it allows the researcher to tackle problems associated with continuous transformation of institutional arrangements in emerging economies. In contrast, a researcher employing conventional survey research in such settings may not be alert to either the presence of unfamiliar contingencies or the operation of hitherto dormant mechanisms, resulting in low 'validity.' Furthermore, such survey research would have low 'reliability' due to low statistical power of the significance tests. With its potential for higher validity and higher reliability under such circumstances, we argue that the case study method is a more appropriate and powerful tool to capture rich data for theory building in emerging economies.","Case study method; Emerging economies; Research design","Continuous transformations; Developed economies; Dim light; Distributed data points; Emerging economies; Institutional arrangement; Research design; Research designs; Research fields; Significance test; Statistical power; Study methods; Survey research; Theory building; Underlying mechanism; Weak signals; Reliability theory; Surveys; Research",,,,,"Boyacigiller, N.A., Adler, N.J., The parochial dinosaur: Organizational science in a global context (1991) Academy of Management Review, 16, pp. 262-290; George, A.L., Bennett, A., (2005) Case Studies and Theory Development in the Social Sciences, , MIT Press; Hoskisson, R.E., Eden, L., Lau, C.M., Wright, M., Strategy in emerging economies (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43, pp. 249-267; King, G., Keohane, R.O., Verba, S., (1994) Designing Social Inquiry, , Princeton University Press; Labovitz, S., Criteria for selecting a significance level: A note on the sacredness of. 05 (1968) American Sociologist, 3, pp. 200-222; Lee, T.W., (1999) Using Qualitative Methods in Organizational Research, , Sage Publications; Johns, G., Praise of context (2001) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 22, pp. 31-42; Johns, G., The essential impact of context on organizational behavior (2006) Academy of Management Review, 31, pp. 386-408; Morgan, G., Smircich, L., The case for qualitative research (1980) Academy of Management Review, 5, pp. 491-500; Narayanan, V.K., Fahey, L., The relevance of the institutional underpinnings of porter's five forces framework to emerging economies: An epistemological analysis (2005) Journal of Management Studies, 42, pp. 207-223; Numagami, T., The infeasibility of invariant laws in management studies: A reflective dialogue in defense of case studies (1998) Organization Science, 9, pp. 2-15; Pondy, L.R., Olson, M.L., Theories of extreme cases (1977) The American Psychological Association Symposium, , Paper presented at San Francisco, CA; Popper, K.R., (1959) The Logic of Scientific Discovery, , London: Hutchinson & Co; Rosnow, R.L., Rosenthal, R., Statistical procedures and the justification of knowledge in psychological science (1989) American Psychologist, 44, pp. 1276-1284; Rousseau, D.M., Fried, Y., Location, location, location: Contextualizing organizational research (2001) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 22, pp. 1-13; Stoecker, R., Evaluating and rethinking the case study (1991) Sociological Review, 39, pp. 88-112; Tsoukas, H., The validity of idiographic research explanations (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 551-561; Wright, M., Filatotchev, I., Hoskisson, R.E., Peng, M.W., Strategy research in emerging economies: Challenging the conventional wisdom (2005) Journal of Management Studies, 42, pp. 1-33; Van Maanen, J., Style as theory (1995) Organization Science, 6, pp. 133-143; White, S., Rigor and relevance in Asian management research: Where are we and where can we go?

Even though all big companies operate innovation units, managing innovations effectively split the champions from the vast majority. By utilising and combining well-known management and innovation instruments, i.e., Balanced Score Card (BSC) and Roadmaps, this paper presents a way, how to master this challenge. Whereas Roadmaps provide important information about distant future scenarios (markets, technologies, etc.) and the company's corresponding development paths (products, skills), the innovation-adjusted BSC - called Balanced Innovation Card (BIC) translates the Roadmap into clear and measurable objectives and performance indicators. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.","Balanced Innovation Card; BIC; From weak signals to defined actions; Innovation unit; Roadmap","Innovation; Management; Roads and streets; Technology transfer; Balanced Innovation Card; Innovation management; Roadmap; Mapping",,,,,"Kaplan, R.S., Norton, D.P., (1997) Balanced Scorecard, pp. 66, 144, 168. , Schäffer-Poeschel, pp; Möhrle, M.G., Isenmann, R., (2005) Grundlagen des Technologie-Roadmapping, Technologie-Roadmapping - Zukunftsstrategien für Technologieunternehmen, p. 5. , 2nd ed, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Berlin, p; Schäfer, A., Wie ein rollendes Heim (2000) Wirtschaftswoche, (8), p. 164; Vinkemeier, R., Roadmapping statt Glaskugel beim Blick in die Zukunft (1999) Handelsblatt, (71), pp. b14; Weber, J., (2002) Einführung in das Controlling, p. 73. , 9th ed, Schäffer-Poeschel, p; Weber, J., Vinkemeier, R., Controlling und innovation', Advanced Controlling, Vol. 56 (2007) WILEY-VCH Verlag, p. 40. , Weinheim, p; Weber, J., Kandel, O., Spitzner, J., Vinkemeier, R., Unternehmenssteuerung mit szenarien und simulationen', Advanced Controlling (2005) WILEY-VCH Verlag, 47, p. 21; Weber, J., Radtke, B., Schäfer, U., Erfahrungen mit der balanced scorecard revisited (2006) Advanced Controlling, 50, p. 10. , WILEY-VCH Verlag, Weinheim, 13 and 69","Vinkemeier, R.; Managing Partner CTcon, Fankfurt, Düsseldorf, Germany; email: r.vinkemeier@ctcon.de",,,,,,,,17402832,,,,"English","Int.

However, changes in population distribution, population composition, family structures and tourism preferences pose a reason to challenge the general assumption that second home tourism would continue unchanged in the future. This paper reviews representations of the future of second home tourism in the Finnish media and policy discourse. Mainstream trends and emerging weak signals are recognized and further analysed in reference to the international context. As a result of the analysis four distinctive themes related to the future of second home tourism are distinguished: dual dwelling, internationalization, alternative forms and regional differentiation. These themes suggest a change in the traditional Finnish second home culture, often portrayed as a personal and national utopia. With the exception of dual dwelling, all the themes have so far been overlooked in the official policy discourse. The paper addresses a new theme in Finnish as well as international second home literature as so far only little has been published on the long term future of second home tourism.","Media discourse; Policy discourse; Second home tourism; Trends; Weak signals","family structure; future prospect; globalization; mass media; mobility; policy strategy; population distribution; second home; signal; tourism; trend analysis; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",,,,,"Buller, H., Hoggart, K., The social integration of British home owners into French rural communities (1994) Journal of Rural Studies, 10 (2), pp. 197-210; Coppock, J.T., Second homes in perspective (1977) Second Homes: Curse or Blessing?, pp. 1-15. , Pergamon, Oxford; Dijst, M., Lanzendorf, M., Barendregt, A., Smit, L., Second homes in Germany and the Netherlands: Ownership and travel impact explained (2004) Tijdschrift Voor Economishce En Sociale Geografie, 96 (2), pp. 139-152; Duval, T.D., Mobile migrants: Travel to second homes (2004) Tourism, Mobility and Second Homes.

Weak signals are current oddities, strange issues that are thought to be in key position in anticipating future changes in organizational environments. Scanning for them and using them in scenario work is thought to be successful for looking to the future. However, defining weak signals is problematic, and various authors term the concept differently. The debate about the characteristics of weak signals has been active especially in Finland. The article aims to develop a deeper theoretical understanding of weak signals. For this purpose, a semiotic approach, Peirce's triadic model of sign in particular, is used. The article introduces a new starting point for defining weak signals (signs) by using the novel concept future sign, which consists of three dimensions: the signal, the issue and the interpretation. © 2007.",,"modeling; organizational change; signal; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Contrib Title: Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, XVIII (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Contrib Title: Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; I.H.

Solid-state TV tuners can help resolve time-consuming manufacture and test processes and other issues, including multiple standards, integration, size and power consumption. The primary technical differences in tuner design considerations between mobile phone applications and broadcast TV are bandwidth, interference and dynamic range. The fact that T signals carried over cable have fairly uniform signal strength from channel to channel allows early ICs to be deployed in cable TV receivers. Tuners must be sensitive to very weak signals, including incoming TV signals close to the receiver noise floor, even in the presence of strong interference.

Yet, this narrow concentration of focus risks overlooking issues, events and transformations occurring at the periphery of corporate awareness that may threaten the survival of the organisation or provide opportunities for expansion. Being able to take in peripheral vision may therefore be crucial to an organisation's wellbeing. In this paper, we discuss how teams may play a crucial role in improving peripheral vision and awareness through their function and orientation. We identify a number of different functions of teams and develop a typology that shows how different types of teams orientate themselves in dealing with focal and peripheral issues. In particular we examine the cases of teams that are most orientated toward the periphery: minimally-structured and immersion teams, and show how each employs specific practices - namely zooming, improvisation, bricolage, scenario thinking, wild cards and weak signals - to sharpen peripheral vision and awareness. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper's dynamic capabilities- and strategic options-based framework is comprised of the following key issues: how to sense the weak signals at the customer interface and how to formulate them as strategic options; how to exercise these options in the (often) intangible assets markets that are imperfect or even non-existent; how to appropriate and/or share strategically relevant productive knowledge in order to obtain competitive advantage (CA) over the rivals, (iv) how to recognize the opportunities and threats of the underlying industrial structure, especially the economies of scale and scope and network externalities; and how to proactively reconfigure and reshape the existing knowledge base and capabilities in order to sustain the CA obtained. Design/methodology/approach - The paradigm of creating CA is opened up in the context of knowledge-based engineering and digital manufacturing. The Porterian five forces model, the resource-based view and especially its dynamized extension, the dynamic capability view, are used as theoretical starting points. The modern strategic technology management literature will be complemented by means of the concepts of strategic options and related flexibility issues. Some illustrative examples will be offered as well. Findings - In the author's view, the primary sources of sustainable CA in the digital manufacturing can be captured from active asset selection (strategic investments in both tangible and intangible assets), and efficient orchestrating of the global value net in ""thin"" intangible assets markets. The main determinants of CA are: the competitive nature of external environments, supply and demand conditions of the industry (economies of scale and scope and network externalities), renewal capacity of the organization, the dependence on complementary co-specialized resources and capabilities, and the strategic role of the appropriability regime. Originality/value - This paper tries to capture the critical elements of creating sustainable CA in the context of digital manufacturing and it is considered to be useful for strategic decision-makers. The modern technology strategy management literature is synthesized in our framework and it tries to make the issues more applicable to the strategic management of the companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive advantage; Manufacturing industries; Strategic manufacturing; Transaction costs","Competitive intelligence; Costs; Digital control systems; Mathematical models; Strategic planning; Competitive advantage (CA); Manufacturing firms; Manufacturing industries; Strategic manufacturing; Transaction costs; Industrial management",,,,,"Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options.

Expo/ Calle Inca Garcilaso s/n, E-41092 Sevilla, Spain","Online Social Networks (OSNs) have gained unprecedented popularity in recent years. OSNs facilitate the interaction among members by providing a dynamic/multimodal platform which enables discussions, sharing of multimedia content, organisation of events, etc. These networks comprise millions of members from all continents and from all age groups - although the younger generation is more prominent. OSN dynamics and inherent patterns of operation are being investigated by academia as a means of studying, for instance, ICT-enhanced social change. Industry uses them to detect new commercial trends and establish marketing strategies. We believe that the huge size of OSNs, the broad and versatile thematic topics and the fact that most users are youngsters made these new modalities of large-scale interaction also worth investigating in regard to the study of the future or foresight. In this paper, we discuss the relevance of OSNs for three objectives of foresight methods, namely creativity, expertise and collective intelligence. First, we argue that OSNs can be regarded as a tool to enhance creativity through the unprecedented modalities of communication and interaction they offer. Second, we propose OSNs as an expert tool to detect emerging changes in social behaviour. We assume that the recorded exchanges of information and thoughts between participants in forums offers an under-exploited source of information for detecting new social trends. The value of this information may be amplified by evaluating it in conjunction with other OSN data, such as member profiles, behavioural patterns or list of contacts or friends. In this way, emerging social trends could be detected. Similar approaches are already used in market research and could be transferred to foresight. Third, we consider OSNs to be a means of aligning individual thinking and fostering collective or ""collaborative"" intelligence for a whole range of possible goals in the future. For each of these three objectives, the theoretical foundations are complemented with some case studies. Given the novelty of the OSN phenomenon and its unexplored potential in many fields, the authors aim to trigger thinking and discussion on the potential application of this emerging phenomenon within foresight, rather than to offer a vademecum on the use of OSNs for foresight activities. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we draw upon complementary evolutionary perspectives and discuss these objectives from the viewpoint of diversity which may be vital in contexts characterized by technological discontinuities and high uncertainties. We also argue that although the scanning of weak signals has been widely advocated in such contexts, the solicitation of ideas for prospective innovations may provide more focused, action-oriented, and comparable reflections of future developments. For the analysis of such ideas, we develop a collaborative foresight method RPM Screening which consists of phases for the generation, revision, multi-criteria evaluation, and portfolio analysis of innovation ideas. We also report experiences from a pilot project where this method was employed to enhance the work of the Foresight Forum of the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Finland. Encouraging results from this project and other recent applications suggest that RPM Screening can be helpful in foresight processes and the development of shared research agendas. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Some have argued that NASA's failure to respond with appropriate intensity to the so-called foam strike that led to the accident was evidence of irresponsible or incompetent management. The authors' research, however, suggests that NASA was exhibiting a natural, albeit unfortunate, pattern of behavior common in many organizations. The foam strike is a prime example of what the authors call an ambiguous threat-a signal that may or may not portend future harm. Ambiguous threats differ from threats with obvious causes-say, a fire in the building-for which the response is clear. They also differ from unmistakable threats that may lack straightforward response paths (such as the frightening oxygen-tank explosion aboard Apollo 13). However, when the warning sign is ambiguous and the threat's potential effect is unclear, managers may choose to ignore or discount the risk. Such an approach can be catastrophic. Firms that do a good job of dealing with ambiguous threats do not improvise during a crisis; rather, they apply a rigorous set of detection and response capabilities that they have developed and practiced beforehand. In this article, the authors outline how to put such capabilities in place long before a crisis strikes. First, companies need to hone their teamwork and rapid problem-solving skills through practice. Second, they must learn to recognize weak signals, amplify the threat, and encourage employees to ask disconcerting ""what if"" questions in a safe environment Finally, they should explore possible responses to threats through quick, low-cost experimentation.",,"article; commercial phenomena; methodology; organization and management; risk assessment; United States; Commerce; Risk Assessment; United States",,,,,,"Roberto, M.A.; Department of Management, Bryant University, Smithfield, RI, United States; email: mroberto@bryant.edu",,,,,,,,00178012,,HABRA,"17131567","English","Harv.

Ansoff, Implanting Strategic Management, Prentice-Hall International, Englewood-Cliffs, NJ, 1984). Currently the weak signals approach is experiencing a renaissance in strategic planning but now either in the context of strategic flexibility or peripheral vision. In this paper we aim, firstly, to present theories describing filters that a weak signal has to pass in the strategy-creation process. Secondly, we present a construction for information filters in the strategy process and prove that the nature of objectives and the method used in environment scanning have a major impact on the outcome.

Noise radar can hide its signal in wideband noise, which makes it undetectable by the enemy and it can image objects right through concrete walls. A high-speed shift register for random noise or a first-in-first-out shift register (FIFO) to load pseudorandom waveforms can be used to build a noise radar with worth $100. The noise radar signal becomes undetectable to normal radar receivers by spreading low-level noise across gigahertz of radio spectrum that are designed to look for high-level signals and to filter out weak signals. It has a few gigahertz of bandwidth and the receiver is just a microwave mixer with a low-pass filter having a cutoff of 10 to 100 kHz. Millitary applications can use noise radar to analyze reflections for the size and shape of the objects imaged, its composition, and function.",,"Bandwidth; Low pass filters; Military applications; Reflection; Signal receivers; Spurious signal noise; First-in-first-out shift register (FIFO); Noise radar; Pseudorandom waveforms; Radio spectrum; Radar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,01921541,,,,"English","Electron.

The revenue and expenditure statements and balance sheets have been published under the new system for the last three years on a timely basis. The system has been running smoothly for a few years and is on steady stream and it can be taken as a case of successful implementation of accounting reform. It is an appropriate case to highlight the synergistic effect of synchronizing organizational change, reengineering of processes, modernization of accounting system, and automation of accounts. It is quite difficult in this process to single out the factors that contributed maximum to the effectiveness of the Modern Accounting System (MAS) as implemented in BMP. It is equally difficult to attribute everything to the new accounting system. It can also be seen as a case of change management in the accounting system domain. The case of the BMP illustrates the changes that were brought about in the accounting system. The new accounting system — MAS — adopts the best of fund-based accounting system, accrual system, and reporting system. Its contrast with cash accounting system, its advancement over the old system, and compliance with national accounting standards are also discussed. The organizational and change contexts are presented to help understand the drivers of change. The salient features of the accounting system implemented in BMP are: compatibility with accounting standards granularity dovetailing accounting system to organizational reengineering. Comprehensive management information reporting system. Compatibility with accounting standards granularity dovetailing accounting system to organizational reengineering comprehensive management information reporting system. The implementation is analysed as a case of change management process of implementing of accounting reforms in municipal organizations. MAS is analysed through the framework of management control system which helps to integrate various dimensions of institutional factors that go with accounting reform. MAS is also analysed for its contribution towards accounting information for strategic control, management control, and operational control. It was observed that even though the system has features for decision making and control, it is primarily used for operations and compliance. The focus is still more on transactional level than control or decision level. The case raises interesting issues about the following: the purpose of the accounting reform. Sustenance of the old system. Demand for the new system. Areas where accounting reforms took off. Areas where reforms did not happen. Incentives to maintain status quo and incentives to change which are discussed through the control system framework. The purpose of the accounting reform sustenance of the old system demand for the new system areas where accounting reforms took off areas where reforms did not happen incentives to maintain status quo and incentives to change which are discussed through the control system framework. One area where we can find the reasons are the triggers for change. The change drivers are discussed in terms of changes in the financing pattern, exposure to market borrowings and ratings, introduction of user charges, and passing of Transparency Act. Ultimately, it is suggested that the change drivers, though helpful, in ushering in the changes, can slow down the pace if the signals are weak. Weak signals could result in reinforcing the existing agency relationships. © 2006 SAGE Publications.","Accrual Accounting; Change Management Process in Accounting Reforms; Control System; Fund-based Accounting; Municipal Accounting Reforms",,,,,,"Anthony, R.N., Govindarajan, V., (2004) Management Control System, , Delhi: Tata Mcgraw Hill; Anthony, R.N., Young, D.W., (2003) Management Control in Non Profit Organizations, , New York: McGraw Hill; (2004) Accrual Budgeting and Accounting in Government and Its Relevance for Dmcs, , Manila: Asian Development Bank; Durand, E.D., The Municipal Accounting Maze: An Analysis of Political Incentives (1898) Journal of Accounting Research, 15, pp. 107-144. , The Finances of New York City, New York: Macmillan, as quoted in Zimmerman, Jerold L (1977); (1980) Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No2, , Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information, Stamford: FASB; Gandhi, S., (2005) Gaps in ‘GAAP’ Issues in Nonprofit Accounting and Reporting in India, , WP No 2005–03–03, Ahmedabad: Indian Institute of Management; (1987) Summary of Concept Statement No1,Gasb, , http://www.gasb.org/st/concepts/gconsum1.html, retrieved on 9.10.2005; Joshi, R., (2003) Succeeding in Municipal Accounting Reform: The Gujarat, , Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka Experience, in India Infrastructure Report 2003: Public Expenditure Allocation and Accountability, New Delhi: 3i Network, Oxford University Press; Miller, P.B.W., (1995) The Conceptual Framework as Reformation and Counter-Reformation, pp. 86-97. , Bloom, Robert and Elgers, Pieter, T Issues in Accounting Policy, Florida: The Dryden Press; Pangotra, P., Srihari, P.K., (2003) Innovations in Municipal Budgeting and Financial Management Systems in Bangalore Mahanagara Palike, in India Best Practices Catalogue 2003, , http://www.icma-india.org/bpsymposium2003.html, En Route to Urban Reforms; Robertson, W., Going Broke the New York Way (1975) Journal of Accounting Research, 15, pp. 107-144. , Fortune, as quoted in Zimmerman, Jerold L (1977); Simons, R., (1994) Levers of Control: How Managers Use Innovative Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal, , Boston: Harvard Business School Press; Weber, R., (2005) Information System Control and Audit, , Delhi: Pearson Education; Zimmerman, J.L., The Municipal Accounting Maze: An Analysis of Political Incentives (1977) Journal of Accounting Research, 15, pp. 107-144",,,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,02560909,,,,"English","Vikalpa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025440181

The 42 cases are arranged around the European phase-out of the use of lead-bearing solders in electronics manufacturing in 2006. We found that the outside-in perspective is the main source of information about upcoming issues. Sensing weak signals is the prevailing mechanism to become aware of these topics. Even though hints about the necessity to phase out a technology are known long before, customer push and strict regulatory requirements have been found to be the most important triggers for systematic actions by companies. © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","controversial technologies; issue identification; lead-bearing solders; technology management",,,,,,"Achleitner, P., (1985) Sozio-politische Strategien Multinationaler Unternehmungen, , Bern: Verlag Paul Haupt; Adams, J., (2001) Risk, , London: Routledge; Aerni, P., Risk, regulation and innovation: the case of aquaculture and transgenic fish (2004) Aquatic Sciences, 66, pp. 327-341; Ames, B.N., Gold, L.S., Environmental pollution and cancer: some misconceptions (1993) Phantom Risk: Scientific Interference and the Law, , K.R.

How can they see these changes sooner and capitalize on them? Such changes often begin as weak signals on what the authors call the periphery, or the blurry zone at the edge of an organization's vision. As with human peripheral vision, these signals are difficult to see and interpret but can be vital to success or survival. Unfortunately, most companies lack a systematic method for determining where on the periphery they should be looking, how to interpret the weak signals they see, and how to allocate limited scanning resources. This article provides such a method-a question-based framework for helping companies scan the periphery more efficiently and effectively. The framework divides questions into three categories: learning from the past (What have been our past blind spots? What instructive analogies do other industries offer? Who in the industry is skilled at picking up weak signals and acting on them?); evaluating the present (What important signals are we rationalizing away? What are our mavericks, outliers, complainers, and defectors telling us? What are our peripheral customers and competitors really thinking?); and envisioning the future (What future surprises could really hurt or help us? What emerging technologies could change the game? Is there an unthinkable scenario that might disrupt our business?). Answering these questions is a good first step toward anticipating problems or opportunities that may appear on the business horizon. The article concludes with a self-test that companies can use to assess their need and capability for peripheral vision.",,"commercial phenomena; economic aspect; organization and management; review; United States; Commerce; Economic Competition; United States",,,,,,"Day, G.S.; Department of Marketing, University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, United States; email: dayg@wharton.upenn.edu",,,,,,,,00178012,,HABRA,"16299966","English","Harv.

Design/methodology/approach - Early detection and rapid action with respect to developments in the operating environment is a prerequisite for successful marketing planning. Accordingly, this paper proposes a three-stage process for overcoming practical obstacles to the detection and use of weak signals from the operating environment, in particular how to identify relevant and useful documents in harsh information environments such as the internet. Its functionality is demonstrated by means of a human-machine experiment. Findings - A framework based on information foraging theory is well suited to the task of determining the relevance of documents and facilitates the automation of information search processes. A prototype environmental scanning system of this type outperformed human experts in a typical scanning task. Research limitations/implications - Embedding the detection of weak signals in a formal process permits intelligence gatherers to step beyond anecdotal evidence, and complements the current literature on weak signal detection with formal and systematic procedural guidelines. Practical implications - The presented methodology facilitates both the selection and the structuring of information sources. This unburdens the managers and leaves time for important tasks such as the development of concrete marketing plans reacting to detected developments. Originality/value - The paper provides a comprehensive framework for web-based weak signal detection in business environments, and can be used as a string point for the development of practicable environmental scanning systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business environment;

Among other things, networks keep them up-to-date with changes in the economy and allow them to take advantage of opportunities to innovate, thus remaining ahead of their competitors. The networks - personal or business - with which these firms interact the most are usually geographically or sociologically close by, embedded in the environment, and are known as strong tie networks. They generally supply signals in a familiar language, based on habit as well a good reciprocal knowledge, which are easy to understand. In addition to this, however, the most dynamic firms also have contacts with weak tie networks, which are further removed from the usual behaviours of entrepreneurs and provide weak signals that, while difficult to grasp and decode, nevertheless offer new, pre-competitive information that can support major innovations. Very little empirical research has been done so far to test the probability of this theory. This paper reports on the results of a survey involving 147 SMEs, all in the land-based transportation equipment sector. It confirms the importance of weak tie networks as opposed to other types of networks, recognizing their complementary contribution to technological innovation. The organization's absorptive capacity is also found to be a significant intermediary factor in taking advantage of weak tie networks. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.","Absorptive capacity; SMEs; Strong and weak signals; Strong tie networks; Technological innovation; Weak tie networks","competition (economics); entrepreneur; innovation; small and medium-sized enterprise; technological development",,,,,"Albernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Innovation mapping the winds of creature destruction (1985) Research Policy, 14 (1), pp. 3-22; Amendola, M., Gaffard, J., (1988) la Dynamique Économique de L'innovation, , Paris: Economica; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Birley, S., Cromie, S., Myers, A., Entrepreneurial networks: Their emergence in Ireland and overseas (1991) International Small Business Journal, 9 (4), pp. 56-74; Bourdieu, P., (1967) Choses Dites, , Paris: Édition de Minuit; Brush, C., Market place information scanning activities of new manufacturing ventures (1992) Journal of Small Business Management, 30 (4), pp. 41-53; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Carrier, C., Garand, D., (1996) le Concept D'innovation: Débats et Ambiguités, , Communication to the 5th International Conference on Strategic Management, Lille, 13-15 May; Chollet, B., (2002) L'analyse des Réscaux Sociaux: Quelques Implications Pour le Champ de L'entrepreneuriat, , Communication to the 6th International French Speaking Congress on Small Business, 29 Oct-1 Nov, Montréal, Québec; Choo, C.W., (1999) The Intelligent Organization: Mobilizing Organizational Knowledge Through Information Partnerships, , Working Papers, Information Studies Department, Toronto University, Toronto; Cohen, W., Levinthal, D., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (1), pp. 128-152; Cohen, W., Levinthal, D., Fortune favors the prepared firm (1994) Management Science, 40, pp. 227-251; Collinson, S., Knowledge networks for innovation in small Scottish software firms (2000) Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 12, pp. 217-244; Dewar, R., Dutton, J., The adoption of radical and incremental innovations: An empirical analysis (1986) Management Science, 32, pp. 1422-1433; Drakopoulou Dodd, S., Patra, E., National difference in entrepreneurial networking (2002) Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 14 (2), pp. 117-134; Eliasson, G., (1990) The Knowledge-based Information Economy, , (ed.)

Building on current conceptual and empirical research, we suggest an analytical approach to the management of surprising and potentially damaging events. In order to do so we propose the wild card management system. Wild cards refer to sudden and unique incidents that can constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend. As the first of the two components of such a wild card system, we advocate a weak signal methodology to take into account those wild cards that can be anticipated by scanning the decision environment. The second component, the nurture of improvisation capabilities, is designed to deal with unanticipated ongoing crises. This paper can be seen as part of a broader agenda on how to manage in conditions of continuous but unpredictable change. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"management; organizational framework",,,,,"van der Heijden, K., Scenarios (1996) The Art of Conversation, , Chichester: John Willey - Sons; Rockfellow, J.D., Wild cards: Preparing for 'Big One' (1994) The Futurist, 1, pp. 14-19. , January-February; Petersen, J.L., (1999) Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises?, , Lanham: Madison; Mitroff, I.I., Pearson, C., Harrington, K., (1996) The Essential Guide to Managing Corporate Crises, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Mitroff, I.I., Pearson, C.M., (1993) Crisis Management: A Diagnostic Guide for Improving Your Organization's Crisis-preparedness, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Mitroff, I.I., Anagnos, G., (2000) Managing Crises Before They Happen: What Every Executive Needs to Know About Crisis Management, , New York, NY: Amacom; Reid, J.L., (2000) Crisis Management: Planning and Media Relations for the Design and Construction Industry, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management: Cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, p. 18. , Winter; Coffman, B.S., Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, January 15, 1997, MG Taylor Corporation; Ansoff, I., (1982) Strategic Response to Turbulent Environments, , Working Paper No. 82-35, Brussels: European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management; Makridakis, S., Wheelwright, S.C., (1989) Forecasting Methods for Management, , New York: John Wiley and Sons Fifth ed; Armstrong, J.S., (2001) Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practioners, , Boston: Kluwer; Preble, J., Reichel, A., The environmental scanning practices of US multinationals in the late 1980's (1988) Management International Review, 28 (4), pp. 4-14; Thomas, P., Environmental scanning: The state of the art (1980) Long Range Planning, 13 (1), pp. 20-25; Renfro, W., (1993) Issues Management in Strategic Planning, , Westport, Connecticut: Quorum Books; Meristö, T., (1991) Scenario Building in the Management of Companies (in Finnish), Finnish Society for Future Studies, Acta Futura Fennica VAPK-Kustannus, 3. , Valtion painatuskeskus, Helsinki; Amara, R., The futures field (1981) Futurist, 15, pp. 25-29; Rubin, A., Kaivo-oja, J., Towards a futures-oriented sociology (1999) Revue Internationale de Sociologie, 9 (3), pp. 349-371; Kamoche, K., Cunha, M.P., Cunha, J.V., (2002) Organizational Improvisation, , (Eds.), London: Routledge; Cunha, M.P., Cunha, J.V., Kamoche, K., Organizational improvisation: What, when, how and why (1999) International Journal of Management Reviews, 1, pp. 299-341; Miner, A.S., Bassoff, P., Moorman, C., Organizational improvisation and learning: A field study (2001) Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, pp. 304-337; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management: Cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, pp. 15-20. , Winter; Weick, K.E., The collapse of sensemaking in organizations: The Mann Gulch disaster (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38, pp. 628-652; Bigley, G.A., Roberts, K.H., The incident command system: High-reliability organizing for complex and volatile task environments (2001) Academy of Management Journal, 44, pp. 1281-1299; Grabowski, M., Roberts, K.H., Risk mitigation in virtual organizations (1999) Organization Science, 10, pp. 704-721; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, pp. 1-34; Adler, P.S., Goldoftas, B., Levine, D.I., Flexibility versus efficiency? a case study of model changeovers in the Toyota production system (1999) Organization Science, 10, pp. 43-68; Lanzara, G.F., Organizing a fashion show (2001) The 1st International Symposium on Organizational Improvisation, , Lisbon, June; Hannan, M.T., Freeman, J., The population ecology of organizations (1977) American Journal of Sociology, 82, pp. 924-964; Argyris, C., (1990) Overcoming Organizational Defenses, , Boston: Allyn and Bacon; Cunha, J.V., Cunha, M.P., Faia-Correia, M., Scenarios for improvisation: Long range planning redeemed (2001) Journal of General Management, 27 (2), pp. 67-80; McGrath, R.G., MacMillan, I.C., Venkataraman, S., Defining and developing competence: A strategic process paradigm (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 251-275; Weick, K.E., The aesthetic of imperfection in orchestras and organizations (1999) Comportamento Organizacional E Gestão, 5, pp. 5-22; Sitkin, S.B., Learning through failure: The strategy of small losses (1992) Research in Organizational Behavior, 14, pp. 231-266. , B.

Key concepts of the article are ""technological ""technological generalization"" and ""leitbild."" The topics in the technology foresight Delphi studies can be seen as different kinds of generalizations from already realized technological developments. Leitbild is a German word. Its most general meaning is a guiding image. Like a common vision, a leitbild creates a shared overall goal, offers orientation toward one long-term overall goal, and provides a basis for different professions and disciplines to work in the same direction. The analysis of leitbilder and emerging technological paradigms might contribute to the construction of topics and issues and to the argumentation processes related to them. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.","Delphi; Foresight; Leitbild; Millennium project; Nanotechnology; Technological generalization; Technological paradigm; Technology foresight; Weak signal","Construction; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Professions; Technological forecasting; future prospect; technological change; technological development",,,,,"Grupp, H., National foresight projects (1999) Technol.

Rather, at least partially, such learning is likely to occur in the course of action. The article also proposes that external pressure can set motion, but it alone does not lead to an environmental paradigm shift. In order to undergo such a shift, organizations will have to learn a meaning of their own to support new, more environmentally sound forms of activity. The present study examines empirically how two companies have learnt to incorporate environmental considerations into their managerial paradigms. It adopts a perspective according to which learning is portrayed as a process in which changes are brought about in the collective beliefs that the organization members hold about the relationship of their business to the natural environment (i.e. environmental management paradigm). Applying the grounded theory approach, the article identifies phases of environmental learning starting from the recognition or rejection of weak signals in 'pockets' of the organization, continuing through the gaining of new knowledge and experience towards 'competition' between old and new assumptions about the business-environment relationship, and finally proceeding to potential frame-break.",,,,,,,"Barrett, S., Murphy, D., The implications of the corporate environmental policy process for human resources management (1995) Greener Management International, 10, pp. 49-68; Bartunek, J., Changing interpretative schemes and organizational restructuring: The example of a religious order (1984) Administrative Science Quarterly, 29 (3), pp. 355-372; Bartunek, J., The dynamics of personal and organizational refraining (1988) Paradox and Transformation: Towards a Theory of Change in Organization and Management, pp. 137-162. , Quinn, R. and Cameron, K.

Together, these two elements explain the third, the massive inflow of foreign investments to the region. Many other dynamic regions do not have the same absolute advantages and their development is generated by hundreds of small local businesses and investments. We have therefore formulated a hypothesis to explain their dynamism in spite of their economic uncertainty and lack of absolute advantages. First, investors take advantage of different levels of complicity through networks that allow them to share and hence reduce uncertainty; and second, they increase their ability to innovate through the networks, which help them at least partially exceed their current innovative capacities. The networks - some of which are strong signal networks (usually regional) and others weak signal networks (regional or extra-regional) - promote the multiplication of fast growth SMEs which, in turn, stimulate the regional economy. We review the results of a case study (52 fast growth SMEs), high-lighting the importance of potential information and weak signal networks in generating fast growth for SMEs.","Endogenous development; Fast growth SMEs; Networks; Regional economy",,,,,,"Atkinson, R.D., Court, R.H., Ward, J.M., (1999) The State New Economy Index, , Washington, Progressive Policy Institute Technology & New Economy Project; Baldwin, J.R., (1995) L'innovation : La Clé de Réussite des Petites Entreprises, , Research Paper no. 76, Statistics Canada, Ottawa; Birley, S., Cromie, S., Myers, A., Entrepreneurial networks: Their emergence in Ireland and overseas (1995) International Small Business Journal, 9 (4); Crevoisier, O., (1993) Industrie et Région: Les Milieux Innovateurs de l'Arc Jurassien, , EDES, Neuchatel; De Bernardy, M., Boisgontier, P., (1988) Grains de Technopole, , Grenoble, Presses de l'U, de Grenoble; Genet, C., Quelles conditions pour la formation des biotechnopoles : Une analyse dynamique (1997) Revue d'Économie Régionale et Urbaine, (3); Gravonetter, M., The strength of weak ties: A network theory revisited (1982) Social Structure and Network Analysis, , P.V.

The classic management methods are often too late; problems already exist. The theory of weak signals presented by Igor Ansoff raises the question of whether corrresponding signals exist in the project management sector. The signals and messages are always more or less inaccurate, as indicated in the fuzzy theory. The research shows that stimuli (signals) which comply with the information theory can be found in the project environment. These signals change into information when they are received and interpreted. There are also messages which can be interpreted to be preliminary warning signals. The research analyses the character of the signals, their appearance, what project problems they are related to, and what their basic reasons are.

However, these lasers have often had problems of spectral purity due to a phenomenon known as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Recently, the development of higher-energy excimer and Nd:YAG pump lasers for dye lasers has enabled the detection of weaker signals in such applications as remote sensing. High-energy pump lasers tend to degrade the spectral purity of the dye-laser output, yet for many applications a high, quality, spectrally pure laser source is critical. A different approach to dye-laser oscillator design has addressed this problem. Specifically, this design eliminates most ASE. As a result, the spectral purity of the lasers that incorporate this oscillator is more than an order of magnitude better than that from any previous design.",,"Bandwidth; Cavity resonators; Excimer lasers; Infrared radiation; Laser beams; Laser pulses; Light emission; Optical design; Performance; Pumping (laser); Amplified spontaneous emission; Optical layout; Oscillator design; Pulsed dye lasers; Pulsewidth; Dye lasers",,,,,,"Bernstein, Jeffrey; Lambda Physik, Acton, United States",,,"PennWell Publ Co, Tulsa, OK, United States",,,,,07402511,,LFWOE,,"English","Laser Focus World",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029368679

Some of the most important events of the last 2 years, particularly the political upheavals in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, caught most observers off guard-even knowledgeable ones. In the oil industry, experts have sometimes been able to suggest, but rarely to predict, the key turning points in crude oil prices. Time after time, events that are considered improbable or even implausible occur. The future is too important to be ignored, notwithstanding this difficulty. The Shell approach to strategic planning is, instead of forecasts, to use scenarios, a set of 'stories' about alternative possible futures. These stories promote a discussion of possibilities other than the 'most likely' one and encourage the consideration of 'what if' questions. Although scenarios deal with the future, they are essentially a way of structuring the overwhelming, confusing information we have about the present. One of the important uses for this structure is to help us recognize more of what is going on around us, including the early, weak signals of change. Good scenarios are challenging, plausible and internally consistent. They also illuminate the uncertainties and issues that are critical for the future (in the case of this paper, for the future of the energy industry to the year 2010). Scenarios lead to better decisions if they improve our understanding of the world. This paper outlines two scenarios prepared in the Group Planning Coordination of Shell International Petroleum Company. Two notes are important. First, the author has summarized a much larger body of work to which approximately twenty members of Group Planning contributed, under the leadership of Kees van der Heijden. Second, this work was completed in the summer of 1989 and so, naturally, were we to re-formulate the scenarios now, our assessments in many areas would be very different. The value of this paper is therefore less in the content of the scenarios than in the particular approach to thinking about the future. © 1992.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00246301,,,,"English","Long Range Plann.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249008357

The nature of ISDTs is articulated using Dubin's concept of theory building and Simon's idea of a science of the artificial. An example of an ISDT is presented in the context of Executive Information Systems (EIS). Despite the increasing awareness of the potential of EIS for enhancing executive strategic decisionmaking effectiveness, there exists little theoretical work which directly guides EIS design. We contend that the underlying theoretical basis of EIS can be addressed through a design theory of vigilant information systems. Vigilance denotes the ability of an information system to help an executive remain alertly watchful for weak signals and discontinuities in the organizational environment relevant to emerging strategic threats and opportunities. Research on managerial information scanning and emerging issue tracking as well as theories of open loop control are synthesized to generate vigilant information system design theory propositions. Transformation of the propositions into testable empirical hypotheses is discussed. Copyright © 1992.

These Descriptors are visible in the form of weak signals. The authors link the impact of these Descriptors on the long-range planning system of a company through a set of Environmental Indicators and their Influence Diagrams. The process of monitoring is carried out by a group of managers who act as Environmental Radars. The role of Radars is to monitor the Descriptors, intercept and amplify the weak signals using an Environmental Data Base and generate the Environmental Scenarios. The system works on a continuous basis and assists top management in defining the size and direction of strategies and programmes for achieving long-range objectives. © 1987.",,"ECONOMICS - Management; SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND CYBERNETICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING; LONG-RANGE PLANNING; INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT",,,,,"King, Cleland, (1978) Strategic Planning and Policy, , Van Nostrand Reinhold, Scarborough, U.S.A; Ramachandran, Kumar, Narchal, Corporate planning practices in Indian public sector enterprises—a state of art (1982) Proceedings of National Seminar on Corporate Strategic Planning; Fahey, King, Narayanan, Environmental scanning and forecasting in strategic planning—the state of the art (1981) Long Range Planning, 14, pp. 32-39; Hussey, (1982) Corporate Planning: Theory and Practice, , Pergamon Press, Oxford; Reinhardt, Early warning systems for strategic planning (1984) Long Range Planning, 17, pp. 25-34; Steiner, (1979) Strategic Planning, , Free Press, New York; Dixit, Environmental scanning for corporate planning (1984) Productivity, 25, pp. 217-229; Seth, Environmental factors and strategic planning (1984) Productivity, 25, pp. 231-242","Narchal, R.M.; National Productivity CouncilIndia",,,,,,,,00246301,,,,"English","Long Range Plann.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023570550

In response to the first difficulty, the author develops a technique for early identification of early strategic signals and a method for matching the firm's response to the quality of information. In response to the second problem, a real time planning system, called strategic issue management, is developed. © 1975, The Regents of the University of California.

Key element of the lock-in is the mixer, which operates as a phase-sensitive switch. The switch position depends on the polarity of the reference square-wave drive, so that the input signal is commutated at the reference frequency. When the signal is not synchronized with the reference, as in the case of noise, the average (dc) level of the mixer output is zero. The lock-in amplifier can be used to measure weak distortion components in the presence of obscuring background noise, and to measure directly the distortion of a linear system without concern for the spectral purity of the excitation sources.",,"Amplifiers",,,,,,"Letzter, Seymour G.",,,,,,,,00134872,,ELODA,,,"Electron Des",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016113962
