However, the process through which such sustainable rejuvenation can be planned and pursued has been largely overlooked. In addition, available research about sustainable rejuvenation usually applies the triple bottom line framework while neglecting the fourth dimension of sustainability, time. The purpose of this study was to understand the motivations and perceptions of tourists regarding the sustainability of Sirmione (a tourism destination on Lake Garda, Italy) and to discuss the results with Sirmione's stakeholders and decision planners to identify priority interventions for sustainable rejuvenation. In recent times, Sirmione has undergone significant changes (related, for example, to the type of incoming tourists) and even if it is still ‘successful’, planners have started reflecting on the need for the town's rejuvenation. This study was approached through the two-tiered sustainability equilibria framework, which suggests a dynamic view of sustainability combining economic, environmental and social aspects with short-, long- and longer-term views. The study was based on data collected through a survey of 328 visitors to Sirmione and analysed through both descriptive statistics and contents analysis. The results of the survey served as the input for the subsequent collective learning process with local tourism operators. Through this process, Sirmione's destination planners were able to intercept weak signals about the evolution of visitor demand and competition. As a result, they developed a list of five priority interventions to implement through a strategic plan for rejuvenation while the destination is still successful. Embedded in the strategic plan were the two tiers of sustainability—economic, environmental and social, and short-, long- and longer-term perspectives. The results of this study contribute to highlighting the relevance of considering time (in addition to economic, social and environmental aspects) to explain the sustainable rejuvenation of a mature tourism destination. In addition, the study provides suggestions on the role of a destination's public and private actors to adopt a combination of initiatives to pursue sustainable rejuvenation. © 2019","Destination management; Longitudinal perspective; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainable development; Tourism destination; Visitor satisfaction","Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Endocrinology; Social aspects; Strategic planning; Surveys; Collective learning; Descriptive statistics; Longitudinal perspective; Social and environmental; Sustainability dimensions; Tourism destination; Tourist destinations; Visitor satisfaction; Sustainable development",,,,,"Agarwal, S., Restructuring seaside tourism: the resort lifecyle (2002) Ann.

This paper explores the process that outperforming managers used to detect and interpret weak signals. Interviews with 13 top-managers were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to allow the process to emerge. The findings confirmed earlier conclusions on perceptual filters that reduce the number and type of signals assessed. Contrary to earlier findings, the process was significantly altered to compensate for this loss in two ways. First, managers deliberately postponed their assessment of a weak signal by discussing it with people with distinct and second, some managers deliberately searched for signals that were unfamiliar and not fitting their mental model. The sample consisted of outperforming top managers, which raised questions about the generalizability of the findings in specific directions: are the alterations in the weak signal process exemplary for outperformers only, and how does its success compare to formal foresight methods. Finally, the findings have managerial relevance since they indicate how to detect and bring weak signals into the company before impact. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging change; Perception; Perceptual filter; Top manager; Weak signal",,,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., Scanning the business environment (1967), Macmillan New York; Anderson, M.H., Nichols, M.L., Information gathering and changes in threat and opportunity perceptions (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44 (3), pp. 367-387; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (000002), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic management (1979), Palgrave Macmillan UK London; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issue management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1 (2), pp. 131-148; Ansoff, H.I., Sullivan, P.A., Optimizing profitability in turbulent environments: A formula for strategic success (1993) Long Range Planning, 26 (5), pp. 11-23; Auster, E., Choo, C.W., Environmental scanning by CEO's in two Canadian industries (1993) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 44 (4), pp. 194-203; Auster, E., Choo, C.W., How senior managers acquire and use information in environmental scanning (1994) Information Processing & Management, 30 (5), pp. 607-618; Battistella, C., De Toni, A.F., A methodology of technological foresight: A proposal and field study (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (6), pp. 1029-1048; Beal, R.M., Competing effectively: Environmental scanning, competitive strategy, and organizational performance in small manufacturing firms (2000) Journal of Small Business Management, 38 (1), p. 27; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: Designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Association for information systems proceeding of the americas conference on information systems, , J.N.D.

Surprising events can be avoided by methods for monitoring and analyzing these signals, continually. These methods enable the detection process of potential threats and opportunities that may arise from those surprising events. While this strategic process is very useful, conventional methods for WS monitoring and analysis do not avoid cognitive and motivational problems that can harm the competitive intelligence capacity of organizations. The solution of these problems can be related to methods that allow conducting the detection process collectively, quickly and with the least effort, through the eventual support of automatic tools. Ontologies, for example, are computational artifacts that represent organizational knowledge whose features can be used in a conceptual system for classification of WS. The purpose of this work is to present such system, which also uses Web crawling, competitive forces and PESTLE analysis in the detection of threats and opportunities. A case example also is discussed showing that this approach can be used as a viable alternative to support surveillance of strategic discontinuities that permeate the organizational environment. © 2018","Competitive intelligence; Conceptual system; Knowledge representation; Strategic discontinuities; Weak signal","conceptual framework; detection method; knowledge; signal; strategic approach; World Wide Web",,,,,"Almeida, F., Hirata, P., Entendendo e implantando um sistema de inteligência competitiva (2016) REGE - Revista de Gestão, 23 (2), pp. 111-122; Ansoff, H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H., From strategic planning to strategic management (1976), John Wiley & Sons Inc.

Moreover, Reduce of Quality (RoQ) attack is a special DoS attack type. The RoQ attack is a potential DoS attack, it is simulator to normal traffic,so it is difficult to be detected by traditional detection method. Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT) time–frequency analysis method can be used to analyze the non-linear signal generated by RoQ attack. However, mode mixing and false component are the challenge problems to analyze the RoQ attack by HHT method. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method is used to eliminate the mode mixing problem. Correlated coefficient method is used to recognize the false components. In this paper, EEMD and correlated coefficient methods are combined to detect the weak signal generated by RoQ attack. Ad Hoc On-demand Multi-path Distance Vector routing protocol and random Routing REQuest flooding attack are simulated to implement RoQ attack in wireless sensor network by Network Simulator. Suitable white noises are added to original signal to detect the weak RoQ attack signal. Experiment results show that the improved HHT methods are highly effective to detect RoQ attack, when the standard deviation of white noise is 0.01 and the number of ensemble is 80, the detection results is best. When the correlated coefficient of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is greater than 0.2, the IMFs can be used to analyze and detect RoQ attack. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative experiment and method research on the routing-layer RoQ attack detection in WSN. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","AOMDV;

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based WPCN (U-WPCN) can effectively solve the problems of energy shortage and weak signal strength for ground terminals in remote areas. To establish a highly efficient U-WPCN, the service area for each UAV platform should be determined such that each UAV platform will hover at the optimal position according to the locations of the ground terminals in its group. Through hovering position optimization, this paper proposes two networking strategies for improving networking efficiency and maximizing communication performance. A greedy algorithm is used to find the optimal hovering point for each area; thus, the hovering points of all UAVs in the U-WPCN are finally obtained. Simulation results show that the UAV utilization efficiency can be significantly increased through the economical mode, and the terminal transmission rates can be improved for a given number of drones in the performance mode. © 2013 IEEE.","optimal placement; sustainable communication; Unmanned aerial vehicle; wirelessly powered communication network","Antennas; Drones; Energy conservation; Energy transfer; Optimization; Telecommunication networks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication performance; Greedy algorithms; Optimal placements; Sustainable energy supply; Transmission rates; Utilization efficiency; Wireless communications; Wireless power transfer; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,"You, X., Wang, J., Zhang, P., Research and thinking on green wireless mobile communication technology (2009) Univ.

The over-sampling technology is a method for increasing the accuracy, equal to the accuracy of high resolution ADCs, when an ADC has low resolution. For high resolution ADCs, their accuracy from the over-sampling technology would break its maximum limitation. During our signal collection, there are two items which affect our results: 1. measurement error; 2. non-linear characteristics at the end points. In over-sampling method of detecting weak signal of wearable devices by using the unidirectional saw-tooth shaped function, the magnitude of the shaped function is as close as possible to the integer multiple of the quantization step size to reduce the additional measurement error. To reduce the difficulty of the adding shaped function, which features nonlinearity of the starting point, a new method of detecting the weak signal by adding the bidirectional saw-tooth shaped function is proposed. The experimental results show this method is feasible for improving the ADC resolution. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bidirectional saw-tooth shaped function; Nonlinearity of the starting point; Over-sampling; Weak signal detection","Measurement errors; Quantization (signal); Signal sampling; Wearable technology; Analog-digital converter; Biological signals; Nonlinear characteristics; Nonlinearity of the starting point; Over sampling; Quantization step sizes; Saw-tooth; Weak signal detection; Signal detection",,,,,"Low Power, 2-Channel 24-Bit Sigma-Delta ADC (2017) Data Sheets, , http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD7787.pdf; Chen, M., Ma, Y.J., Li, Y., Wu, D., Zhang, Y., Youn, C.H., Wearable 2.0: Enable Human-Cloud Integration in Next Generation Healthcare System (2017) IEEE Communications, 55 (1), pp. 54-61; Chen, M., Shi, X., Zhang, Y., Wu, D., Guizani, M., Deep Features Learning for Medical Image Analysis with Convolutional Autoencoder Neural Network (2017) IEEE Transactions on Big Data, , https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2717439; Cheng, X., (2013) Design and Implementation of Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Based on Wireless, , Dissertation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Kim, J.M., Kwon, K.H., Recovery of finite missing samples in two-channel oversampling (2007) Sampling Theory in Signal and Image Processing, 6 (2), pp. 185-198; Li, G., Zhang, L., Weak Signal Detection Based on Over-Sampling and Saw-Tooth Shaped Function (2008) Acta Electron Sin, 36 (4), pp. 756-759; Li, H., Zhao, F., High Resolution and Wide Dynamic Range Infrasound Signal Acquisition System Based on Oversampling Techniques (2015) Intstrument Technique and Sensor, 5, pp. 62-64; Li, G., Liu, J., Li, X., A Multiple Biomedical Signals Synchronous Acquisition Circuit Based on Over-Sampling and Shaped Signal for the Application of the Ubiquitous Health Care (2014) Circuits Systems and Signal Processing, 33 (10), pp. 3003-3017; Xu, W., Wang, J., Chen, T., Application of oversampling technique in the design of FOG data collection (2007) Control & Measurement, 3, pp. 75-76; Zhang, Y., Chen, M., SOVCAN: Safety-Oriented Vehicular Controller Area Network (2017) IEEE Communications, 55 (8), pp. 94-99; Zhang, Y., Chen, M., Huang, D.J., Wu, D., Li, Y., iDoctor: Personalized and Professionalized Medical Recommendations Based on Hybrid Matrix Factorization (2017) Futur Gener Comput Syst, 66, pp. 30-35; Zhang, Y., Qiu, M.K., Tsai, C.W., Hassan, M.M., Alamri, A., Health-CPS: Healthcare Cyber-Physical System Assisted by Cloud and Big Data (2017) IEEE Syst J, 11 (1), pp. 88-95","Liu, H.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: hongliu@hust.edu.cn",,,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033474413

Unlike traditional normal text streams, these data present the characteristics of short length, weak signal, high volume, high velocity, topic drift, etc. Short text stream classification is hence a very challenging and significant task. However, this challenge has received little attention from the research community. Therefore, a new feature extension approach is proposed for short text stream classification with the help of a large-scale semantic network obtained from a Web corpus. It is built on an incremental ensemble classification model for efficiency. First, more semantic contexts based on the senses of terms in short texts are introduced to make up of the data sparsity using the open semantic network, in which all terms are disambiguated by their semantics to reduce the noise impact. Second, a concept cluster-based topic drifting detection method is proposed to effectively track hidden topic drifts. Finally, extensive studies demonstrate that as compared to several well-known concept drifting detection methods in data stream, our approach can detect topic drifts effectively, and it enables handling short text streams effectively while maintaining the efficiency as compared to several state-of-the-art short text classification approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","Classification; short text stream; topic drifting","Classification (of information); Efficiency; Noise pollution; Semantics; Detection methods; Ensemble classification; Feature extensions; Research communities; Short text classifications; Short texts; State of the art; topic drifting; Text processing",,,,,"Nigam, K., McCallum, A.K., Thrun, S., Mitchell, T., Text classification from labeled and unlabeled documents using em (2000) Mach.

Calibrating along multiple directions in the sky and removing the bright foreground signal is a crucial step in many science cases in radio interferometry. The residual data contain weak signals of huge scientific interest and of particular concern is the effect of incomplete sky models used in calibration on the residual. In order to study this, we consider the mapping between the input uncalibrated data and the output residual data. We derive an analytical relationship between the input and output probability density functions which can be used to study the performance of calibration. © 2018 IEEE.","Calibration; Interferometry; Radio interferometry","Array processing; Calibration; Interferometers; Interferometry; Computationally efficient; Distributed calibration; Input and outputs; Interferometric calibration; Performance analysis; Radio interferometers; Radio interferometry; Residual datum; Probability density function",,,,,"Zaroubi, S., The epoch of reionization (2013) The First Galaxies, Ser.

The significant challenges arise when the operating standards use overlapping frequency bands. Co-channel interference (CCI) is one of such challenges which have been in focus of the cellular communication community, but not in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) radio bands where multiple heterogeneous wireless standards operate without a centralized coordination. Recognizing Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) as one of the proven mechanisms to mitigate CCI, we propose methods to improve Packet Error Rate (PER) of wideband OFDM-based systems in the presence of multiple cochannel narrowband interferers. Our methods achieve improvements in PER statistics at lower received power level compared to conventional methods. Reduction in PER of the dominant OFDM signal makes more packets available for regeneration and hence cancellation during SIC procedure which aides the decoding of weaker signal. We also propose a simple yet efficient method to detect the presence and positioning of multiple narrowband interferers. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations show that our methods elevate a receiver sensitivity gain up to 6 dB and are capable of detecting multiple narrowband interferers simultaneously. Our methods require modifications in the physical layer of the receiver only and hence can be integrated into existing infrastructure. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Cochannel interference; Decoding; Europium compounds; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Network layers; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Software radio; Cochannel interference (CCI); Communication community; Conventional methods; Narrowband interferers; Received Power Levels; Receiver sensitivity; Software-defined radios; Successive interference cancellation(SIC); Nitrogen compounds",,,,,"github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11, Bastibl/Gr-ieee802-11.

The bibliometric analysis is based on “Tools for Innovation Monitoring” (TIM), a new software code developed by the Joint Research Centre. With this text-mining software a set of relevant keywords is extracted through frequency analysis from a corpus of pertinent scientific publications. Keywords obtained by quantitative analysis by TIM are tested against results from qualitative cognitive analysis by an international panel of PV technology experts by means of a set of proposed indicators. The technologies identified by the PV experts are well represented amongst the most frequently occurring (highest ranked) keywords retrieved by TIM. The more salient keywords tend to correspond to the relatively more established technologies such as dye sensitised solar cells, organic PV and more recently-developed technologies such as perovskites. These high rated/developed keywords/technologies can be relatively straightforwardly detected through bibliometric analysis. Contrary to that, keywords designating the most emerging technologies like ferroelectric PV, hot carriers and multiple exciton generation solar cells tend to occur much less frequently and therefore provide weaker signals. These weak signals can be important in foresight. © 2018 The Authors","Bibliometrics; Emerging technologies; Horizon scanning; Photovoltaics; Policy support; Technology mining","Data mining; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Excitons; Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; Solar power generation; Bibliometrics; Emerging technologies; Horizon scanning; Photovoltaics; Policy support; Solar cells",,,,,"European Commission, Communication from the commission to the European parliament, the council, the European economic and social committee and the committee of the regions (2017) Build.

Smart factories need to develop effective managerial early warning systems to identify and respond to subtle threats or opportunities, i.e. weak signals, in order to adapt to an ever-changing environment in a timely manner and thus gain or maintain a competitive advantage on the market. These factories need to develop and implement a several-stage early warning system that is specific to their industry. The aim of our study is, with the help of semi-structured group interviews, to examine which stages of a managerial early warning system are present in the case of a global innovative supplier in the automotive industry. As such, a four-stage managerial early warning system model for a knowledge-based automotive smart factory is proposed, in which aggregate activities and management decision-making strategies are defined for each stage, with the importance of intuition being taken into consideration. We found that managers rely on intuition and extensive analysis for satisficing strategies and teamwork for optimizing strategies, when using their managerial early warning system. © 2018, Editura Cefin.","Best practice;

To this day, many papers on this topic have been published. However, research so far has only dealt with specific aspects, but it has failed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research domain. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to organize existing insights and knowledge. The 91 relevant papers, published between 1997 and 2017, are analyzed for their distribution over time and research outlets. Classifying them by their distinct properties, we study the data sources exploited and the data mining techniques applied. We also consider eight different purposes of analysis, namely weak signals and trends concerning political, economic, social and technological factors. The results of our systematic review show that the research domain has indeed been attracting growing attention over time. Furthermore, we observe a great variety of data mining and visualization techniques, and present insights on the efficacy and effectiveness of the data mining techniques applied. Our results reveal that a stronger emphasis on search strategies, data quality and automation is required to greatly reduce the human actor bias in the early stages of the corporate foresight process, thus supporting human experts more effectively in later stages such as strategic decision making and implementation. Moreover, systems for detecting weak signals and trends need to be able to learn and accumulate knowledge over time, attaining a holistic view on weak signals and trends, and incorporating multiple source types to provide a solid foundation for strategic decision making. The findings presented in this paper point to future research opportunities, and they can help practitioners decide which sources to exploit and which data mining techniques to apply when trying to detect weak signals and trends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Big data;

However, it is an under-researched area within the context of smart factories. For the purpose of the study, semi-structured group interviews were used to investigate how managers at a smart factory, a highly innovative global supplier in the automotive industry sense weak signals, perceive the role of intuition, smart systems and business model adjustments. The results of the study show that managers perceive early warning systems as highly important for timely response to development changes and that both smart systems and intuition play an essential role in detecting and responding to weak signals. Based on this study, we propose a managerial early warning system model with four stages, namely, identifying, screening, appraising and responding to weak signs, within the context of a smart factory. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","behavioral economics;

It includes three operation procedures: synthesis of dual-wavelength quantum dot, fluorescence excitation and acquisition of weak signal and signal conditioning. Based on the quenching principle of Cu2+ on quantum dot fluorescence, dual-wavelength quantum dot fluorescent probe can get lower limitation of detection. In addition, to improve the accuracy of testing results, two-channel detection was developed for avoiding interference. Experiment results demonstrate that the limitation for detection of trace Cu2+ in paddy water is 1.4 nM. The relationship between the Cu2+ concentration (x) and the ratio variation of dual wavelength (y) is y = 2.15 × exp(x/5.862) − 1.154 with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.997 and the detection time of 4 min. Meanwhile, compared to other heavy metal ions, nutrient and organic compounds, the presented detector is of good selectivity for Cu2+ in paddy water. The repetitive detection experiments show that the developed device has high repeatability with relative standard deviation of 0.14%. The device can be used for quick and accurate detection of trace Cu2+ residues in paddy water with some specific advantages of high sensitivity, excellent selectivity and high repeatability. © 2018, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Dual-wavelength quantum dot fluorescence probe;

One solution is semantic hashing which designs binary codes to accelerate similarity search. Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to the semantic hashing problem and produces high-quality compact binary codes compared to traditional methods. However, most state-of-the-art semantic hashing approaches require large amounts of hand-labeled training data which are often expensive and time consuming to collect. The cost of getting labeled data is the key bottleneck in deploying these hashing methods. Motivated by the recent success in machine learning that makes use of weak supervision, we employ unsupervised ranking methods such as BM25 to extract weak signals from training data. We further introduce two deep generative semantic hashing models to leverage weak signals for text hashing. The experimental results on four public datasets show that our models can generate high-quality binary codes without using hand-labeled training data and significantly outperform the competitive unsupervised semantic hashing baselines. © 2018 ACM.","Semantic hashing; Variational autoencoder; Weak supervision","Binary codes; Deep learning; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Semantics; Signal processing; Auto encoders; Critical component; Labeled training data; Large scale information retrieval; Ranking methods; Similarity search; State of the art; Weak supervision; Search engines",,,,,"Salakhutdinov, R., Hinton, G., Semantic hashing (2009) International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 50 (7), pp. 969-978; Wang, J., Liu, W., Kumar, S., Chang, S., Learning to hash for indexing big data- A survey (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE, 104 (1), pp. 34-57; Chaidaroon, S., Fang, Y., Variational deep semantic hashing for text documents (2017) SIGIR; Robertson, S., Zaragoza, H., The probabilistic relevance framework: Bm25 and beyond (2009) Foundations and TrendsR in Information Retrieval, 3 (4), pp. 333-389; Kingma, D., Welling, M., Auto-encoding variational bayes (2014) ICLR; Wang, J., Zhang, T., Song, J., Sebe, N., Tao Shen, H., A survey on learning to hash (2017) PAMI; Zhang, D., Wang, J., Cai, D., Lu, J., Self-taught hashing for fast similarity search (2010) SIGIR; Dehghani, M., Zamani, H., Severyn, A., Kamps, J., Bruce Croft, W., Neural ranking models with weak supervision (2017) SIGIR; Lv, Y., Zhai, C., A comparative study of methods for estimating query language models with pseudo feedback (2009) CIKM; Weiss, Y., Torralba, A., Fergus, R., Spectral hashing (2009) NIPS; Zhang, D., Wang, J., Cai, D., Lu, J., Laplacian co-hashing of terms and documents (2010) ECIR; Datar, M., Immorlica, N., Indyk, P., Mirrokni, V.S., Localitysensitive hashing scheme based on p-stable distributions (2004) SoCG; Liu, W., Wang, J., Ji, R., Jiang, Y., Chang, S., Supervised hashing with kernels (2012) CVPR; Wang, Q., Zhang, D., Si, L., Semantic hashing using tags and topic modeling (2013) SIGIR",,,"ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","41st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2018","8 July 2018 through 12 July 2018",,138121,,9781450356572,,,"English","Int.

This article used a hybrid methodology to identify and learn from the pioneers of renewable energy around the world. First, weak signals and emerging issues were identified to craft socio-cultural scenarios, which describe how societies could change, while adopting high shares of renewable energy. Four transformative scenarios ""Radical Startups"", ""Value-Driven Techemoths"", ""Green Do-It- Yourself Engineers"" and ""New Consciousness"" until the year 2050 were constructed. Pioneer analysis was then used to identify scenario-relevant pioneers in case study countries. The findings of an international expert survey describe present pioneers who are leading ecological lifestyles and the adoption of renewable energy technologies. The findings can be used to think of leverage points for systemic change. The article finds pioneer analysis as a useful method to obtain foresight knowledge of anticipated transformations. © 2018 Journal of Futures Studies.","Pioneer analysis; Renewable energy; Scenario; Solar; Transformation; Weak signals; Wind",,,,,,"Abson, D.J., Fischer, J., Leventon, J., Newig, J., Schomerus, T., Vilsmaier, U., Leverage points for sustainability transformation (2016) Ambio: A Journal of the Human Environment, 46 (1), pp. 30-39; Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, 46, pp. 23-40; Barasa, M., Bogdanov, D., Ayobami, S.O., Breyer, C., A cost optimal resolution for Sub-Saharan Africa powered by 100% renewables in 2030 (2018) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 92, pp. 440-457. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.110; Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of Futures Studies, 1. , Human Science for a New Era.

However, despite their inherent advantages (e.g., increasing the flexibility of supply chains), feedforward controls remain underdeveloped in the pharmaceutical distribution sector, largely due to the tediousness of identifying applicable anticipatory indicators. To properly anticipate the achievement of business objectives, in our in-depth case study of a Swiss wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products we relied on the notion of weak signals as conceptualized by Ansoff to develop a conceptual framework of feedforward. We identified a weak signal that showed more occurrences of error when less versatile employees were involved in executing tasks. The standard operating procedure for customer complaint management was recently adapted to include a feedforward control based on the weak signal. © 2018 IEEE.","error occurrence; feedforward control;

To accurately capture satellite drift signals, a satellite signal feed array module structure is proposed, and optimal radius is obtained. A precise antenna positioning control algorithm is also proposed for automatic compensation for tracking and receiving satellite signals. Tracking precision of synchronous satellite is thus improved remarkably. Therefore, a high precision receiving device for synchronous satellite remote sensing weak signal is developed. Its application shows that the system time resolution is 10 minutes, its monitoring range is wide. In order to realize accurate identification of fire spots from synchronous satellite weak signals and rapid location by towers, a dynamic threshold fire spot identification method and an improved algorithm for wildfire location by tower are proposed. Application shows that fire spot identification accuracy and tower positioning speed is high. It means that the device and above-mentioned algorithm are fully applicable to wide area monitoring of overhead transmission line wildfire. © 2018, Power System Technology Press.

To ensure its reliability, key power grid components such as transformers are extensively monitored for signs of failures and errors. This work concentrates on a type of event known as the partial discharge (PD) because it is the symptom of insulation weakness, the most common cause of transformer failures. More specifically, our work is to locate the position of a partial discharge to provide information for preventive maintenance. Our method utilizes the information from a set of ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensors inside the transformer, and proceeds in two steps: first determine the signal arrival time and then locate the position based on time differences. To determine the arrival time, we develop a convolutional filtering method based on the Savitzky-Golay filter. To provide accurate locations, we simulate the electromagnetic wave propagation using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) to generate a reference table of the travel time from each FDTD mesh point to the sensors. We exercise our method using two sets of UHF measurements with different signal to noise ratios. In both cases, our method provides more accurate locations than other methods. The difference is particularly prominent when the signal is weak. With weak signals, the best existing method, the cumulative energy method, was only able to predict the PD location within 300 mm of the known sources in 13% of the test cases, while our method is correct in 48% of the test cases. © 2017 IEEE.","FDTD methods;

Accessed 5 Aug 2017] predicted that the world would face the Fourth Industrial Revolution which means innovative changes through convergence of cutting-edge information and communications technologies (ICTs) such as artificial intelligence, IoT, big data and cloud computing with conventional industries. It was forecasted that such innovation would take place across all industries and services. In particular, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has paid attention to changes in conventional traditional industries. The weak signal analysis is a method which can detect the sign of future changes at an early stage. A weak signal is defined as an advanced indicator in such changes. Therefore, its search and monitoring can be an early warning on threat and great opportunity to be prepared. To overcome the limitation of future prediction which is mostly dependent upon an expert group's intuitive judgment, this study attempted to investigate the weak signal of convergence among industries, using knowledge structure based approaches. As new products and services can lead to convergence between industries, research data has gathered information on the products and services of global listed companies which have been established for the past 11 years. For comparative analysis, they were grouped every 5 years, and product and service trends were compared. And we detected weak signals of convergence with different industries and noticed the changes of existing industries. Historically, the convergence of industries is mainly discussed in relation to science and technology-led industries, so the industrial field that has been studied has chosen Korea's growth engine industries, a high-tech science and technology industries. © The Author(s).","Convergence trend; Global listed companies; Growth engine industry; Sharing economy; Weak signal",,,,,,"(2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/InnovationStrategy.pdf, The White House.

In the future studies, the identification of future signal is one of the renowned techniques for analysis of trends, emerging issue, and gaining future insights. In the Big Data era, recent scholars have proposed using a text mining procedure focusing upon web data such as new social media and academic papers. However, the detection of future signals is still under a developing area of research, and there is much to improve existing methodology as well as developing theoretical foundations. The present study reviews previous literature on identifying emerging issue based on the weak signal detection approach. Then the authors proposed a revised framework that incorporate quantitative and qualitative text mining for assessing the strength of future signals. The authors applied the framework to the case study on the ethical issues of artificial intelligence (hereafter AI). From EBSCO host database, the authors collected text data covering the ethical issues in AI and conducted text mining analysis. Results reveal that emerging ethical issues can be classified as strong signal, weak signal, well-known but not so strong signal, and latent signal. The revised methodology will be able to provide insights for government and business stakeholders by identifying the future signals and their meanings in various fields. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Data-driven foresight; Ethical issue; Future signal; Text mining",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

It is based on the ontology of a technology/market trend, Hype Cycles methodology, and semantic indicators which provide evidence of a maturity level of a technology as well as of emerging user needs (customer pains) in high-tech industries. This approach forms the basis for text mining software tools implemented in Semantic Hub platform. The algorithms behind these tools allow users to escape from getting too general or garbage results which make it impossible to identify promising technologies at early stages (early detection, weak signals). Besides, these algorithms provide high-quality results in the extraction of complex multiword terms which correspond to technological concepts and user pains forming a trend. The methodology and software developed as a result of this study are applicable to various industries with minor adjustments. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

The author defines innovations as ongoing processes of changes in the various fields of social and economic life, which result from human creative activity. Noting that innovation is an uncertain, relatively chaotic, and disordered process characterized by inherent risks, the author aims to define the most general and universal barriers impeding one's ability to recognize the signs of future innovation and to anticipate their consequences. Considering examples of ""disruptive innovation"" in the technological, social, political, and economic spheres of life, the author sees these innovations as arising from certain condition and events, not as simple random occurrences. Most of them are effects of particular causes. However, these causes are often hidden within events that are difficult to observe and phenomena encapsulated in weak signals. The inability to detect and recognize such pre-emerging warnings of upcoming innovations may be attributed to the massive amount of information and noise flooding today's world. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of knowledge, techniques, and experience for dealing with huge amounts of information, the lack of the required skills, and, finally, by human cognitive biases. Faced with this deluge of misinformation, any person can eventually be misled and make mistakes. This paper posits that, in order to mitigate such risks, an individual must avoid the three cognitive biases: the symmetry of delusions, aggressive neglect, and the curse of knowledge. These cognitive biases are the barriers to foreseeing innovation. © 2018 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

In this paper, the applicability of weak signals and wild cards is experimented in a case of a highly reliable and conservative sector, water and sanitation services. The aim is to explore an approach suitable for water utilities. The paper discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches to weak signals and wild cards, and reflects these in relation to the chosen approach. It is argued that the process of weak signals and wild cards can serve as a communication and reflection exercise for an organisation like a water utility. Furthermore, incorporating weak signals and wild cards can be an essential part in futures thinking, challenge prevailing mental models, and make systems more open to sense and learn from their environment. It is recommended for water utilities to apply a loose approach on weak signals and wild cards and embed it as a part of their organisational culture. However, it should be remembered that the approach should always be chosen to match the overall objectives and context. © 2017, The Author(s).","Water and sanitation services; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Hiltunen, E., (2010) Weak signals in organizational futures learning, , Aalto University School of Economics, Dissertation; Miller, R., Rossel, P., Jorgensen, U., Future studies and weak signals: a critical survey (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 195-197; Holopainen, M., Toivonen, M., Weak signals: Ansoff today (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 198-205; Mendonça, S., Cardoso, G., Caraça, J., The strategic strength of weak signal analysis (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 218-228; Rossel, P., Early detection, warnings, weak signals and seeds of change: a turbulent domain of futures studies (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 229-239; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The big picture – trends, drivers, wild cards, discontinuities and weak signals (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 292-312; Cevolini, A., The strongness of weak signals: self-reference and paradox in anticipatory systems (2016) Eur J Futures res, 4, pp. 1-13; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Slaughter, R.A., A new framework for environmental scanning (1999) Foresight, 1, pp. 441-451; Popper, R., Foresight methodology (2008) The Handbook of technology foresight: concepts and practice, pp. 44-88. , Georghiou L, Harper JC, Keenan M, Miles I, Popper R, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision making (2009) Technol Anal Strateg, 21, pp. 307-320; Pieper, K.J., Tang, M., Edwards, M.A., Flint water crisis caused by interrupted corrosion control: investigating ""ground zero"" home (2017) Environmental Science & Technology, 51, p. 2007; Saritas, O., Proskuryakova, L., Water resources – an analysis of trends, weak signals and wild cards with implications for Russia (2017) Foresight, 19, pp. 152-173; Nafday, A.M., Strategies for managing the consequences of black swan events (2009) Leader Manag Eng, 9, pp. 191-197; Kahneman, D., (2011) Thinking, fast and slow, , Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York; Taleb, N.N., (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, , Random House, New York; Heino, O.A., Takala, A.J., Katko, T.S., Challenges to Finnish water and wastewater services in the next 20–30 years (2011) E-Water, 1, pp. 1-20; Dominguez, D., (2008) Handling future uncertainty - strategic planning for the infrastructure sector, , Dissertation, ETH Zurich; Meadows, D.H., Wright, D., (2008) Thinking in systems: a primer, , Chelsea Green, White River Junction; Rognerud, I., Fonseca, C., van der, K.A., Moriarty, P., (2016) IRC trends analysis, 2016–2025; Ravetz, J., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2011) ERA toolkit: applications of wild cards and weak signals to the grand challenges & thematic priorities of the European research area, , Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, University of Manchester; Swyngedouw, E., (2004) Social power and the urbanization of water: flows of power, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Castro, J.E., Systemic conditions and public policy in the water and sanitation sector (2009) Water and sanitation services, pp. 19-37. , Castro JE, Heller L, (eds), Earthscan, London; Slaughter, R.A., From forecasting and scenarios to social construction: changing methodological paradigms in futures studies (2002) Foresight, 4, pp. 26-31; Miles, I., Harper, J.C., Georghiou, L., Keenan, M., Popper, R., The many faces of foresight (2008) The Handbook of technology foresight: concepts and practice, pp. 3-23. , Georghiou L, Harper JC, Keenan M, Miles I, Popper R, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting strategic management, , Prentice/Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Könnölä, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., van Rij, V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39, pp. 208-221; Moijanen, M., Heikot signaalit tulevaisuuden tutkimuksessa.

Whereas previous research on the effect of bilateral investment treaties (BIT) on capital flows has focused almost exclusively on direct foreign investment (DFI), this article examines total flows of all types. It also asks a question ignored by previous studies: Do investment treaties affect the cost that a developing country must pay for the capital it receives? Instead of viewing investment treaties as just international legal instruments prescribing rights and duties, the article also examines their role as information to international capital markets. Relying on insights from the economics of information and signaling theory, it argues that investment treaties influence capital flows through the signals they send to international capital markets. Accordingly, it creates a model of a ""Strong BIT Signal Country"" and proceeds to identify twenty-six countries that fit the model, while identifying for comparative purposes fifteen countries deemed to be ""Weak Signal BIT Countries. ""An analysis of capital flows to both groups of countries finds that the Strong Signal BIT Countries experienced significant increased capital inflows following the completion of their BIT negotiation program and also reveals that they outperformed the Weak Signal BIT countries in this respect. Using data on sovereign credit ratings and World Bank governance indicators on the rule of law, the author also finds that several countries experienced an improvement in both indicators following the conclusion of their BIT programs, leading to the inference that such improvement might also be associated with a reduction in a country's risk premium and therefore a decline in its cost of capital.",,,,,,,"Salacuse, J.W., (2015) The Law of Investment Treaties, p. 3. , 2d ed; (2015) World Investment Report, p. 109. , UNCTAD; Sornarajah, M., An international investment court: Panacea or purgatory, No. 180 (2016) Columbia FDI Perspectives, p. 1. , http://ccsi.columbia.edu/fiIes/2013/10/No-180-Sornarajah-FINAL.pdf, Aug. 15; BG Grp.

The world is a complex system and the rapid change among its sub-systems builds up pressure for any efforts to anticipate change and shape the processes of transformation. Surprise is an intrinsic aspect of change, in particular when it takes place at an accelerating pace with high degrees of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity (VUCA) - or within the condition of post-normality as described by Ziauddin Sardar. Emerging technologies such as AI and renewable energy systems add to the complexity of societies, and thus to the world of VUCA and post-normality. In foresight horizon scanning has much focused on the probable or even predictable -surprise-free developments. More emphasis should be paid on systematic anticipation of wild cards and black swans, and on the analysis of weak signals. Foresight should also focus on discontinuities - broader phenomena and developments instead of single events. Energy is a complex issue. Without energy there is no life, neither biological nor economic. Taking into account the huge ecological and social costs of the present energy system, the need for a new emission-free, cost-effective, and democratised energy system is obvious. An energy transformation to reach 100% renewable energy is envisioned in four transformational neo-carbon energy scenarios. Energy is increasingly a societal and even cultural issue - above all a security issue. As regards energy security, various sudden events and surprises could play a major role. New energy systems themselves, with other new technologies, nudge the world into unknown, discontinuous directions. Therefore, we probe the resilience, anti-fragility and discontinuity of these transformational, societal energy scenarios. The results of a futures clinique where the scenarios were tested are presented. Implications of surprises for energy security, as the world increasingly seeks to move towards a renewable energy based society, are explored. © 2017, The Author(s).","Black swans; Complexity; Discontinuity; Energy security; Renewable energy; Resilience; Transformative scenarios; Turbulence; Uncertainty; Wild cards",,,,,,"Aven, T., Implications of black swans to the foundations and practice of risk assessment and management (2015) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 134, pp. 83-91; Aven, T., On the meaning of a black swan in a risk context (2013) Saf Sci, 57, pp. 44-51; Last, C., Human metasystem transition (HMST) theory (2015) J Evol Technol, 25 (1), pp. 1-16; Osti, G., Frames, organisations, and practices as social components of energy (2012) Int Rev Sociol, 22 (3), pp. 412-428; Lord, B., (2014) Art & Energy: how culture changes, , The AAM Press, Arlington; Naam, R., (2011) Smaller, cheaper, faster: Does Moore's law apply to solar cells?

This paper presents a visual analytics-based approach to assist an expert user in tracking topics relative to his/her company from Twitter. Developed for visualizing topic long-term evolution and detecting weak signals, our process is composed of three complementary steps: (i) a time-dependent topic extraction based on a Latent Dirichlet Allocation, (ii) a topic relationship detection based on a dissimilarity which evaluates the topic proximities between consecutive time slots, and (iii) a topic evolution visualization inspired by a Sankey diagram popular in industrial environments to show dynamic relationships in a system. To test our approach, we have used a real-life dataset from the French energy company EDF from which we have analyzed the evolution of a corpus of more than 70 000 tweets related to this company published over one year, and detected different types of evolving patterns hidden by the data volume and commonly masked by fully automatic mining algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Social media; Topic mining; Twitter; Visual analytics; Weak signals","Decision support systems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Signal detection; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Statistics; Visualization; Social media; Topic minings; Twitter; Visual analytics; Weak signals; Data mining",,,,,"Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M.M., Stahl, F., TRCM: A methodology for temporal analysis of evolving concepts in twitter (2013) Artificial intelligence and soft computing, pp. 135-145. , Springer; Ahlqvist, T., Bäck, A., Halonen, M., Heinonen, S., (2008), Social media roadmaps – exploring the futures triggered by social media, Tech. rep., VTT Tiedotteita – Research Notes 2454; Aigner, W., Miksch, S., Shuman, H., Tominsky, C., Visualization of time-oriented data (2011), Springer; Ajmera, J., Ahn, H., Nagarajan, M., Verma, A., Contractor, D., Dill, S., Denesuk, M., A CRM system for social media: Challenges and experiences.

The time horizon of planning is short-Term, the strategic way of thinking beyond 7-10 years long period is missing or it has great deficiencies. It is not even considering the long-Term opportunities. Therefore, the short term plans are not derived from established perspectives, they do not have sufficient grounds. This paper briefly summarises the achievements of a research activity to make an attempt to prove that despite the limitations in understanding and unfolding the future, it is possible to provide useful information for the planning of rural development in 20-30 years or even on several more years.

A DMPO-OH signal was observed below pH 3.0 in the presence of nitrite ions, whereas in the absence of nitrite ion, an extremely weak signal was observed below pH 1.5. Addition of methanol, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, to this system did not lead to the appearance of a detectable DMPO-CH2OH signal. The possibility of this DMPO-OH signal being due to a genuine spin trapping process with hydroxyl radical was, therefore, ruled out. The reactivities of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in this system with DMPO have also been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) at the IEFPCM (water)/B3LYP/6–311 + G ** level of theory. On the basis of the pH dependence of the signal intensity and the redox potential E° (versus SHE) calculated by DFT theory, we propose that the origin of this signal is “inverted spin trapping” via one-electron oxidation of DMPO by H2ONO+, followed by the nucleophilic addition of water. Prevention of these false-positive results when detecting hydroxyl radical using ESR spin trapping requires an awareness of both the presence of nitrite ions in the solution and the solution pH. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR); electron spin resonance; hydroxyl radical; RNS","5,5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline 1 oxide; acid; hydroxyl radical; methanol; nitrite; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide; amine oxide; hydrogen peroxide; ion; methanol; nitrite; scavenger; water; aqueous solution; Article; chelation; density functional theory; electron spin resonance; false positive result; nucleophilicity; oxidation reduction potential; pH; signal detection; chemistry; drug effect; oxidation reduction reaction; spin trapping; Cyclic N-Oxides; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Free Radical Scavengers; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydroxyl Radical; Ions; Methanol; Nitrites; Oxidation-Reduction; Reactive Nitrogen Species; Spin Trapping; Water",,"5,5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline 1 oxide, 3317-61-1; hydroxyl radical, 3352-57-6; methanol, 67-56-1; nitrite, 14797-65-0; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; water, 7732-18-5; 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide; Cyclic N-Oxides; Free Radical Scavengers; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydroxyl Radical; Ions; Methanol; Nitrites; Reactive Nitrogen Species; Water",,,"Janzen, E.G., Spin trapping (1971) Acc Chem Res, 4 (1), pp. 31-40; Finkelstein, E., Rosen, G.M., Rauckman, E.J., Spin trapping of superoxide and hydroxyl radical: practical aspects (1980) Arch Biochem Biophys, 200, pp. 1-16; Frejaville, C., Karoui, H., Tuccio, B., Le Moigne, F., Culcasi, M., Pietri, S., 5-(Diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide: a new efficient phosphorylated nitrone for the in vitro and in vivo spin trapping of oxygen-centered radicals (1995) J Med Chem, 38, pp. 258-265; Liu, K.J., Miyake, M., Panz, T., Swartz, H., Evaluation of DEPMPO as a spin trapping agent in biological systems (1999) Free Radic Biol Med, 26, pp. 714-721; Olive, G., Mercier, A., Le Moigne, F., Rockenbauer, A., Tordo, P., 2-Ethoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole-1-oxide: evaluation of the spin trapping properties (2000) Free Radic Biol Med, 28, pp. 403-408; Eberson, L., ‘Inverted spin trapping’ Reactions between the radical cation of α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone and ionic and neutral nucleophiles (1992) J Chem Soc Perkin Trans 2, pp. 1807-1813; Bhattacharjee, S., Khan, M.N., Chandra, H., Symons, M.C.R., Radical cations from nitrone spin-traps: reaction with water to give OH adducts (1996) J Chem Soc Perkin Trans 2, pp. 2631-2634; Chandra, H., Symons, M.C.R., Hydration of spin-trap cations as a source of hydroxyl adducts (1986) J Chem Soc Chem Commun, pp. 1301-1302; Eberson, L., Inverted spin trapping part III Further studies on the chemical and photochemical oxidation of spin traps in the presence of nucleophiles (1994) J Chem Soc Perkin Trans 2, pp. 171-176; Forrester, A.R., Hepburn, S.P., Spin traps.

According to the movement schools of thought, a strategy can be set from the inside out in which case the organization influences the surroundings with its offer of products and / or services. Given the importance of weak signals in the definition of the strategy, the research goal is to treat the issue of pre-emptive strategy in the context of strategic decision making. An answer is provided for the following questions: (1) What is a weak signal? (2) How to tell if it is anticipative, relevant and useful for the decision makers? and (3) How to turn a weak signal in an effective anticipative clue? Based on investigator's experience in strategic consulting for small, medium and large companies, the weak and strong signals are explained and a set of criteria which are representative of their identification is presented. © 2018 by IGI Global.

In order to achieve this goal, a multiple case-study strategy is employed which combines the qualitative with the quantitative perspective. The results prove that 78.10% of the variability of the managerial early warning system reliability can be explained by managers' influence and company's size; the first one is negatively correlated with system's reliability while the latest is positively correlated with system's reliability. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications. On the one hand, they extend the literature regarding managers' participation in the process of developing the future corporate strategy. On the other hand, they offer a better understanding on how managers may influence not only the identification of the weak signals but also the development of scenarios and forecasted business results. © 2018 by IGI Global.

This study proposes an approach to novelty-focused weak signal detection from online futuristic data. For this, first, text mining is applied to extract signals in the form of keywords from futuristic data. Second, a local outlier factor is utilized to assess the rarity and paradigm unrelatedness of signals. The futuristic data is considered a source of weak signals and patent data is utilized as a proxy for existing paradigms of technological innovation. Finally, signal-portfolio maps are developed to identify the patterns of signal representations. The proposed approach helps broaden the source of weak signals and improve the sensitivity to the detection of weak signals.

The process of locking on the satellites is quite costly and requires millions of hardware multiplications, leading to high power consumption. In order to reduce the GPS receivers cost, acquisition time and power consumption; the complexity of the acquisition process should be reduced. In this paper, A modified algorithm is proposed to reduce the complexity of the time parallel acquisition algorithm with transition detection (TPATD) by using the Sparse Fourier Transform. The acquisition process is considered to two signals-24 dB (weak signal) and-30 dB (very weak signal) in presence of data bit-sign transitions. The complexity of the proposed algorithms without losing the sensitivity will be O (Np+ N/p log N/p) for very weak signals and O (N/p log N/p) for weak signals where p is the down sampling factor. The reduction in complexity because of the proposed algorithm is calculated for the mentioned cases. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed algorithm with the receiver operative characteristic curves using Monte Carlo simulations. © 2017 IEEE.","Complexity reduction; GPS; ROC curves; Sparse Fourier transform; Transition detection","Electric power utilization; Fourier transforms; Intelligent systems; Locks (fasteners); Monte Carlo methods; Satellites; Signal sampling; Tracking (position); Characteristic curve; Complexity reduction; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Hardware multiplication; High power consumption; Parallel acquisition; ROC curves; Transition detection; Global positioning system",,,,,"(2008) Bernard Hofmann-Wellenhof, Herbert Lichtenegger and Elmar Wasle, 'Global Navigation Satellite Systems: GPS, GLONASS, , Galileo and More', Springer Wein New York; Jeffrey, C., (2015) An Introduction to Gnss: GPS, Glonass, Galileo and Other Global Navigation Satellite Systems, , P.

In the presentation special attention is paid to new available technologies, which help in the identification process. Author notes that disruptive technologies can be double-edged sword, as cyber terrorists can use the new disruptive technologies. Author first presents background theories of terrorist profiling and identification with special attention to geographical, behavioral, and sociological aspects. In the second phase, author evaluates the potential role of emerging radical and disruptive technologies in the identification process of individual terrorists and terrorist groups. Author also presents key systemic aspects of terrorism foresight paying special attention to advanced weak signal analysis and Wild Card methodology. WE-WI-analysis (weak signal-wild card analysis) can be helpful in operational risk identification, risk assessment, and risk mitigation. Author presents various models which are relevant for terrorism foresight. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

We chose the milk market as a case study, in line with the recent call from the EU Commission for governance tools which help to better address such highly volatile markets. Furthermore, on the first of April 2015, the new Common Agricultural Policy ended quotas for milk, which led to a milk crisis in the EU. Thus, we collaborated with milk experts to get their inputs for a new model to analyse the competitive environment. Consequently, we constructed graphs to represent the major factors that affect the milk industry and the relationships between them. We obtained several network measures for this social network, such as centrality and density. Some factors appear to have the largest major influence on all the other graph elements, while others strongly interact in cliques. Any detected changes in any of these factors will automatically impact the others. Therefore, scanning ones competitive environment can allow an organisation to get an early warning to help it avoid an issue (as much as possible) and/or seize an opportunity before its competitors. We conclude that Strategic Early Warning Systems as a corporate foresight approach utilising graph theory can strengthen the governance of markets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate foresight; Graph theory; Milk market; Scanning; Scenario analysis; Strategic Early Warning System","commodity market; corporate strategy; crisis management; early warning system; European Union; governance approach; graphical method; milk; scenario analysis; France",,,,,"Organizations make strides in adoption of analytics, but struggle to capitalize on investments.

This phenomenon, known as “convergence”, leads to emerging industry segments and offers a wide array of opportunities for synergies. Against this background, a significant emphasis has been put on anticipating technology convergence as well as identifying and understanding the changing innovation patterns and industry structure associated with convergence. The timely recognition of converging technological fields enables the innovating enterprises to exert a positive influence on the changing value-chain. This paper introduces a refined methodological approach for the anticipation of converging technology areas based on the concept of knowledge flow. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to the areas of Nutraceuticals and Functional Food (NFF), Nanotechnology and Wearables. Our results indicate that the emerging technology convergence can be expressed by the concept of “weak signals”. The indices derived from the proposed approach are capable of uncovering the relationships between the individual technological sectors and provide numerical metrics to measure the presence of converging technologies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Functional food; IPC co-classification; Knowledge flow; Patent analysis; Technological convergence; Wearables","Functional food; Technology transfer; Wearable technology; Converging technologies; Emerging technologies; Knowledge flow; Methodological approach; Patent analysis; Technological convergence; Technology convergence; Wearables; Patents and inventions; food industry; industrial structure; industrial technology; innovation; knowledge; property rights; technology adoption",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

Since spin noise arises from spin fluctuation at thermal equilibrium, it is a weak signal, therefore, various methods are used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the measurement system. To study the influence from different factors on the quality of spin noise spectroscopy, we report spin noise spectroscopy measurements in Rubidium vapor with three methods: a commercial frequency analyzer, a data acquisition card (DAC) with fast Fourier transform (FFT) done by a computer, and a DAC with real-time FFT based on FPGA (field-programmable gate array), respectively. According to the experimental results, we discuss several parameters and their influences on the SNR of the spectrum, including spectrum accumulation time, measurement efficiency and acquisition resolution. We find that the accumulation time is the most important factor for achieving high-quality spectrum. Measurement efficiency indicates how a good quality of the spin noise spectroscopy can be achieved in a finite time period, and we make a comparison of measurement efficiency among three methods. However, improvement of acquisition resolution does not make much more contribution to the quality of spin noise spectroscopy. Taken all into account, the DAC with real-time FFT performs best due to its bigger data utilization ratio, higher measurement efficiency and the multiplex advantage, thus it is more helpful for spin noise spectroscopy measurement in the study of spin dynamics. © 2017 Chinese Physical Society.","Faraday rotation; Rb vapor; Signal-to-noise ratio; Spin noise spectroscopy","Data acquisition; Efficiency; Faraday effect; Fast Fourier transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Rubidium; Signal receivers; Spin fluctuations; Thermodynamics; Comparison of measurements; Data acquisition cards; Fpga(field programmable gate array); Frequency analyzers; Measurement efficiency; Rb vapors; Spin noise spectroscopy; Thermal equilibriums; Signal to noise ratio",,,,,"Forrester, A.T., Gudmundsen, R.A., Johnson, P.O., (1955) Phys.

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors classify wildcards into three particular types which share similar character: natural wildcards, artificial wildcards (Degree 1) and artificial wildcards (Degree 2). Wildcards point to unexpected and surprising events including important results that can form watershed in the development of a specific trend. In addition, the authors present a Fuzzy TOPSIS model which can be used in various cases to prioritize a number of weak signals and put them in order, so that the most important ones are likely to yield the wildcard in the future Findings: The authors presented a classification of wildcards with the same characteristics being natural wildcards, artificial wildcards (Degree 1) and artificial wildcards (Degree 2). The authors also prioritized the weak signals to deal with the most important ones and take appropriate action in advance so as to minimize possible damages and maximize the benefits of potential wildcards in an uncertain environment. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors report on the prioritizing of weak signals by applying Fuzzy TOPSIS and classify wildcards. This is significant because, by identifying the most important weak signals, appropriate actions can be taken in the future if necessary.

The subject owes its relevance to the fact that traditional (classic) approaches to the strategic management of the operation and development of present-day enterprises within the high-tech sector are failing to align with the latest trends and cannot be used under conditions of non-linearity and stochastic changes within the framework of the current economic cycle and techno-economic paradigm. The inferences derived from this research study substantiate the advisability of using the methodological concept of foresighting for the purposes of strategic planning and managing the development of high-tech enterprises. Based on the findings of this study, the authors come to the following conclusions: foresighting is a relatively new tool for the strategic management of the innovation development of high-tech enterprises. That being said, considering that foresighting may involve the various public forces and employ the various channels for up-and-down communication between the entrepreneurial, scientific and public-governmental spheres, with decisions being focused on the long run, there is potential for a much wider scope of the search for and deployment of strategic benchmarks for the development of high-tech enterprises. The methodological concept of foresighting the innovation development of high-tech enterprises makes it possible to change the strategic adaptive approach to forecasting and planning their activity into the strategic constructive one. Sequential implementation of stages in foresighting makes it possible to determine the outline and alternative dimensions of the innovation development of high-tech enterprises through the use of special technology (horizon scanning and weak signal detection) and conduct the selection of promising projects, which, if implemented, will help achieve the goals set by the company.","Foresight project; Foresight research; Foresighting; High-tech enterprises; Innovation development; Roadmap; Strategic management; Strategy for innovation development; System of innovation management",,,,,,"Battistella, C., The organization of corporate foresight: A multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Brummer, V., Konnola, T., Salo, A., Mnogoobrazie v forsait-issledovaniyakh: Praktika otbora innovatsionnykh idei [Diversity in foresight: Insights from the fostering of innovation ideas] (2010) Foresight, 4 (4), pp. 56-68; Coates, V., Farooque, M., Klavans, R., Lapid, K., Linstone, H.A., Pistorius, C., Porter, A.L., On the future of technological forecasting (2001) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 67 (1), pp. 1-17; Cuhls, K., Johnston, R., Corporate foresight (2008) Future-oriented technology analysis: Strategic intelligence for an innovative economy, pp. 103-114. , In C.

In particular, the systematic scanning of external expert opinions has been shown to be effective for the early detection of emerging threats and opportunities in an organization's environment. However, organizations tend to focus on internal advice more than on advice from external experts. This can be critical for organizations if it leads to an inertia in internal judgment, resulting in blind spots or a failure to see weak signals in the firm's periphery. In this article, we introduce a structured framework for the collection and structuring of internal and external expert judgment. This so-called 360∘ Stakeholder Feedback tool provides a structured and quantitative approach for the detection and discussion of blind spots and weak signals in scenario planning processes. Thus, it can contribute to a better and more holistic judgment in the strategic process. We demonstrate the methodology based on a case from the German construction industry, in which we aggregate and analyze expert judgments from different stakeholder groups regarding the future of the industry. © 2015 International Institute of Forecasters","Expert judgment; Scenario planning; Stakeholder feedback",,,,,,"Aspinall, W., A route to more tractable expert advice (2010) Nature, 463 (7279), pp. 294-295; Bolger, F., Rowe, G., Delphi: Somewhere between Scylla and Charybdis?

The author directly connects the recent rise of corporate foresight with MNCs' growing need to fill the gaps in traditional corporate strategic management, which struggles with the challenges of today's global turbulent business-environment (known as VUCA world characterised by unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity). From this perspective, corporate foresight is capable of providing a number of viable responses. They include the significant expansion of the horizon of MNCs' long-term future vision, enhanced capabilities of business-environment scanning (identifying not only clearly visible trends but the so-called weak signals as well) and strengthening intra-firm communications over the course of the strategy development process, thus contributing to the implementation capacity of the multinational corporate team. Within the analysis of the actual corporate foresight practices of major multinationals, special attention is paid to the common features of foresight organisation (standard process phases, the typical set of methods used) and peculiarities related mainly to different MNCs' sector-specific environment characteristics, including the complexity and dynamics of change. An attempt is also made to describe the actual impact of corporate foresight activities on the effectiveness of the key functions of MNCs' strategic management. The author draws the conclusion that corporate foresight is becoming a core element of the strategic management architecture of multinational businesses, striving to protect and strengthen its global market positioning in an increasingly turbulent and unpredictable environment. For MNCs' top management, trying to find the right strategic course in a radically changing competitive landscape, this powerful tool is increasingly playing the same role as a GPS navigator for drivers lost in an unfamiliar city.","Corporate foresight; Corporate strategic management; Multinational corporations; Strategic positioning in global markets; Turbulent global environment",,,,,,"Ansoff, I., (1965) Corporate Strategy, , New York: McGrow-Hill; Ansoff, I., (1979) Strategic Management, , London: Macmillan; Ansoff, I., Declerck, R.P., Hayes, R.L., (1976) From Strategic Planning to Strategic Management.

Design/methodology/approach: In the first part, upon introducing corporate foresight from the two process and content perspectives, influential elements in this construct are discussed. Then, corporate foresight’s relationship with innovation and strategic decision-making is examined and its effect on organizational performance is analyzed within a structural model. Using interview and questionnaire, the data research were collected from the banking industry of Iran including 30 banks (state-commercial banks, specialist-state banks, interest-free loan funds and private banks). Through descriptive, inferential statistical analyses and structural equation modeling using SPSS and Smart PLS software, reliability of the measurement model with 576 samples was confirmed. Findings: The results show that the corporate foresight playing three roles of initiator, strategist, and opponent affects the innovation. Moreover, the research results suggest that using the data from the foresight and identifying the weak signals, we can reduce the uncertainty and issue prior warnings in order to enhance the quality of manager’s strategic decision making and promote the organizational performance.

Utilizing a helpful, four-part structure, the authors indicate how corporate foresight is fundamental to interpret and lead change, focusing on the two cornerstones of organization and management. They advocate the separation of Research (oriented to the market of tomorrow) from Development (oriented to the market of today), the establishment of a Foresight unit and the concentration of research activities mainly on the acquisition and recombination of external know-how. After an overview of state-of-the-art literature on forecasting methods, they further propose the implementation of a “future coverage” methodology, which will enable companies to measure and verify the consistency between trends, strategic vision and offered products. These organizational and managing tools are then tested in a case study: the Italian company Eurotech SpA, a leader in the ICT sector. A useful resource for both managers and researchers, the book will help readers gain the tools necessary to tackle change and navigate complexity in organizations. © 2017 Alberto F.

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, best international practice was analyzed that provided a solid basis for Russian S&T Foresight 2030 (section “Nanotechnology and new materials”). The study used a wide range of advanced Foresight methods adapted to Russian circumstances. During the Foresight study, the authors integrated “market pull” and research “technology push” approaches including both traditional methods (priority-setting, roadmaps, global challenges analysis) and relatively new approaches (horizon scanning, weak signals, wild cards, etc.). Findings: Using the methods of the Foresight, the authors identified trends with the greatest impact on the sphere of nanotechnology and new materials, promising markets, product groups and potential areas of demand for Russian innovation technologies and developments in this field. The authors assessed the state-of-the-art of the domestic research in the area of nanotechnologies and new materials to identify “white spots”, as well as parity zone and leadership, which can be the basis for integration into international alliances and positioning of Russia as a center of global technological development in this field. Originality/value: The results of applying Foresight methodology toward revelation of the most prospective S&T areas in the field of nanotechnologies and new materials can be used by a variety of stakeholders including federal and regional authorities, technology platforms and innovation and industrial clusters, leading universities and scientific organizations in formulation of their research and strategic agenda. Russian businesses including both large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises can use results of the study in creating their strategic R&D programs and finding appropriate partners. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advanced materials; Convergence; Foresight; Nanotechnologies; NBIC technologies; New materials",,,,,,"Nanotechnology (2006) The Industrial Revolution of the 21st Century; (2004) Nanotechnology Foresight in Asia-Pacific, , The APEC Center for Technology Foresight, Bangkok; (2008) Energy and Nanotechnologies: Strategy for Australia’s Future, , Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, Melbourne; Batra, V.S., Li, H.P., Oxygen carrier materials and their role in chemical looping reactions for fuel conversion (2017) Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering, 15, pp. 44-48; Cuhls, K., Blind, K., Grupp, H., Delphi ’98 umfrage (1998) Zukunft Nachgefragt, , (Eds Studie zur globalen Entwicklung von Wissenschaft und Technik, Karlsruhe (in German); (2010) Research Road Mapping in Materials, , European Commission, Brussels; Di Sia, P., Analytical nano-modelling for neuroscience and cognitive science (2014) Journal of Bioinformatics and Intelligent Control, 3 (4), pp. 268-272; Diallo, M.S., Brinker, J.C., Nanotechnology for sustainability: environment, water, food, minerals and climate (2011) Nanotechnology Research Directions for Societal Needs in 2020: Retrospective and Outlook, pp. 221-259. , Roco, M.C., Mirkin, M.C. and Hersham, M.and (Eds), Science Policy Reports, Springer, Dordrecht; (2010) US Department of Energy Critical Materials Strategy, , Department of Energy, The United States of America, Washington, DC; (2006) Roadmaps at 2015 on Nanotechnology Application in the Sectors of Materials, Health & Medical Systems, Energy, , AIRI / Nanotec IT, Roma; Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: an action plan for Europe 2005-2009“ (2009) Second Implementation Report 2007-2009, , http://cordis.europa.eu/nanotechnology/actionplan.htm, (accessed, 6 April 2016, Commission of the European Communities, Brussels; The global nanotechnology and nanomaterials industry: stage of development (2013) Global Activity and Market Opportunities; (2014) Nanomanufacturing: Emergence and Implications for US Competitiveness, the Environment, and Human Health, , www.gao.gov/assets/670/660591.pdf, (accessed, 25 February 2016, United States Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC; Goh, P.S., Ismail, A.F., Review: is interplay between nanomaterial and membrane technology the way forward for desalination?

The authors attribute particular attention to implication for Russia, which is relatively better positioned regarding the availability of water resources. However, the country still faces challenges related to the protection of water resources, drinking water supply, water networks, consumption patterns, water discharge, treatment and re-use. The present study aims at identification and analysis of trends, factors and uncertainties in water supply, demand, use and re-use with a particular focus on sustainability of water systems; water use by households and industry; and new water services and products. Design/methodology/approach: Research methodology in this paper involves a horizon scanning exercise for the identification of the key trends, factors and uncertainties along with the identification of weak signals of future emerging trends and wild cards in the form of future surprises, shocks and other unexpected events that may disrupt the preservation of water resources and the future of the water sector. Trends characterize broad parameters for shifts in attitudes, climate, policies and business focus over periods of several years that usually have global reach. These are usually experienced by everyone and often in similar contexts. Trends may represent threats, opportunities or a mixture of them, identified through underlying processes, possible events and other future developments. Findings: A key systemic restriction of water use for the next decades both globally and in Russia relates to competition between agriculture, energy, manufacturing and household water use. Given that the amount of renewable water resources is almost fixed and even decreases because of pollution, circular economy solutions for water use will be required. Implications of the global trends identified in the study for Russia are dependent on the overall situation with water resources in the country. Russia has sufficient water supply: the overall intake of water for drinking and economic purposes in Russia amounts to 3 per cent of the total water resources, two-thirds of which are discarded back to water bodies. At the same time, there are substantial problems associated with the extremely uneven distribution of water resources across the country, as well as high “water intensity” of the Russian GDP. The Russian water sector is currently not very attractive for investors. Moreover, it has significantly less lobbying opportunities than other infrastructure sectors, and this complicates its institutional and financial positions. Meanwhile, there have been some positive changes with regard to activities with a short pay-off period. Originality/value: The paper offers one of the first studies on the future of Russian water resources with a focus on the water supply and sanitation sector. A comprehensive approach to trends identification (not found in other studies on Russian water resources) allowed authors to identify social, technological, environmental, economic, policy and value-related global trends and uncertainties. Moreover, implications of these trends and uncertainties, as well as Russia-specific trends, were outlined. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Horizon scanning; Russia; Sustainable water systems; Water goods and services; Water resources; Water use",,,,,,"Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Foresighting for inclusive development (2016) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 1; Andersen, P.D., Rasmussen, L.B., The impact of national traditions and cultures on national foresight processes (2014) Futures, 59, pp. 5-17; Barbosa, A., Brusca, I., Governance structures and their impact on tariff levels of Brazilian water and sanitation corporations (2015) Utilities Policy, 34, pp. 94-105; Bouabid, A., Louis, G.E., Capacity factor analysis for evaluating water and sanitation infrastructure choices for developing communities (2015) Journal of Environmental Management, 161 (15), pp. 335-343; (2002) Defra’s Horizon Scanning Strategy for Science, Science Directorate, Defra Science Strategy Team, , December., Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London; Dellachiesa, A.E., Myint, A.P., Trade openness and the changing water polluting intensity patterns of ‘dirty’ and ‘clean’ industrial sectors (2016) Ecological Economics, 129, pp. 143-151; Ercin, A.E., Hoekstra, A.Y., Water footprint scenarios for 2050: a global analysis (2014) Environment International, 64 (1), pp. 71-82; Eshtawi, T., Evers, M., Tischbein, B., Diekkrüger, B., Integrated hydrologic modeling as a key for sustainable urban water resources planning (2016) Water Research, 101 (15), pp. 411-428; (2003) No global water crisis – but many developing countries will face water scarcity, , www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2003/15254-en.html, (accessed, 6 October 2016; (2011) ‘Energy-smart’ food for people and climate, , www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2454e/i2454e00.pdf, (accessed, 11 February 2015, Issue paper, FAO, Rome; Fedorov, G., (2016) When Baikal water will be more expensive than oil, Russia beyond the headlines, , https://rbth.com/politics_and_society/society/2016/02/05/when-baikal-water-will-be-more-expensive-than-oil_564923, February, (accessed, 6 October 2016; Fouial, A., Khadra, R., Daccache, A., Lamaddalena, N., Modelling the impact of climate change on pressurised irrigation distribution systems: use of a new tool for adaptation strategy implementation (2016) Biosystems Engineering, 150, pp. 182-190; Furukawa, D., (2008) A global perspective of low pressure membranes, , Final project report, National Water Research Institute; Gao, H., Wei, T., Lou, I., Yang, Z., Shen, Z., Li, Y., Water saving effect on integrated water resource management (2014) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 93 (1), pp. 50-58; Gleick, P.H., Allen, L., Christian-Smith, J., Cohen, M.J., Cooley, H., Heberger, M., Morrison, J., Schulte, P., (2011) The World’s Water Volume 7: The Biennial Report on Freshwater Resources Paperback; Grafton, R.Q., Chu, L., Kompas, T., Optimal water tariffs and supply augmentation for cost-of-service regulated water utilities (2015) Utilities Policy, 34 (1), pp. 54-62; Gu, A., Teng, F., Lv, Z., Exploring the nexus between water saving and energy conservation: insights from industry sector during the 12th Five-Year Plan period in China (2016) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 59, pp. 28-38; Guerra, K., Pellegrino, J., (2012) Investigation of low-pressure membrane performance, cleaning, and economics using a techno-economic modeling approach, , Science and Technology Program Report 174, US Department of Interior; Hoekstra, A.Y., Hung, P.Q., (2002) Virtual water trade: a quantification of virtual water flows between nations in relation to international crop trade, , Value of Water Research Report Series 11.

In a set of reviews, the review with the most helpfulness votes are seen as most helpful. While researchers have demonstrated how review and reviewer characteristics influence helpfulness votes, a largely uninvestigated issue is how herding behaviors can influence customers’ voting participation and direction. Drawing on herd behavior literature, we propose that review voters will discount their own information when faced with clear and strong signals from previous voters. Thus, they will herd previous voters’ voting direction. On the other hand, review voters will value their own judgments when faced with weak signals from previous voters. Herding can influence both a voter’s perception of a review’s helpfulness and his/her vote. This research extends review helpfulness literature that herd behaviors could moderates customers’ perception of review helpfulness and voting direction. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.

This paper aims to present results of this research. Design/methodology/approach: The study was based on a combination of technology-push and market-pull approaches that aimed not only to identify most promising science and technology (S&T) areas but also to understand how they can be realized in practice. Representatives from federal authorities, science and business were involved in the project to create future visions of technological directions; analyze grand challenges, weak signals and wild cards; and set research and development (R&D) priorities. Findings: According to results of the study, Russia has a potential for biotech sector development, although the level of R&D in the majority of areas is lagging behind that in the USA and leading EU countries. However, there are several advanced applied research areas where efforts can be focused. Among them are high-performance genomics and post-genomics research platforms, systems and structural biology, microbial metabolic engineering, plant biotechnology and microbial strains and consortia for development of symbiotic plant–microbial communities. Originality/value: Concentration of available resources of government and business on biotechnological sector development can help to find answers for challenges that Russia faces today or will face tomorrow. It will help to pick up on the current level of research activities, improve the quality of personnel training, make this area the engine of the economy and carry out the so-called new industrialization of the country, building a new, high-tech device industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bioeconomy; Biotechnologies; Foresight; Grand challenges; Innovative products; Long-term prognosis; Russia",,,,,,"Buyel, J.F., Process development strategies in plant molecular farming (2015) Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, 16 (11), pp. 966-982; Häggman, H., Raybould, A., Borem, A., Fox, T., Handley, L., Hertzberg, M., Lu, M.Z., McLean, M., Genetically engineered trees for plantation forests: key considerations for environmental risk assessment (2013) Plant Biotechnology Journal, 11 (7), pp. 785-798; Hartung, F., Schiemann, J., Precise plant breeding using new genome editing techniques: opportunities, safety and regulation in the EU (2014) Plant Journal, 78 (5), pp. 742-752; Hegde, K., Chandra, N., Sarma, S.J., Brar, S.K., Veeranki, V.D., Genetic engineering strategies for enhanced biodiesel production (2015) Molecular Biotechnology, 57 (7), pp. 606-624; Heux, S., Meynial-Salles, I., O’Donohue, M.J., Dumon, C., White biotechnology: state of the art strategies for the development of biocatalysts for biorefining (2015) Biotechnology Advances, 33 (8), pp. 1653-1670; Kilbane, J.J., II, Future applications of biotechnology to the energy industry (2016) Frontiers in Microbiology, , https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00086; Liang, P., Xu, Y., Zhang, X., Ding, C., Huang, R., Zhang, Z., Lv, J., Huang, J., CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes (2015) Protein & Cell, 6 (5), pp. 363-372; Mikova, N., Sokolova, A., Global technology trends monitoring: theoretical frameworks and best practices (2014) Foresight-Russia, 8 (4), pp. 64-83; (2016) Russia 2030: Science and Technology Foresight, , HSE, Moscow; (2016) Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects, , National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; (2015) Industrialization of Biology: A Roadmap to Accelerate the Advanced Manufacturing of Chemicals, , National Academies Press, Washington, DC; (2010) The Bioeconomy to 2030: Designing a Policy Agenda, , OECD, Paris; Pearce, D.W., Turner, R.K., (1989) Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore; Reen, F.J., Gutiérrez-Barranquero, J.A., Dobson, A.D., Adams, C., O’Gara, F., Emerging concepts promising new horizons for marine biodiscovery and synthetic biology (2015) Marine Drugs, 13 (5), pp. 2924-2954; Rossi, M., Bermudez, L., Carrari, F., Crop yield: challenges from a metabolic perspective (2015) Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 25, pp. 79-89; Siegert, M., Sitte, J., Galushko, A., Krüger, M., Starting up microbial enhanced oil recovery (2014) Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology, 142, pp. 1-94; Streltsova, E., Patent activity in biotechnology (2014) Foresight-Russia, 8 (1), pp. 52-65; (2015) Strategic Research Agenda, , Technological Platform Bioindustry and Bioresources, Moscow; (2012) State Programme for R&D development Order No̱ 2433-R of the 20th of December, 2012, , The Russian Government, Moscow; Verbeke, W., Sans, P., Van Loo, E., Challenges and prospects for consumer acceptance of cultured meat (2015) Journal of Integrative Agriculture, 14 (2), pp. 285-294; Weber, T., Charusanti, P., Musiol-Kroll, E.M., Jiang, X., Tong, Y., Kim, H.U., Lee, S.Y., Metabolic engineering of antibiotic factories: new tools for antibiotic production in actinomycetes (2015) Trends in Biotechnology, 33 (1), pp. 15-26; Yashveer, S., Singh, V., Kaswan, V., Kaushik, A., Tokas, J., Green biotechnology, nanotechnology and bio-fortification: perspectives on novel environment-friendly crop improvement strategies (2014) Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering Reviews, 30 (1-2), pp. 113-126","Grebenyuk, A.; Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge, National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: grebenyuk@hse.ru",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029871874

Our model builds on a general class of locally stationary VAR processes that evolve smoothly in time. We propose a hybridized kernel smoothing and ℓ 1 - regularized method to directly estimate the sequence of time-varying transition matrices. Under the sparsity assumption on the transition matrix, we establish the rate of convergence of the proposed estimator and show that the convergence rate depends on the smoothness of the locally stationary VAR processes only through the smoothness of the transition matrix function. In addition, for our estimator followed by thresholding, we prove that the false positive rate (type I error) and false negative rate (type II error) in the pattern recovery can asymptotically vanish in the presence of weak signals without assuming the minimum nonzero signal strength condition. Favorable finite sample performances over the ℓ 2 -penalized least-squares estimator and the unstructured maximum likelihood estimator are shown on simulated data. We also provide two real examples on estimating the dependence structures on financial stock prices and economic exchange rates datasets. © 2017, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

Technology scanning is the technology intelligence sub-discipline for finding weak signals (early warning signals) to technology trends, and as we conjecture also for finding signals on technology-driven impeding changes in evaluation contexts in relevant markets. To do so, technology scanning uses a toolbox of methods including prediction, scenario analysis, and trend analysis methods. The main challenge of dealing with disruptive technologies is the lack of guidance on how organizations can incorporate disruptive technologies into their service op-erations to improve their service delivery. To address this challenge, we examine whether Information Systems (IS) research can contribute to this guidance by developing a conceptual model. The goal of our research is to design a method to formalize a conceptual model that supports organizations in incorporating dis-ruptive technologies into their service organization. In this paper, we present pre-liminary results related to requirements for identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies in a company's context. We also present an analysis of existing methods and design options (process, organizations, technology) for technology scanning regarding these requirements.","Control; Disruptive technology; Early warning signals; Morphology; Operations; Peo-ple; Precursor; Process; Service delivery; Service operations; Strategy; Technology; Technology; Technology scanning","Control; Decision making; Morphology; Processing; Societies and institutions; Technology; Disruptive technology; Early warning; Operations; Precursor; Service delivery; Service operations; Strategy; Technology scanning; Scanning",,,,,"Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Boston MA: Harvard Business School Press; Danneels, E., Disruptive Technology reconsidered: A critique and research agenda (2004) Jour-nal of Product Innovation Management, 21 (4), pp. 246-258; Paggettt, D., Mulvey, M.S., Differentiation via technology: Strategic positioning of services following the introduction of disruptive technology (2007) Journal of Retailing, 83 (4), pp. 375-391; Eckhard, L., (2002) Organisation der Technology Intelligence.

That's especially important if they do not possess high-quality and reliable information database on the state of internal and external environment. Thus, the purpose of this paper is the development of specialized probability diagnostic techniques for enterprise operating under the conditions of uncertainty. Two basic research methods were used in our research. Firstly, the study was conducted on the basis of review and analysis of specialized literature in the field of information diagnostic support of enterprises under the conditions of uncertainty. This allowed us to propose our own solution in this regard. Secondly, the developed diagnostic method was tested on one of the Ukrainian enterprises. The obtained results enabled us to determine the most probable threat to the functioning of the entity. We also conducted the quantitative assessment of its possible impact on the performance of the company. Therefore, suggested diagnostic techniques aim at forming the grounded information basis about different potential changes of business environment, as well as the enough time reserve, and can be recommended for the company's managers during the decision-making process under the conditions of uncertainty.","Diagnostics; Functioning environment; Information; Opportunities; Threats; Uncertainty; Weak signals",,,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., (1988) The New Corporate Strategy, , 1st Edition.

The research is focused on the relevant topic of mutual relations between music and leadership. Both, possibilities and advantages of music, as well as its dangers, when used for the purposes of manipulation, attract interest of scholars, philosophers and sociologists. The authors deal with the influence of music in the process of self-creation, or opposite – self-destruction. The research begins with a brief philosophical review of possible advantages and disadvantages of music and its influence on the process of education of youths and formation of the qualities of leaders. As said, this research is focused on a stream (trend) which is evaluated between leadership and music. A picture from a probable scenario and future is presented which has not sensed till now. This mentioned picture can be considered as a weak signal from a bigger universal image. The hermeneutic approach and trend analysis were the main methods of this research, and finally the authors come to the conclusion that in the world of music one may expect fundamental changes and their influence would even grow.

This paper investigates the latter. When the environment becomes uncertain or when organizations engage in an organizational transformation, inertia or the propensity of an organization to continue its run on the same path is dangerous. Based on a survey with 108 senior managers, this paper investigates the relationships between three dynamic capabilities and Socio-Technical (ST) inertia. Results supports the general idea that the greater the capability to sense weak signals, to routinize experience of past transformations, and to reconfigure strategic resources, the lower the ST inertia. Moreover, the effect of reconfiguring is amplified with the uncertainty of the environment. Identification and understanding of particular contingencies such as firm size and industry can shed additional light on this phenomenon. © 2017 Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2017.

Previous attempts of data-driven technology roadmaps have mainly focused on data from such sources as patents and literatures. However, as these sources catalogue posteriori trends of evolution, roadmaps based on these data cannot be counted on to predict disruptions. In this regard, futuristic data in technology foresight websites may provide a better source. The objective of this research, in response, is to develop a support system for technology roadmapping that uses futuristic data. To this end, we suggest keyword-based visual scanning approach involving three keyword maps, used in succession: keyword cluster map, keyword intensity map, and keyword relationship map. Particularly, keyword intensity map is designed using weak signal theory which can help identify the visibility, diffusion, and interpretation of signals. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","futuristic data; Technology roadmapping; visual analysis; weak signal","technological development; visual analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, (2), pp. 21-34. , citeulike-article-id:1109593; Cable, J.H., Ordonez, J.F., Chintalapani, G., Plaisant, C., (2004), “Project Portfolio Earned Value Management Using Treemaps.” Proceedings of the Project Management Institute Research Conference, London; Cachia, R., Compañó, R., Da Costa, O., Grasping the Potential of Online Social Networks for Foresight (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74 (8), pp. 1179-1203; Choi, S., Kim, H., Yoon, J., Kim, K., Lee, J.Y., An SAO-Based Text-Mining Approach for Technology Roadmapping Using Patent Information (2013) R and D Management, 43 (1), pp. 52-74; Christensen, C.M., Baumann, H., Ruggles, R., Sadtler, T.M., Disruptive Innovation for Social Change (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (12), pp. 94-101; Davies, D.L., Bouldin, D.W., A Cluster Separation Measure (1979) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine IntelligencePAMI-1, (2), pp. 224-227; Drew, S.A.W., Building Technology Foresight: Using Scenarios to Embrace Innovation (2006) European Journal of Innovation Management, 9 (3), pp. 241-257; Flexer, A., On the Use of Self-Organizing Maps for Clustering and Visualization (2001) Intelligent Data Analysis, 5 (5), pp. 373-384. , IOS Press; Geum, Y., Lee, H.J., Lee, Y., Park, Y., Development of Data-Driven Technology Roadmap Considering Dependency: An ARM-Based Technology Roadmapping (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 91, pp. 264-279. , Elsevier Inc; Hamel, G., (2002) Leading the Revolution: How to Thrive in Turbulent Times by Making Innovation a Way of Life, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Hiltunen, E., The Future Sign and Its Three Dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Jeong, Y., Yoon, B., Development of Patent Roadmap Based on Technology Roadmap by Analyzing Patterns of Patent Development (2015) Technovation, 39-40 (May), pp. 37-52; Kim, J., Park, Y., (2014), “Supporting Technology Foresight for Disruptive Innovation : Keyword-Based Visual Analysis for Futuristic Data.” Proceedings of the Asia Pacific Industrial Engineering & Management Systems Conference 2014, Jeju, South Korea; Kohonen, T., The Self-Organizing Map (1998) Neurocomputing, 21 (1-3), pp. 1-6; Kostoff, R.N., Boylan, R., Simons, G.R., Disruptive Technology Roadmaps (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 141-159; Lee, S., Lee, S., Seol, H., Park, Y., Using Patent Information for Designing New Product and Technology: Keyword Based Technology Roadmapping (2008) R&D Management, 38 (2), pp. 169-188; Martin, H., Daim, T., Technology Roadmapping through Intelligence Analysis: Case of Nanotechnology (2008) International Journal of Society Systems Science, 1 (1), pp. 49-66; Mendonça, S., Cardoso, G., Caraça, J., The Strategic Strength of Weak Signal Analysis (2012) Futures, 44 (3), pp. 218-228; Morris, S., DeYong, C., Wu, Z., Salman, S., Yemenu, D., DIVA: A Visualization System for Exploring Document Databases for Technology Forecasting (2002) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 43 (4), pp. 841-862; Paap, J., Katz, R., Anticipating Disruptive Innovation (2004) IEEE Engineering Management Review, 32 (4), pp. 74-85; Pang, A.S.K., Futures 2.0: Rethinking the Discipline (2010) Foresight, 12 (1), pp. 5-20; Park, H., Kim, K., Choi, S., Yoon, J., A Patent Intelligence System for Strategic Technology Planning (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (7), pp. 2373-23790; Phaal, R., Farrukh, C.J.P., Probert, D.R., Technology Roadmapping – A Planning Framework for Evolution and Revolution (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 5-26; Rossel, P., Weak Signals as a Flexible Framing Space for Enhanced Management and Decision-Making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21 (3), pp. 307-320; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The Big Picture – Trends, Drivers, Wild Cards, Discontinuities and Weak Signals (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 292-312; Schatzmann, J., Schäfer, R., Eichelbaum, F., Foresight 2.0 – Definition, Overview & Evaluation (2013) European Journal of Futures Research, 1 (1), pp. 1-15; Shneiderman, B., Dunne, C., Sharma, P., Wang, P., Innovation Trajectories for Information Visualizations: Comparing Treemaps, Cone Trees, and Hyperbolic Trees (2012) Information Visualization, 11 (2), pp. 87-105; Vesanto, J., Himberg, J., (1999), “Self-Organizing Map in Matlab: The SOM Toolbox.” The Matlab DSP Conference 1999, 35–40.

They span over long periods of time, use encrypted connections and mimic normal behaviors in order to evade detection based on traditional defensive solutions. We propose an innovative approach that is able to analyze efficiently high volumes of network traffic to reveal weak signals related to data exfiltrations and other suspect APT activities. The final result is a ranking of the most suspicious internal hosts; this rank allows security specialists to focus their analyses on a small set of hosts out of the thousands of machines that typically characterize large organizations. Experimental evaluations in a network environment consisting of about 10K hosts show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our proposal based on security analytics paves the way to novel forms of automatic defense aimed at early detection of APTs in large and continuously varying networked systems. © 2016","Advanced Persistent Threats; Data exfiltration; Security analytics; Traffic analysis","Advanced Persistent Threats; Data exfiltration; Experimental evaluation; Innovative approaches; Large organizations; Network environments; nocv1; Security Analytics; Traffic analysis; Internet",,,,,"Brewer, R., Advanced persistent threats: minimising the damage (2014) Netw.

Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive search, big data-based mate recommendations, and varying levels of anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to check out a potential mate's profile while not leaving any visible online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates ""weak signals"" of interest for their potential mates that may play an important role in establishing successful communication. We run a randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited, in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated by a corresponding increase in quality of matches.

Although research has examined frameworks and concepts that lead to high-quality performance, few studies examine how to sustain high-quality performance. Sustaining performance may require additional capabilities from what it takes to achieve it. Drawing on quality management literature, organizational resilience literature, and the theory of dynamic capabilities in the strategy literature, this study empirically investigates the effects of four capabilities that help sustain high-quality performance. The analysis shows that capabilities in improvement, innovation, sensing weak signals, and responsiveness all help sustain high-quality performance. This suggests that what it takes to achieve high-quality performance is different, in part, from what it takes to sustain it. The data comes from a survey of 147 manufacturing business units. The analysis shows that the relative benefits of these capabilities may depend on the level of competitive intensity and environmental uncertainty. The findings provide empirical support for a theoretical model and practical guidance for sustaining quality performance. © 2016 Decision Sciences Institute","Dynamic capability; High reliability; Quality management; Resilience; Sustaining performance",,,,,,"Ahire, S.L., An empirical investigation of quality management in small firms (1996) Production & Inventory Management Journal, 37 (2), pp. 44-50; Ahire, S.L., O'Shaughnessy, K.C., The role of top management commitment in quality management: An empirical analysis of the auto parts industry (1998) International Journal of Quality Science, 3 (1), pp. 5-37; Aiken, L., West, S., (1991), #x0026;, Multiple regression Testing and interpreting interactions, Newbury Park, CA, Sage; Bagozzi, R.P., (1994), Advanced methods of marketing research, Cambridge, MA, Blackwell Business; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Benson, P.G., Saraph, J.V., Schroeder, R.G., The effects of organizational context on quality management: An empirical investigation (1991) Management Science, 37 (9), pp. 1107-1124; Berry, L.L., Parasuraman, A., Listening to the customer-the concept of a service-quality information system (1997) Sloan Management Review, 38, pp. 65-76; Bode, C., Wagner, S.M., Petersen, K.J., Ellram, L.M., Understanding responses to supply chain disruptions: Insights from Information processing and resource dependence perspectives (2011) Academy of Management Journal, 54 (4), pp. 833-856; Bodek, N., Green, J., (2011), #x0026;,).

Using the social media Twitter as a data source helps to detect weaker signals that are not captured through traditional census data. In this study, neighbourhoods in Milan are identified as areas where people speak mainly the same language on Twitter and these results are then compared with census data, to underline any parallelisms or discrepancies between the two sources of data. An added value of the paper is that the results are implemented within an online city dashboard, called Urbanscope. © Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

As such crises are viewed as the result of a combination of two complementary cumulative processes of dysfunctions and ignorance. The concept of weak signal is introduced as an integral part of a theory of crisis to extend our conception of crisis and put forward the notion of genealogy of surprise. This approach to crisis contributes to the merging of risk communication and crisis communication because it acknowledges the developmental features of risks and crises, and recognizes that communication must be an integrated and ongoing process. Implications for risk and crisis communication are discussed in the conclusion. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Crisis; Crisis communication; Crisis definition; Crisis management; Crisis stages; Crisis theory; Risk communication; Weak signals",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Billings, R.S., Milburn, T.W., Schaalman, M.L., A model of crisis perception: A theoretical and empirical analysis (1980) Administrative Science Quarterly, 25, pp. 300-316; Boin, A., Lessons from crisis lessons (2004) International Studies Review, 6, pp. 165-194; Coombs, W.T., Information and compassion in crisis responses: A test of their effects (1999) Journal of Public Relations Research, 11 (2), pp. 125-142; Coombs, W.T., Holladay, S.J., Unpacking the halo effect: Reputation and crisis management (2006) Journal of Communication Management, 10 (2), pp. 123-137; Deschamps, I., Lalonde, M., Pauchant, T.C., Waaub, J.P., What crises could teach us about complexity and systemic management: The case of the Nestucca oil spill (1997) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 55, pp. 107-129; Forgues, B., Roux-Dufort, C., Crises: Events or processes (1998), Paper presented at Hazards and Sustainability Conference, Durham, UK, May 26-27; Francis, W., Catastrophes: une histoire culturelle, XVIe-XXIe siècles [Catastrophes: A cultural history, 16th-21st centuries] (2008), Paris: éditions du Seuil; Gundel, S., Towards a new typology of crises (2005) Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management, 13, pp. 106-115; Hermann, C.F., Some consequences of crisis which limit the viability of organizations (1963) Administrative Science Quarterly, 8, pp. 61-82; Hiltunen, E., The future signs and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 247-260; Janis, I.L., Crucial decisions: Leadership in policymaking and crisis management (1989), New York: Simon and Schuster; Kovoor-Misra, S., A multidimensional approach to crisis preparation for technical organizations: some critical factors (1995) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 48, pp. 143-160; Kouzmin, A., Crisis management in crisis (2008) Administrative Theory and Praxis, 30, pp. 155-183; Kuosa, T., Evolution of future studies (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 327-336; Lagadec, P., Katrina: Examen des rapports d'enquête [Katrina: Analysis of the investigation reports] (2007), Working Paper 2007-07, école Polytechnique, Paris; Lalonde, C., Roux-Dufort, C., Crisis management in institutional healthcare settings: From punitive to emancipatory solutions (2010) Organization Development Journal, 28 (1), pp. 19-36; Laufer, D., Coombs, W.T., How should a company respond to a product harm crisis?

To enjoy the power of them, the human society needs solutions to transform the energies mentioned above into electric energy, at specific reliability, efficiency and sustainability parameters. Maintaining this kind of parameters implies, among other things, the careful and permanent monitoring of equipment. The monitoring process implies remote monitoring, as we are talking about preserving natural resources. The equipment is mostly situated in the middle of nature, covering large areas mostly outside of populated locations. In their great majority installations for wind and solar energy have been designed and manufactured relatively recently, which makes them contain systems of tele-monitoring that are designed and included by default, as a part of great importance to the entire investment. The situation is different in the case of hydroelectric plants, which have a tradition of over 130 years and have been and are still built to this day. Renewable energy sources are being increasingly used and need to be constantly monitored for optimizing the power grid. Unfortunately, such micro power plants are located in difficult to access remote locations where often only satellite or sparse GSM radio signals are available. In this paper we study the way how to process big data gathered by a decentralized cloud system, based on general systems and remote telemetry units (RTUs), for tele-monitoring of renewable energy objectives. Also, we analyze a proposed cloud M2M system, where each RTU communicates by radio with a telemetry data gateway connected to a cloud computing infrastructure equipped with appropriate software that delivers processed data. Furthermore, we present how we use a search based application built on Exalead CloudView to search for weak signals in big data. In particular, given the telemetry application, we propose to leverage trivial and non-trivial connections between different sensor signals and data from other online environmental wireless sensor networks, in order to find patterns that are likely to provide innovative solutions to existing problems. The aggregation of such weak signals will provide evidence of connections between renewable energies and environmental related issues faster and better than trivial mining of sensor data. As a consequence, the software has a significant potential for matching environmental applications and challenges that are related in non-obvious ways. Finally, we present the measurement results for a hydro-energy case study and discuss the applicability for other renewable sources such as solar or wind energy. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Big data; Cloud; IoT; M2M; Renewable energy","Application programs; Clouds; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Gateways (computer networks); Greenhouse gases; Investments; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Telemetering equipment; Wind power; Wireless sensor networks; Cloud computing infrastructures; Environmental applications; Hydroelectric plant; Innovative solutions; IoT; M2M; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Big data",,,,,"Vermesan, O., Friess, P., Guillemin, P., Gusmeroli, S., Internet of things strategic research agenda.

Yet, the exact implications of complexity science for FS remain somewhat opaque. This paper explicitly sets out the challenges for FS that arise from six complexity science concepts: (1) irreversibility of time (2) path dependence 3) sensitivity to initial conditions (4) emergence and systemness (5) attractor states (6) complex causation. The discussion highlights the implications of these challenges for FS tools such as horizon scanning and weak signals, and sets out the benefits of overcoming the challenges to create an explicitly complexity-orientated FS. The discussion concludes with a set of questions summarising the challenge for FS from complexity science with the aim of stimulating a discussion as to how they can be met. The concluding remarks make some initial suggestions in this regard. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Complexity science; Emergence; Futures Studies; Horizon scanning; Scenario planning; Uncertainty; Weak signals","complexity; future prospect; planning process; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Multi-ontology, sense-making and the emergence of the future (2009) Futures, 41, pp. 279-283; Aiginger, K., The great recession vs. the great depression: stylized facts on siblings that were given different foster parents (2010) Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment e-Journal, 4; Aldred, J., Climate change uncertainty, irreversibility and the precautionary principle (2012) Cambridge Journal of Economics, 36, pp. 1051-1072; Almunia, M., Benetrix, A., Eichengreen, B., O'Rourke, K.H., Rua, G., From great depression to great credit crisis: similarities, differences and lessons (2010) Economic Policy, 25, pp. 219-265; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 28, pp. 28-33; Arthur, W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by small historical events (1989) Economic Journal, 99, pp. 116-131; Arthur, W.B., (2009) The nature of technology: what it is and how it evolves, , Penguin, London; Axtell, R., The complexity of exchange (2005) The Economic Journal, 115, pp. F193-F210; Ayres, R.U., Axtell, R., Foresight as a survival characteristic: when (if ever) does the long view pay?

Thus far, the attacks on mass transport have been about twice as lethal as terrorist attacks overall. Mass transport systems are typically of open design layout with multiple access points, and these characteristics make the process of screening challenging. Therefore, the early identification of an attack plan is the most efficient way to protect such systems. This paper aims to better understand the attack phenomenon and to develop a new approach for the systematic identification of possible weak signals and their sources. If such weak signals can be timely detected and correctly interpreted, this could improve awareness and thus possibilities for intervention. The developed approach is demonstrated by applying it to two well-known but different cases: the Tokyo sarin attack of 1995 and the 2005 London bombings. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Mass transport; Terror attack; Weak signal","Mass transfer; Transportation; Damage scenarios; Multiple access points; Safety and securities; Systematic identification; Terror attacks; Terrorist attacks; Transport systems; Weak signals; Terrorism; identification method; public transport; signal processing; technology adoption; terrorism; transportation system",,,,,"Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

RTI Foresight practitioners need to complement their well developed set of technology oriented methods with equally sophisticated approaches tackling societal aspects of innovation. In this paper we aim to make a contribution to this requirement. Building on user innovation theory we argue that demand oriented RTI Foresight needs to systematically integrate voices and hypotheses from the fringes of the innovation system. In order to develop a sound approach for this we set out from well established Foresight theory on ""weak signals"" and ""cognitive biases"". Adopting a constructivist stance towards such signals leads us to the need to set up a socially robust, diverse discourse on ""seeds of change hypotheses"". We then outline a practical implementation of such a discourse in the context of the recent Foresight process of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany. We describe and discuss the experience of this Foresight process and suggest avenues for further development of the approach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive biases; Demand oriented RTI policy; Innovation policy; Lead user theory; Perception filters; Seeds of change; Weak signals","innovation; research; technology policy; theory; Germany",,,,,"Aichholzer, G., The Austrian foresight programme: organisation and expert profile (2001) International Journal of Technology Management, 21 (7-8), pp. 739-755; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, XVIII, pp. 21-33; Bijker, W.E., Law, J., (1997) Shaping technology/building society.

Based on proposing overall technical indicators and analyzing its working principle of the signal amplifier, we use chip LMH6629MF and two chips of AD797BN to achieve three-level cascade amplification. And apply hardware of DSP TMS320VC5509A to implement digital filtering. Design and verification by Multisim, Protel 99SE and CCS, the results show that: the amplifier can realize continuously adjustable amplification from 1000 to 10000 times without distortion. Magnification error is ≤%4@1000∼10000. And equivalent input noise voltage of amplification circuit is ≤6 nV/ √Hz @30KHz∼45KHz, and realizing function of adaptive filtering.

Developing predictive foresight of the unpredictable changes that this journey will entail could contribute to the ambition of ‘ending AIDS’. There are few opportunities for managing unpredictable changes. We introduce ‘weak signal detection’ as a potential opportunity to fill this void. Method: Combining futures and complexity theory, we reflect on two pilot case studies that involved the Archetype Extraction technique and the SenseMaker® Collector™ tool. Results: Both the piloted techniques have the potentials to surface weak signals – but there is room for improvement. Discussion: A management response to a complex weak signal requires pattern management, rather than an exclusive focus on behaviour management. Conclusion: Weak signal detection is a window of opportunity to improve resilience to unpredictable changes in the HIV/AIDS landscape that can both reduce the risk that emerges from the changes and increase the visibility of opportunities to exploit the unpredictable changes that could contribute to ‘ending AIDS’. © 2016 The Author(s).

Researchers generally identify collective action by small changes in communication frequency, emerging key words, and sentiment. However, most studies only consider the present environment, which may not evolve into a collective action, or conduct a short-term prediction in which significant damage is already done when the collective action is identified. This paper proposes a predictive framework to identify potential collective actions, considering the future evolution as well as the present situation, and providing a reference for early decision making. In the framework, a future sign to describe events is improved and the enhanced gray system theory is used to predict the evolution of a future sign. Mentions of events surrounding the Arab Spring-using over 300000 different open-content Web sources crawled from social media in seven different languages-are analyzed, which suggests that the predictive framework can more precisely identify the weak signals of collective actions. © 2017 IEEE.","Collective action; Future sign; Gray system theory; Weak signal","Decision making; System theory; Collective action; Communication frequency; Future sign; Government management; Gray system theory; Present situation; Short term prediction; Weak signals; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Kallus, N., Predicting crowd behavior with big public data (2014) Proc. 23rd Int.

In this paper, a novel framework based on Passive Radar System is designed for weak object signal separation. Firstly, we propose an Interference Cancellation algorithm (IC-algorithm) to extract the mixed weak object signals from the strong jamming. Then, an improved FastICA algorithm with K -means cluster is designed to separate each weak signal from the mixed weak object signals. At last, we discuss the performance of the proposed method and verify the novel method based on several simulations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2016 Chengjie Li et al.",,"Algorithms; Blind source separation; Clustering algorithms; Jamming; Radar; Radar signal processing;

The paper presents selected issues concerning the project knowledge management, early warning systems, the concept of weak signals, as well as risk analysis. There is a need for their synthesis in order to efficiently recognize the potential opportunities and threats in the project life cycle. The proposed model of an early warning system based on knowledge integrates the elements of the theory and solutions unprecedented in project management. The basic idea is that the system should provide information concerning situations that threaten the implementation of projects, about dangerous phenomena and processes as well as the probability of their development. The system should allow rapid and flexible response to the forthcoming events, which in turn should translate into faster adaptation to adverse situations arising during the implementation of the project. It is proposed to assign prediction of threats with the identification of project risks in the form of a rule-based expert system. The capture of potential opportunities constitutes at this stage of the study only an added value and does not prejudge the functionality of the proposed system.

Technology trends such as additive manufacturing (""3D printing"") and the Internet of Things with its applications such as Industrie 4.0 in production technology are seen by companies as both major opportunities and threats to their business models on an abstract level, yet the identification and especially evaluation of specific technologies impacting a company's business in the future is still difficult. Disruptive technologies threaten market incumbents as these technologies enable addressing new or latent customer requirements or evaluation dimensions in a given market rather than improving on the fulfillment of existing evaluation criteria. When the value customers place on requirements and evaluation criteria (i.e. The evaluation context) changes, this can lead to rapid devaluation of products or services using traditional technologies. Technology Scanning is the technology intelligence sub-discipline responsible for finding weak signals of technological trends, and as we conjecture also for finding signals on technology-driven impeding changes in evaluation contexts in relevant markets. To do so, Technology Scanning uses a toolbox of methods including forecasting, scenario analysis, and trend analysis methods. We have previously stated the need for practitioners to have a framework of design recommendations for technology scanning based on the specific company's strategic goals on the identification of disruptive technologies, and outlined a research agenda on providing such a framework. As part of this research agenda, in this paper we present an overview of requirements for identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies in a company's context, and give an analysis of existing methods and design options (processes, organizations etc.) for technology scanning regarding these requirements. We proceed to outline a method to systematically detect possible changes in evaluation contexts to assist identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies using cross-industry analogies. We find that concepts from technology intelligence need to be complemented with concepts from market intelligence and environmental scanning to properly evaluate upcoming disruptive changes.","Disruptive Technologies; Technology Intelligence; Technology Scanning","3D printers; Commerce; Industrial management; Scanning; Three dimensional computer graphics; Customer requirements; Design recommendations; Disruptive technology; Environmental scanning; Production technology; Technological trends; Technology intelligence; Technology scanning; Environmental technology",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E.J., (1990) Implanting Strategic Management, , 2nd ed.

This research advances knowledge on the practice of foresight in long-term planning through a comparative analysis of planning approaches in two organisations linked through common ownership. Data generated from planning documentation and the foresight practice of strategy personnel in the two cases (transport and banking) provided support for a dynamic model of foresight integrated LT planning. The ongoing collection and synthesis of strong and weak signals, and their continual assimilation into scenarios depicting alternative futures was structurally supported by a community-of-practice. The community-of-practice widely engaged strategists located across organisational levels in conversations about emerging futures and about strategies through which to engage those futures. The findings encourage managers and researchers to view long-term planning as an ongoing interrogation of implemented and envisioned strategies within emerging, alternative futures. Such an approach stimulates strategic entrepreneurship and prepares the organisation for engaging in future environments. © 2013.","Community-of-practice; Foresight; Long-term planning","Technological forecasting; Community of practice; Comparative analysis; Foresight; Long term planning; Organisational level; Research advances; Strategic capability; Weak signals; Innovation",,,,,"Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, 1. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; Ofek, E., Wathieu, L., Are you ignoring trends that could shape up your business?

We identify and estimate the model with a large panel that matches data on publicly listed firms to information on their executives. The structural estimates obtained are used to decompose the firm-size pay gap. We find that although total compensation and incentive pay increase with firm size, certainty-equivalent pay decreases with firm size. In larger firms, and for more highly ranked executives, weaker signal quality about effort results in higher risk premiums. This risk premium accounts for roughly 80 percent of the firm-size gap in total compensation. Larger firms are also willing to pay more than smaller ones to attract executives. Finally, the estimated coefficients on human capital accumulation from formal education and experience gained from different firms are individually significant, but their collective effect on firm-size pay differentials nets out. © 2015 The Econometric Society.","asymmetric information; career concern; compensating differential; executive compensation; firm-size pay differential; identification; moral hazard; sequential equilibrium; structural estimation; Agency cost",,,,,,"Alchian, A.A., Demsetz, H., Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization (1972) American Economic Review, 62, pp. 777-795; Altug, S., Miller, R.A., The Effect of Work Experience on Female Wages and Labour Supply (1998) Review of Economic Studies, 65, pp. 45-85; Andersen, S., Harrison, G.W., Lau, M.I., Rutstrom, E.E., Eliciting Risk and Time Preferences (2008) Econometrica, 76, pp. 583-618; Antle, R., Smith, A., Measuring Executive Compensation: Methods and an Application (1985) Journal of Accounting Research, 23, pp. 296-325; Antle, R., Smith, A., An Empirical Investigation of the Relative Performance Evaluation of Corporate Executives (1986) Journal of Accounting Research, 24, pp. 1-39; Antonovics, K., Golan, L., Experimentation and Job Choice (2012) Journal of Labor Economics, 30, pp. 333-366; Aron, D.J., Ability, Moral Hazard, Firm Size, and Diversification (1988) Rand Journal of Economics, 19, pp. 72-87; Baker, G.P., Hall, B.J., CEO Incentives and Firm Size (2004) Journal of Labor Economics, 22, pp. 767-798; Bayer, P., Khan, S., Timmins, C., Nonparametric Identification and Estimation in a Roy Model With Common Nonpecuniary Returns (2011) Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 29, pp. 201-215; Becker, G.S., (1964) Human Capital, , New York: National Bureau for Economic Research; Bellman, R., (1957) Dynamic Programming, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Ben-Porath, Y., The Production of Human Capital and the Life Cycle of Earnings (1967) Journal of Political Economy, 75, pp. 352-365; Brown, C., Medoff, J., The Employer Size-Wage Effect (1989) Journal of Political Economy, 97, pp. 1027-1059; Cahuc, P., Postel-Vinay, F., Robin, J.M., Wage Bargaining With on-the-Job Search: Theory and Evidence (2006) Econometrica, 74, pp. 323-364; Calvo, G.A., Wellisz, S., Technology, Entrepreneurs, and Firm Size (1980) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 95, pp. 663-677; Chevalier, J., Ellison, G., Career Concerns of Mutual Fund Managers (1999) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114, pp. 389-432; Debreu, G., (1959) Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium, 17. , Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics Monograph.

To do so, we use the concepts of meta-organizations and partial organizations that were developed by Ahrne and Brunsson (2008, 2010). We conduct a case study of the oil and gas sector and show that while literature has expected these devices to retreat due to globalization and weakening of states and collective negotiations, they actually remain a powerful mean of collective action between firms. Notably, firms widely use these devices to deal with CSR and sustainable development issues, in relation with all the different stakeholders. From a strategic standpoint, these collective action devices allow firms to manage reputational effects and weak signals coming from the environment, as well as to neutralize conflicts with stakeholders. From the institutional standpoint, the invention of new organizational forms since the 1960s - business thematic and multi-stakeholder meta-organizations - occurred in a dynamics of institutional complementarity Indeed, these devices rely on one another and complete each other, therefore allowing firms to develop a broad range of collective strategies. © Presses Universitaires de France.","Collective action; Collective strategies; Devices; Meta-organization; Partial organization",,,,,,"Ahrne, G., Brunsson, N., (2008) Meta-organizations, , Cheltenham, Edward Elgar Publishing; Ahrne, G., Brunsson, N., L'organisation en dehors des organisations, ou l'organisation incomplète (2010) Le Libellio d'AEGIS, 6 (1), pp. 36-52; Andolfatto, D., Labbé, D., (2012) Sociologie des Syndicats, , Paris, La Découverte; Aoki, M., (2001) Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis, , Cambridge MA, MIT Press; Astley, G.W., Fombrun, C., Collective strategy: Social ecology of organizational environments (1983) Academy of Management Review, 8 (4), pp. 576-587; Barley, S., Signifying institutions (2010) Management Communication Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 200-206; Baron, D., Integrated strategy: Market and nonmarket components (1995) California Management Review, 37 (2), pp. 47-65; Baron, D., (2010) Business and its Environment, , Upper Saddle River, Prentice-Hall, 6 th ed; Bastianutti, J., Dumez, H., Pourquoi les entreprises sont-elles désormais reconnues comme socialement responsables ?

On the one hand it considers the external approach, that is, the analysis of visible signals linked to the emerging issues that in an early stage are called ""weak signals"". On the other hand, it tries to study emerging issues taking into account their internal motivations. In this case the aim is to value the social, economic or other kind of reasons that are hidden under emerging issues. A post-structuralism perspective (CLA, causal layered analysis) is used to address this objective.This double approach allows to consider emerging issues in a holistic way, taking into account what is visible and what is not so apparent. In order to offer conclusions and results a real use case is included analyzing the emerging issues showed in the report ""Informe de la Sociedad de la Información 2013"" (one of the references about information society situation and ICT trends in Spain). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CLA; Emerging issues; Igor Ansoff; SIE2013; Weak signals","assessment method; information and communication technology; Spain",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., (1975), 18 (2). , Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals California Management Review; Ansoff, I.H., Using weak signals (1984) Implanting strategic management, p. 20. , Pretince/Hall International Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Ashley, D.B., Project Risk Identification Using Inference Subjective Expert Assessment and Historical Data, The State of the Art in Project Risk Management (1989) International Project Management Association, Proceeding 1989, pp. 9-25; Battistella, C., The organisation of corporate foresight: a multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Beer, S., (1972) Brain of the firm, allen lane, , The Penguin Press, London; Brabandere, L., (2005), pp. 52-55. , False endings, weak signals; putting together the odd pieces of information that could save your business, Across the Board; Coffman, B., Weak signals research (1997) Part I: introduction, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak signals research (1997) Part II: information theory, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak signal research (1997) Part IV: evolution and growth of the weak signal to maturity, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Daheim, C., Uerz, T., Corporate foresight in Europe: from trend based logics to open foresight (2008) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 20 (3), pp. 321-336; Groddeck, V., Schwarz, J.O., Perceiving megatrends as empty signifiers: a discourse-theoretical interpretation of trend management (2013) Futures; Harris, D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals, detecting the next big thing (2002) The futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-2129; Heijden, K., (1997), Scenarios, Strategies, and the Strategy Process.

FTA practitioners have used frequently one or a suitable mixture of these methods for their activities. Changing policy and strategy making contexts as well as enabling technologies increased the need and possibility for performing adaptive Foresight studies in order to improve decision making about the future and using making better use of limited resources. This study performs a scientometric analysis of the publications in the major FTA journals with the aim of understanding the dynamics of using Foresight methods across time. Among the other branches of FTA, including forecasting, futures, and technology assessment, a special emphasis is given on Foresight as a systematic and inclusive way of exploring long term futures, developing visions and formulating policies for action. The study aims at detecting the key Trends and Weak Signals regarding the use of existing methods and emerging ones with potential uses for Foresight activities. Further implications will be achieved with the generation of networks for quantitative and qualitative methods. This will demonstrate the most frequently combined Foresight methods by researchers and practitioners. Where possible the methods will also be cross-fertilised with the key thematic areas to illustrate the relationships between policy domains and industrial sectors covered by the scope of study with methodological choice. This output is considered to be taken as a methodological guide for any researchers, practitioners or policy makers, who might embark upon or involved in a Foresight activity. Further outputs of the study will include the identification of centres of excellence in the use of Foresight methods and collaboration networks between countries, institutions and policy domains. Overall, the paper demonstrates how scientometric tools can be used to understand the dynamics of evolution in a research field. Thus, it provides an overview of the use of methods in Foresight, and how it is distinguished from the other FTA activities; the evolutionary characteristics of methodological design and factors influencing the choice of methods; and finally a discussion on the future potentials for new cutting-edge approaches. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Foresight; Foresight methods; FTA; Scientometrics",,,,,,"(2009) Mapping Foresight: revealing how Europe and other world regions navigate into the future, European Foresight Monitoring Network (EFMN), , European Commission, Brussels; Hess, D.J., (1997) Science studies: An advanced introduction, , New York University Press, New York; Keller, J., von der Gracht, H.A., The influence of information and communication technology (ICT) on future Foresight process—Results from a Delphi survey (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 85, pp. 81-92; www.cgee.org.br/atividades/redirKori/290, Miles, I., & Keenan, M.

In both of these examples, social media played a key role in group formation and organization, and in the coordination of the group's subsequent collective actions (i.e., the move from rhetoric to action). Surprisingly, despite its clear importance, little is understood about the factors that lead to this kind of group development and the transition to collective action. This paper focuses on an approach to the analysis of data from social media to detect weak signals, i.e., indicators that initially appear at the fringes, but are, in fact, early indicators of such large-scale real-world phenomena. Our approach is in contrast to existing research which focuses on analysing major themes, i.e., the strong signals, prevalent in a social network at a particular point in time. Analysis of weak signals can provide interesting possibilities for forecasting, with online user-generated content being used to identify and anticipate possible offline future events. We demonstrate our approach through analysis of tweets collected during the London riots in 2011 and use of our weak signals to predict tipping points in that context. © 2015 ACM.","Collective action; Content analysis; Early detection; Forecasting; London riots; Social media; Twitter; Weak signals","Forecasting; Signal detection; Collective action; Content analysis; London riots; Social media; Twitter; Weak signals; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Forsyth, D.R., (2009) Group Dynamics, , Wadsworth/Cengage; Diani, M., McAdam, D., (2003) Social Movements and Networks: Relational Approaches to Collective Action, , ser.

However, due to the increasing turbulence and dynamic complexity that characterize today’s competitive arenas, such systems need to be combined with simulation-based methodologies in order to improve entrepreneurial learning processes and, as a result, better detect possible crisis symptoms and weak signals of change—emerging from the business environment—to promptly react. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to show how a combination of traditional management control mechanisms with system dynamics modelling can effectively lead to better results in terms of SMEs’ performance measurement and management. As a result, a Dynamic Performance Management approach will be illustrated and discussed, also through an empirical application to a real small business. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Case-study; Dynamic Performance Management; Management control; Simulation; SMEs; System dynamics modelling",,,,,,"Bianchi, C., Introducing SD modeling into planning & control systems to manage SMEs growth: A learning-oriented perspective.

The theory postulates a set of technologies and practices that are unique to each wave. Although a challenge of the Kondratieff wave theory is great variance in interpretations about the timing of the waves among scholars, based on several analyses we suggest that with the financial crisis of 2008, and resulting economic instability, we are experiencing the end of the fifth wave and the emergence of the sixth. We take as our starting point the global trends, particularly those of scarcity and the rising cost of commodities such as energy and raw materials that have led to a widely shared hypothesis that resource productivity will be the key driver of technology and economic growth in the next wave. Socially, this driver will be fortified by growing environmental concerns since climate change and the destruction of natural ecosystems seem inevitably to proceed. Both these sources are boosting a generation of new companies and behaviour. In this article our focus is to evaluate weak signals that point to possible directions for the future of organisational practices in the sixth Kondratieff wave. We ask what will be the effects of the changing socio-technical landscape on the working life and organisational culture. The K-waves theory explains how certain ways of organising that have so far developed in the fringes of organisational culture may move into the mainstream, as a product of the systemic restructuring that has often accompanied the new K-wave. We present our findings from a workshop with representatives of five different resource efficiency oriented organisations in the Silicon Valley area. Based on the data we have gathered through the workshop and complementing interviews, we show how organisations base their considerations about the future to a surprisingly large extent on ethical arguments. Our material also includes a case that shows that this ethical approach is not self-evidently related to the aim for resource efficiency. We evaluate our results in the Future Sign - framework presented by Hiltunen. The signals we have gathered are combined with corporate shared value - thinking, and both are interpreted through the Kondratieff - wave theory. Based on our sample of five cases, along with a framework that supports our interpretation, we suggest the ethical motivations as backbone of organisations is a relatively strong future sign that has potential for strengthening in the sixth wave context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethics; Future sign; Kondratieff waves; Resource efficiency; Sixth wave; Social change","economic growth; economic instability; economic theory; ethics; future prospect; socioeconomic conditions; technological development; theoretical study",,,,,"(2014), http://www.ge.com/about-us/ecomagination, See; (2014), http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/, See; (2014), http://rt.com/usa/google-billion-solar-power-457/, See; (2014), http://www.givesomethingback.com/; (2014), http://www.newleafpaper.com/; (2014), http://www.shareable.net/; (2014), https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome; (2014), http://www.vinestove.com/; Arthur, W.B., The second economy (2011) McKinsey Quarterly, , https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/The_second_economy_2853; Ayres, R.U., Technological transformations long waves part I (1990) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 36, pp. 111-137; Ayres, R.U., Technological transformations long waves part II (1990) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 37, pp. 1-37; Barnosky, A.D., Hadly, E.A., Bascompte, J., Berlow, E.L., Brown, J.H., Fortelius, M., Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere (2012) Nature, 486, pp. 52-58; Braudel, F., (1996) The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II, , University of California Press, Berkeley; Brynjolfsson, E., McAfee, A., (2011) Race against the machine: How the digital revolution is accelerating innovation, driving productivity, and irreversibly transforming employment and the economy, , Digital Frontier Press, Lexington, Mass; Dator, J., From tsunamis to long waves and back (1999) Futures, 31 (1); Dator, J., Alternative futures for K-waves (2006) Kondratieff waves, warfare and world security, pp. 311-317. , IOS Press, Amsterdam, T.C.

Furthermore, we analyze whether internal experts (experts employed with firms) and external experts (e.g., consultants) differ in the importance they attribute to signals as predictors of technological discontinuities. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset obtained from a conjoint analysis conducted with 29 experts in the ICT industry. The conjoint approach allows for a simulation of the forecasting process and considers utility trade-offs. The results show that for both types of experts the perceived benefit of users most highly contributes to predicting technological discontinuities. Internal experts assign more importance to legal frameworks (e.g., standards) as signals helping them to predict technological discontinuities than external experts. The latter, in turn, assign more importance to profit margins and the recombination potential of technologies than their internal counterparts. Our results add important insights to the literature on R&D and innovation management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Existing approaches for identifying weak signals in strategic decision making use environmental scanning procedures based on standard filtering algorithms. These algorithms discard patterns with low information content; however, they are not able to discard patterns with low relevance to a given strategic problem. Idea mining is proposed as an algorithm that identifies relevant textual patterns from documents or websites to solve a given (strategic) problem. Thus, it enables to estimate patterns' relevance to the given strategic problem. The provided new methodology that combines weak signal analysis and idea mining is in contrast to existing methodologies. In a case study, a web-based scanning procedure is implemented to identify textual internet data in the field of self-sufficient energy supply. Idea mining is applied for filtering and weak signals are identified based on the proposed approach. The proposed approach is compared to a further - already evaluated - approach processed without using idea mining. The results show that idea mining filtering improves quality of weak signal analysis. This supports decision makers by providing early and suggestive signals of potentially emerging trends, even with only little expressive strength. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Idea mining; Strategic decision making;

Main objective of the manuscript was identification of functional and non-functional requirements for optimized corporate foresight system resulting from a foresight study simulating corporate foresight and previous experience with existing foresight trend database.","Analytical tools; Content analysis; Corporate foresight; Horizon scanning; Weak signal","Database systems; Information systems; Management information systems; Planning; Strategic planning; Analytical tool; Content analysis; Corporate foresight; Horizon scanning; Weak signals; Information management",,,,,"Carbonara, G., Caiazza, R., How to turn crisis into opportunity: Perception and reaction to high level of uncertainty in banking industry (2010) Foresight: The Journal of Futures Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 12 (4), pp. 37-46; Dasgupta, S., Sanyal, D., Bridge to the future: Connect your strategies in an interconnected world (2009) Foresight: The Journal of Futures Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 11 (1), pp. 81-93; De Moor, K., Saritas, O., Innovation foresight for living labs (2009) Yeditepe International Research Conference on Foresight 2009 (YIRCoF '09), , Abstracts, Istanbul; (2014) IScan, , http://wiwe.iknowfutures.eu/scan/advanced, [cited 2014-10-2]; Keller, J., Markmann, C., Von Der Gracht, H.A., Foresight support systems to facilitate regional innovations: A conceptualization case for a german logistics cluster (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change; Kovarikova, L., Grosova, S., Benefits of computer based content analysis to foresight (2014) Trends Economics and Management, 8 (18), pp. 33-43; KPMG, (2013) Food and Beverage Industry Outlook Survey, , https://www.kpmg.com/US/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/foodbeverage-outlook-survey-2013.pdf, cited 2013-12-27; Markmann, C., Trend database design for effectively managing foresight knowledge - A sophisticated FTA content base architecture to enable foresight processes (2011) Forth International Seville Conference on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis (FTA), FTA and Grand Societal Challenges - Shaping and Driving Structural and Systematic Transformations, , Seville; Masum, H., Ranck, J., Singer, P.A., Five promising methods for health foresight (2010) Foresight: The Journal of Futures Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 12 (1), pp. 54-66; Neuendorf, K.A., (2002) The Content Analysis Guidebook, , Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications; Pang, A.S.-K., Futures 2.0: Rethinking the discipline (2010) Foresight: The Journal of Futures Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 12 (1), pp. 5-20; Popper, R., (2010) Evaluating Foresight, , Santiago de Cali: Universidad del Valle; Rohrbeck, R., (2011) Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm, , Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Rohrbeck, R., Gemünden, H., Corporate foresight: Its three roles in enhancing the innovation capacity of a firm (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (2), pp. 231-243",,"Nemec R.Zapletal F.","","VSB-Technical University of Ostrava","11th International Conference on Strategic Management and Its Support by Information Systems 2015, SMSIS 2015","21 May 2015 through 22 May 2015",,112493,,9788024837413,,,"English","Proc.

Many techniques are used like opinion mining, event detection and foresight studies. Foresight allows studying the future and tries to predict and anticipate future actions. We can find diverse concepts and methodologies with numerous challenging research topics: trends, weak signals, wild cards⋯ This paper will focus on weak signal detection in which we try to find the early warning signs in a performed quantitative and automatic way. It will present a literature review regarding the weak signals analysis terminology along with the processes to detect these signals, techniques, methods and approaches used.","Competitive intelligence; Early warning signs; Foresight; Weak signals","Competition; Competitive intelligence; Economics; Information management; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Business environments; Early warning signs; Event detection; Foresight; Literature reviews; Research topics; Weak signal detection; Weak signals; Signal detection",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Kirsch, W., Roventa, P., Dispersed positioning in portfolio analysis (1982) Industrial Marketing Management, 11 (4), pp. 237-252; Butter, M., (2010) Scanning for Early Recognition of Emerging Issues; Dealing with the Unexpected, an Operational Framework for the Identification and Assessment of New Future Developments, , Brussels: s.n; Coffman, B.S., (1997) Weak Signal Research, Part I: Introduction, , s.l.: Journal of Transition Management; Coffman, B.S., (1997) Weak Signal Research, Part V: A Process Model for Weak Signal Research, , s.l.: Journal of Transition Management; Colakoglu, T., The problematic of competitive intelligence: How to evaluate& develop competitive intelligence?

Weak signals, also conceptualised as trends, can be considered the most relevant input for developing foresight in an organisation. While detecting weak signals has traditionally relied on the news media, cultural products such as literature, movies, art, or computer games appear to have been neglected in the practice of foresight.However, literary genres such as novels can be a valuable source for developing foresight. Literature can be characterised as delivering ""thick descriptions"". Not only do novels describe social practices, but from them the reader also gains, for instance, deep insights into the feelings and emotions of the characters.These thick descriptions are even more interesting in the context of foresight when one considers that these descriptions play a role in the construction of social reality and therefore can influence, over time, reality, or rather translate fiction into fact. It can be argued that the new departs from cultural products, before translating into widely accepted social practices or mass-market products. The value of using literature in foresight also appears to be related to the notion that these narratives can be read as scenarios, revealing the potential of literature. Because of their narrative structure, these scenarios can overcome cognitive barriers in the development of foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cultural products; Foresight; Narratives; Trends","Computer games; Signal detection; Cultural products; Foresight; Market products; Narrative structures; Narratives; Social practices; Social reality; Trends; Translation (languages); conceptual framework; culture; organizational framework; trend analysis",,,,,"Liebl, F., Schwarz, J.O., Normality of the future: trend diagnosis for strategic foresight (2010) Futures, 42 (4), pp. 313-327; Liebl, F., The anatomy of complex societal problems and its implications for OR (2002) J.

Anticipating such changes can however be difficult given the profusion and complexity of data and when signals indicating future risks and opportunities may be weak. To tackle this challenge, the French Environment ministry asked a research team at AgroParisTech to develop a new method for identifying emerging issues for biodiversity policies by 2020 in France (except for overseas territories). This project, called BioPIQuE 2013, involved both scientists and stakeholders in an interdisciplinary assessment. As a result, 25 emerging issues were identified, among which 10 issues were highlighted for their strategic interest. A majority of these issues are current trends not yet taken into account by biodiversity policies (such as ""why do we have to and how can we improve our ability to restore-with ambitious biodiversity objectives-urbanised and highly degraded areas?""), and a few of them are weak signals (such as ""how can we deal with trade-offs and conflicts between biodiversity policies and other environmental policies?""). All stakeholders, including researchers, NGOs, public administrations, private companies and politicians, can find in the results some inputs for developing their biodiversity conservation strategies. © NSS-Dialogues, EDP Sciences 2015.","Biodiversity; Emerging issues; Futures studies; Institutional arrangements; Public policies","biodiversity; conservation planning; environmental policy; institutional framework; interdisciplinary approach; strategic approach; France",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Könnölä, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., Van, R.V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39, pp. 208-221; Belna, K., Leménager, T., Mermet, L., Évaluer l'efficacité de politiques et programmes environnementaux: quel cadrage proposer Le cas du Fonds de partenariat pour le carbone forestier (2012) Notes Méthodologiques N 5, Agence Française de Développement., , http://www.afd.fr/webdav/site/afd/shared/PUBLICATIONS/RECHERCHE/Evaluations/Notes-methodologiques/05-notes-methodologiques.pdf; Chateauraynaud, F., Les lanceurs d'alerte dans l'espace politique.

An important aspect within the innovation process, is technology planning. The Heinz Nixdorf Institute developed a technology planning concept, which is supported by an Innovation-Database. The Innovation-Database synchronizes aspects from the market pull and the technology push. Furthermore, it is used as a knowledge management system for innovations and technologies. The challenge is filling the technology pool with a minimum set of technologies in order to use the whole functionality of the Innovation-Database. Many resources are needed in order to fill the technology pool or to update it. There is in increase in information in the World Wide Web and most of the information is fuzzy. Our approach is to identify them automatically by using crawler technologies. Therefore a software tool was developed, which automatically crawls for technologies in the database of the European Patent Office and in the journal database IEEE Xplore. In these data sources, the tool identifies technologies automatically in natural texts, prepares the data and visualize them. It is not suitable to scan a text for a defined set of technologies in a dictionary, because then the tool is not able to find new technologies or to detect weak signals. In this paper, the architecture and features of the software tool is described. It uses text mining methods to detect technologies in unstructured, fuzzy data. As input data, the user has to provide a search field, which the search is performed for. Furthermore, the data sources have to be defined. The tool crawls these data sources in order to identify technologies, which can be relevant for a given search field. The tool suggests newly identified technologies for the search field, which are generally relevant. The user has to decide whether those technologies are important for him. This information is used as feedback for the text-mining model to improve the precision of future analyses. In order to support the user, a suggested technology is automatically provided with further information, like a description and an estimation of technological maturity. With this information a user can start an evaluation of the technology. For every technology a datasheet is created with detail information. It can easily be customized for specific demands. All technologies can be visualized on a radar. The radar shows all technologies for a search field according to its relevance. These information is used for strategic product and technology planning.

The proposed antenna consists of vertical lines and multiple horizontal lines that are also used as defroster lines. The proposed antenna structure is optimized with the genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction with the FEKO EM simulator. The optimized antenna was built and installed on an Azera test vehicle (Korean model: TG Grandure 270) from Hyundai-Kia Motors and antenna performances such as reflection coefficients, and bore-sight gain are measured in an anechoic chamber. The optimized antenna shows a half power matching bandwidth of 26 % at the center frequency of the FM radio band and an average boresight gain of about -10.37 dBi. Then, we performed a field test to measure actual received power of FM radio signals. The field test result shows that the proposed antenna is capable of maintaining higher received power levels compared to the conventional antenna for both the strong and weak signals in the real urban situation. © 2015, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","FM antennas; Glass-integrated antennas; Vehicle antennas","Frequency modulation; Genetic algorithms; Glass; Radio receivers; Receiving antennas; Antenna performance; Antenna structures; Center frequency; FM antennas; FM radio signals; Glass-integrated antennas; Received Power Levels; Vehicle antennas; Antennas",,,,,"Abou-Jaoude, R., Walton, E.K., Numerical modeling of on-glass conformal automobile antennas (1998) IEEE Trans.

While companies are compelled to manage exploration projects, the processes underlying the expansion of knowledge in these projects are not well known. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the literature, this paper first presents a conceptual view of the notion of expert. Then, the research question is analyzed by means of a case study of a polar expedition. The project leader seeks a knowledgeable person who has never been identified as an expert, but whose knowledge is essential. Findings – The expert appears both in his cognitive and social dimensions. Moreover, he emerges out of the situation, on the basis of neither strong nor weak signals. The rationality of expert solicitation falls within a pragmatic logic where the acquired knowledge must reduce the uncertainty so that the project can progress. The learning process enables to increase gradually the knowledge of the actor but also to build the legitimacy required in order to have access to the expert. Practical implications – Findings can be translated in more general situations. Indeed, polar expeditions projects and exploratory innovation projects (Garel and Lièvre, 2010) possess some common characteristics: lack of knowledge concerning, timing issues, need to implement a pragmatic, enquiry-based learning. These projects strongly rely on external expert knowledge. This case study suggests that, while it may be useful, planning should not strictly define the course of action. A central competence of the project leader is to manage the duality between planning and adaptation. This implies the ability to adapt, to detect and to assess human resources and knowledge flows rapidly, as well as to weave social links inside and outside the organisation. Originality/value – The existing literature offers a comprehensive view of experts in an organisation. However, the questions of expert selection and identification remain open. This paper fills a gap in the literature concerning the way experts are identified and selected. The case study shows that identifying experts does not solely depend on weak signals (reputation) or on strong signals (the expert’s social status). Rather, the expert emerges in the situation, in an unexpected way. The expert’s social dimension is not sufficient and one must look to the cognitive roots of the expertise. On the other hand, the fact is emphasised that the expert is a social construct which emerges from the solicitation process. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Experts; Knowledge; Learning; Project management; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Amin, A., Cohendet, P., (2004) Architectures of Knowledge, Firms, Communities and Competencies, , andOxford University Press, Oxford:; Ancori, B., Expertise et citoyenneté: les Grecs anciens et nous (2009) Revue d’anthropologie des connaissances, 3 (1), pp. 485-529. , , Vol.No., pp; Belleval, C., Deniaud, I., Lerch, C., A model for the management of design project issues: the case of the microsatellites design (2010) International Journal of Design and Innovation Research, 5 (1). , and, Vol.No; Ben Mahmoud-Jouini, S., Charue-Duboc, F., Enhancing discontinuous innovation through knowledge combination: the case of an exploratory unit within an established automotive firm (2008) Creativity and Innovation Management, 17 (2), pp. 127-135. , and, Vol.No., pp; Bootz, J.P., Schenk, E., Comment gérer les experts au sein et en dehors des communautés?

Such questions arise particularly when it comes down to making strategic decisions. To help with these questions, this book defines the concept of the ""weak signal"" and then demonstrates how it would be useful in relation to strategic decisions, and more precisely in relation to three moments of the strategic decision, i.e.: - The trigger of the strategic decision (what is the trigger, why and when) - The development of the strategic decision - The implementation of the strategic decision. © ISTE Ltd 2014.

It enables to predict the appearance of events in advance that are relevant for an organization. An example is to predict the appearance of a new and relevant technology for a research organization. Existing approaches detect weak signals based on an environmental scanning procedure that considers textual information from the internet. This is because about 80% of all data in the internet are textual information. The texts are processed by a specific clustering approach where clusters that represent weak signals are identified. In contrast to these related approaches, we propose a new methodology that investigates a sequence of clusters measured at successive points in time. This enables to trace the development of weak signals over time and thus, it enables to identify relevant weak signal developments for organization's decision making in strategic early warning environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Since such a setting enhances creativity and perception, it has been identified as a means to develop new products, services, and business models. Novelty starts with weak signals of change within an environment and leads to innovations. From a constructivist perspective, in which knowledge needs to be processed or ""constructed"", weak signals of change are not perceived by the outside environment. Rather, they have to be conceptualized in a cognitive process. We use this theoretical perspective to illustrate the value of novels in identifying and cognitively conceptualizing weak signals. With the support of sense-making theory, we illustrate how novels contribute to comprehending novelty in two frames of reference: by broadening the perspective, enhancing the creativity, and increasing the sensitivity of managers/corporate decision makers to detect weak signals; and by ensuring that the customer comprehends the link of an SF prototype to a future product or service. Our theoretical considerations are illustrated by an example from the novel, Super Sad True Love Story, in which the SF prototype is part of a broader fictional story. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Frames of reference; Novels; Science fiction prototyping; Sense-making; Trend; Weak signals","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Frames of reference; Novels; Science fictions; Sensemaking; Trend; Weak signals; Decision theory; cognition; decision making; innovation; research; science and technology; trend analysis",,,,,"Harris, S.D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals: detecting the next big thing (2002) Futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-28; Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

Some of the most urgent challenges facing those responsible for improving and regulating patient safety are therefore how to identify, interpret, integrate and act on the early warnings and weak signals of emerging risks - before those risks contribute to a disastrous failure of care. These challenges are fundamentally organisational and cultural: they relate to what information is routinely noticed, communicated and attended to within and between healthcare organisations - and, most critically, what is assumed and ignored. Analysing these organisational and cultural challenges suggests three practical ways that healthcare organisations and their regulators can improve safety and address emerging risks. First, engage in practices that actively produce and amplify fleeting signs of ignorance. Second, work to continually define and update a set of specific fears of failure. And third, routinely uncover and publicly circulate knowledge on the sources of systemic risks to patient safety and the improvements required to address them.",,"disaster medicine; disaster planning; health care organization; health care quality; human; knowledge; learning; patient safety; review",,,,,"(2009) Investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, , Healthcare Commission.

These firms that were once quality leaders can no longer compete on the quality of their products or services. This research develops a theoretical understanding of how organizations can sustain a quality advantage. It offers a conceptual definition of sustaining a quality advantage which involves not only sustaining a high level of quality performance, but also sustaining a high consistency of quality performance. A comparative case study provides evidence of three capabilities that distinguish firms with different levels of sustaining quality. These capabilities include: (1) meta-learning, (2) sensing weak signals, and (3) resilience to quality disruptions. The case analysis argues that meta-learning helps sustain a high level of quality performance, while sensing weak signals and resilience improves the consistency of quality performance. This study offers a dynamic capability-based strategy that explains how to sustain a competitive advantage in quality, which may also have implications for sustaining other operational competitive advantages. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we consider instead informal and unobservable networks. The paper explores how hidden informal exchanges can impact upon organisational decision-making and performance, particularly around inter-agency working, as knowledge distributed across organisations and shared between organisations is often shared through informal means and not captured effectively through the formal decision-making processes. Early warnings and weak signals about potential risks and crises are therefore often missed. We consider the implications of these dynamics in terms of crisis avoidance and crisis management. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","control; crisis; informal networks; organisational performance; risk",,,,,,"Ackroyd, S., Thompson, P., (1999) Organizational Misbehaviour, , London, SAGE; Argyris, C., (1990) Overcoming Organizational Defences.

GPS jamming is an issue in defense and the corporate sector who are satellite-based navigation dependent for their day to day operations. GPS satellites network provides precise location information of all places globally, is widely used for asset tracking by corporates. GPS is vulnerable to jamming, due to its sensitive receivers as they receive very weak signals from satellites. In this study, a novel optimization method based on the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for the interference cancellation design is proposed which maximizes gain towards the desired signal and also improve jamming rejection performance. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

Design/methodology/approach – An example of mapping and identifying expectations is presented as a result of a thematic analysis of qualitative interview data, collected from six stakeholder groups of the media industry. Findings – Expectation types and gaps can be identified through the use of systematic expectation mapping, conceptualized in this paper as “expectation management.” Expectation management analyzes expectation types and priorities, and it assists in crafting response strategies. Four types of expectations (must, will, should, and could) were identified in an empirical study of the media industry. Research limitations/implications – As the empirical study focussed on one industry in one country, the findings should be considered an introduction to expectation mapping and expectation management, to be further developed in other settings. Practical implications – Organizations can gain strategic advantages by using expectation management to deepen communication management. New skills and processes may be needed to enable communication professionals to analyze and understand the core level of expectations. Social implications – Expectation management can help organizations respond to current societal pressures and help publics voice their concerns toward organizations. Originality/value – A new concept with strategic value is presented. The reported study of mapping and identifying expectations helps to clarity and interpret factors that shape stakeholder relationships and satisfaction on a deeper level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Expectation management; Expectations; Public relations theory; Weak signals",,,,,,"Boulding, W., Kalra, A., Staelin, R., Zeithaml, V.A., A dynamic process model of service quality: From expectations to behavioral intentions (1993) Journal of Marketing Research, 30 (1), pp. 7-27; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Brønn, P.S., Adapting the PZB service quality model to reputation risk analysis and the implications for CSR communication (2012) Journal of Communication Management, 16 (1), pp. 77-91; Burgoon, J.K., Interpersonal expectations, expectancy violations, and emotional communication (1993) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 12 (1-2), pp. 30-48; Chung, J.Y., Examining the legitimacy gap in issues management applying expectancy violation theory (2009) Proceedings of the 12th annual International Public Relations Research Conference, pp. 101-119. , Yamamura, K.

At least one cultural factor was a root cause alongside process safety management failures in ten of the most recent incidents investigated by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board. What do leaders need to do to ensure their culture fully supports process safety excellence? This presentation covers the four basic leadership competencies essential to success in process safety. These competencies are: 1. Have the conviction to lead safety. Process safety leaders with a strong personal value for safety can navigate their teams through the noise that might otherwise create complacency or desensitization. 2. Understand how process safety works. Effective process safety leaders continually discuss exposure and risk and use metrics to provide feedback to their teams. A leader doesn't need to be an expert on safety, but she does need to know enough to detect patterns, assess information, and ask the right questions. 3. Possess and practice great leadership skills. Effective safety leaders share common practices such as vision, credibility, communication, collaboration, feedback, action orientation, and accountability. What leaders emphasize and reinforce determines how people respond to events, how they make decisions, and whether they carry out the objectives of the organization. 4. Have the ability to influence people. Great leaders use a transformational style to engage people in the work. Process safety leaders must enable people to do the things that execute process safety systems reliably, detect weak signals, question assumptions, and intervene when necessary.

However, these concepts often go unused in practice. The 2008/2009 economic crisis provided a strong, ongoing impulse for redesigning such information systems (IS). This article develops six guidelines for the conceptual design of environmental scanning systems that are more applicable than those specified by previous research. We start with literature research, which reveals three gaps in existing approaches. Then we develop design guidelines to fill these gaps with the help of ""modern"" IS. To address the lack of sound requirements analysis, our first design principle proposes 360-degree environmental scanning systems for executives and suggests how to select the most important scanning areas. Three further findings cover weaknesses in the IS model perspective, focusing on more effective implications of weak signals. In terms of method, we propose incorporating scanning results more closely into executives' decision-making processes. Applying the design guidelines at a raw materials and engineering company, we arrive at a prototype we call the ""corporate radar."" It includes an IS-based tree with economic value added at risk on top. The resulting lessons learned help to evaluate our findings and the research method presented here, as well provide concrete starting points for future research. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","""Modern"" information system technology;

In particular, risks associated with global supply chains are special since they involve a multitude of international stakeholders with different perspectives on security needs and measures. Therefore, it is essential to determine which techniques and instruments are best suited for risk assessment in complex and multi-organizational environments. The Delphi expert survey technique has proven to be a valuable instrument for long-term decision making support as well as foresight, and has a potential value for risk assessment. We contribute to this research strand and conduct a Delphi-based risk analysis. Our research concentrates on man-made risks in global supply chains which are particularly uncertain in terms of type, location, and affected supply chain partners and can therefore be classified as inherently ""wicked"" issues, i.e. issues that are multidimensional with often unpleasant outcomes. We illustrate that Delphi research makes a fivefold contribution to risk analysis by: (1) identifying and quantifying risks; (2) analyzing stakeholder perceptions and worldviews; (3) stimulating a global communication process; (4) identifying weak signals, outlier opinions, and wildcards; (5) and facilitating risk scenario development. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Risk; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks","Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks; Communication; Research; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Supply chains; Risk analysis; decision making; Delphi analysis; future prospect; perception; risk assessment; stakeholder; terrorism",,,,,"Thun, J.-H., Hoenig, D., An empirical analysis of supply chain risk management in the German automotive industry (2011) Int.

In foresight studies, usually their positive impact on the quality of life is considered or their negative environmental effects. This paper seeks to draw attention to an overlooked ""dark side"" of new technologies: their potential abuse by terrorists or organized crime. Recent cybercrime events are examples of abuse that perhaps could have been minimized if appropriate foresight studies were performed years ago. This was the aim of the recently completed EU-funded project FESTOS. Design/methodology/approach: Several foresight methodologies were employed. Following a horizon scanning for potentially threatening technologies, a Delphi-type expert survey helped to evaluate critical threat characteristics of selected 33 technologies: the likelihood that each technology will actually come to pose a security threat (in different time frames), the easiness of its malicious use, the severity of the threat, and the most threatened societal spheres. Findings: The results enabled ranking the technologies by their ""abuse potential"" and ""threat intensity"". Certain emerging technologies (or their combinations), regarded as ""weak signals"", inspired ideas for potential ""wild cards"". In a subsequent workshop, which employed a variant of the ""futures wheel"" method, four wild-card ""scenario sketches"" were constructed. These were later developed to full narrative scenarios. Originality/value: The entire process enables the introduction of security foresight into policy planning in a long-range perspective. The foresight results were followed by the evaluation of policy implications and coping with the knowledge control dilemma. The paper illustrates how a mix of foresight methods can help in a continuous analysis of new and threats posed by emerging technologies, thus raising awareness of decision makers and mitigating the risk of unforeseen surprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Emerging technologies; Foresight; Future threats; Security; Signals of change; Wild cards",,,,,,"Auffermann, B., Luoto, L., (2011) Integrated Security Threats Report, FESTOS Deliverable D3.3, , http://tinyurl.com/9auvja8, partners with contribution from all, available at; Brown, J., Isaacs, D., (2005) The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter, , Berrett-Koehler, San Francisco, CA; Dienel, H.L., Peperhove, R., (2011), Final Scenario and Indicators Report, FESTOS Deliverable D4.3; Glenn, J.C., (2009) The Futures Wheel, in Futures Research Methodology - V3.0, , Glenn, J.C., Gordon, T.J.

Our system combines structural and semantic information from a real corporate database of monitored activity on their users' computers to detect independently developed red team inserts of malicious insider activities. We have developed and applied multiple algorithms for anomaly detection based on suspected scenarios of malicious insider behavior, indicators of unusual activities, high-dimensional statistical patterns, temporal sequences, and normal graph evolution. Algorithms and representations for dynamic graph processing provide the ability to scale as needed for enterprise-level deployments on real-Time data streams. We have also developed a visual language for specifying combinations of features, baselines, peer groups, time periods, and algorithms to detect anomalies suggestive of instances of insider threat behavior. We defined over 100 data features in seven categories based on approximately 5.5 million actions per day from approximately 5,500 users. We have achieved area under the ROC curve values of up to 0.979 and lift values of 65 on the top 50 user-days identified on two months of real data.

Experiences from a foresight project exploring future innovation patterns (www.innovation-futures.org) are discussed. Four specific features were applied in order to underpin the recognition of structural transformation:.Inductive foresight approach with an emphasis on capturing indications for extra-systemic change at a micro level instead of extrapolating seemingly dominant macro-trends. Visual inspiration, to mobilise tacit knowledge, support a creative spirit and an easy exchange of ideas among people with different disciplinary backgrounds. Rigorous assessment of coverage of dimensions of change, to foster the explicit consideration of possibly unrecognised/hidden structural changes. Extended openness for diversity, to avoid the exclusive interpretation of weak signals only in the context of the existing structures. The findings of the project indicate interesting changes in the nexus of innovation demand and innovation supply. A wide variety of hybrid value creation models with novel configurations of innovation actors emerged. We explain the approach and findings of the project and discuss in particular the implications for foresight methodology. We argue that all four innovative methodological features contributed in a specific way to opening up new perspectives on the future of innovation and potential structural transformation of innovation processes. © 2012.","Foresight methodology; Inductive approach; Innovation pattern; Scenarios; Structural transformation; Vision; Visualisation; Weak signals","Foresight methodology; Inductive approach; Innovation patterns; Scenarios; Structural transformation; Weak signals; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Vision; Visualization; Knowledge management; innovation; knowledge; structural change",,,,,"Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) Tech.

While the relevance of dealing with trends is constantly underlined, the effects of labeling phenomena as trends and megatrends in an organizational context have not been widely discussed. In particular, the dangers of dealing with megatrend semantics are that the strategic implications of these phenomena are unclear and that an organization is likely to increase its blind spots, thereby actually undermining its foresight capability.This paper applies a discourse-theoretical perspective developed by Ernesto Laclau and Chantalle Mouffe to trend management in organizations. It argues that megatrends can be perceived as empty signifiers, as they provide an overdetermined, abstract form of meaning that addresses discourses but cannot convey concrete meaning for management. It is proposed that instead of concentrating on megatrends (empty signifiers), trend management should reconstruct those elements of a discourse in which shifts of meaning can be observed, detecting and understanding the nodal points of a discourse. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Discourse theory; Empty signifier; Megatrends; Nodal points; Trends","detection method; management; organizational framework; strategic approach; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic response in turbulent environments (1982) Working Paper no 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision-making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21, pp. 307-320; Martinet, A.-C., Strategic planning, strategic management, strategic foresight: the seminal work of H.

Yet there were actually early warning signals, but they were often ignored due to a lack of appropriate methodology. Focusing on the concept of a weak signal, this book provides methods for anticipating problems and dealing with blind spots. Along with examples of this concept, the authors provide answers to questions of feasibility, including how to recognize a weak signal, and how to exploit it.

However, just under half of the research studies can be rejected on the grounds that they did not actually test steroids, but compounds or mixtures that were only presumed to behave as steroids (or modulators of steroids) on the basis of their effects in vertebrates (e.g. Bisphenol-A, nonylphenol and sewage treatment effluents). Of the remaining 55 papers, some can be criticized for having no statistical analysis; some for using only a single dose of steroid; others for having irregular dose-response curves; 40 out of the 55 for not replicating the treatments; and 50 out of 55 for having no within-study repetition. Furthermore, most studies had very low effect sizes in comparison to fish-based bioassays for steroids (i.e. they had a very weak 'signal-to-noise' ratio). When these facts are combined with the fact that none of the studies were conducted with rigorous randomization or 'blinding' procedures (implying the possibility of 'operator bias') one must conclude that there is no indisputable bioassay evidence that vertebrate sex steroids have endocrinological or reproductive roles in mollusks. The only observation that has been independently validated is the ability of estradiol to trigger rapid (1-5 min) lysosomal membrane breakdown in hemocytes of Mytilus spp. This is a typical 'inflammatory' response, however, and is not proof that estradiol is a hormone-especially when taken in conjunction with the evidence (discussed in a previous review) that mollusks have neither the enzymes necessary to synthesize vertebrate steroids nor nuclear receptors with which to respond to them. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Key insights and messages are often picked up from one expert group to the next and from one policy domain to another, creating significant spin-off effects. Example of influential approaches include the rupture/disruption theme (picked up by the first SCAR foresight group and elaborated in other European exercises), and the grand challenge approach (flagged by the ERA Rationales group and taken up in the design of Horizon 2020). Transformation by design using policy shocks is being increasingly implemented at European and national level through the use of horizon scanning and detection of wild cards and weak signals of major disruptions underway or on the horizon. FP7 Blue Skies projects focused on refining the tools for identifying wilds cards and weak signals, and on reflecting on their significance in relation to addressing European grand societal challenges. These projects highlighted the need for an ongoing facility at European level to map and detect signals and to understand and analyse the interactions and impacts of such trends and drivers in the European and global context. The establishment of a centralised foresight and scanning facility with the Joint Research Centre central offices in Brussels, and of the European Forum on Forward-looking Activities, can be seen as significant steps that build on the earlier Foresight studies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Konnola, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., Van Rij, V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: Lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Sci Public Policy, 39 (2), pp. 208-221; Cassingena Harper, J., (2002) The Relevance of EU Regional Foresight Experiences for Small Candidate Countries, , Paper prepared for EU HLG on Regional Foresight, April 2002; Cassingena Harper, J., Georghiou, L., The targeted and unforeseen impacts of foresight on innovation policy: The eFORESEE Malta case study (2005) Int J Foresight Innov Policy, 2 (1), pp. 84-103; Cunningham, P., Karakasidou, A., Innovation and societal challenges (2010) Pro Inno Europe Thematic Report No, p. 1; Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: Insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) TASM, 20 (3), pp. 369-387; (2008) Challenging Europe’s Research -Rationales for the European Research Area (ERA, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/pdf/eg7-era-rationales-final-report_en.pdf, report of the ERA Expert Group, EUR 23326 EN.

Literature shows that weak signals can befound in the organization's environment and that they appear indifferent contexts.We use internet information to represent orga- nization 'senvironment and we select these websites that are related to a given hypothesis.In contrast to related research, a methodology is provided that uses latent semantic indexing (LSI) for the identification of weak signals.This improves existing knowledge based approaches because LSI considers the aspects of meaning and thus, it is able to identify similar textual patterns indifferent contexts.A new weak signal maximization approach is introduced that replaces the commonly used prediction modeli ngapproach in LSI. It enables to calculate the largest number of relevant weak signals represented by singular value decomposition (SVD) dimensions.A case study identifies and analyses weak signals to predict trends in the field of on-site medical oxygen production.This supports the planning of research and develop- ment (R&D) for a medical oxygen supplier.As a result, it is shown that the proposed methodology enables organizations to identify weak signals from the internet for a given hypothesis.This helps strategic plan- ners to react ahead of time. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Many futurists are developing foresight of future technologies based on Delphi studies, unfolding history, brainstorming, expert surveys, trend analysis, data mining, and so on. However, formalizing these processes is still a necessary task. In this paper, we introduce the NEST (New and Emerging Signals of Trends) model developed by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI). The NEST collects information from worldwide expert networks and detects the weak signals of emerging future trends systematically, based on massive data analysis, inference techniques, and Delphi studies, to support the development of foresight of future research and technology. The NEST model combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. In the quantitative approach stages, NEST uses clustering, pattern recognition, and cross-impact analysis using a Bayesian network. In the stages of qualitative approaches, NEST conducts environmental scanning, brainstorming, and a Delphi study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bayesian network; Delphi study; Emerging trend; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative analysis; Weak signal","Bayesian analysis; decision making; Delphi analysis; detection method; future prospect; model; quantitative analysis; research and development; science and technology; technology adoption; trend analysis; Korea",,,,,"Zhang, D., Extracting social and community intelligence from digital footprints: an emerging research area (2010) UIC'10 Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, , Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, Xi'an, China; Chen, W., Social network analysis supporting collaborative knowledge building (2009) SOCINFO '09 Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Social Informatics, , IEEE Computer Society; Zhuhadar, L., Visual knowledge representation of conceptual semantic networks (2010) Social Network Anal.

In doing so the paper looks at new generations of ideas; new generations of individualism; and new generations of organisational structures and cultures. Weak signals can already be identified from a century ago indicating new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, psychology and education. These signs of what many regard as evolutionary change in human thinking run parallel with many of the exponential changes manifesting in the external world. The paper argues for a shift beyond egotistic individualism to collective individualism, laying foundations for major organisational transformation to meet the needs of uncertain futures. The paper suggests that futures studies as a field needs to be sensitive to the developmental and paradigmatic changes that have been occurring both within and across the knowledge spectrum. Finally, the World Futures Studies Federation is examined as a case study to determine whether it is, indeed, ahead of its times. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"culture; education; future prospect; individualism; philosophy; psychology; twenty first century",,,,,"Berger, G., (1964) Phénoménologie du temps et prospective, , Presses Universitaires de France, Paris; Adam, B., Groves, C., (2007) Future Matters: Action, Knowledge, Ethics, Supplements to the Study of Time, , Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands; Inayatullah, S., Gidley, J., (2000) The University in Transformation: Global Perspectives on the Futures of the University, , Bergin and Garvey, Westport, CT; Boulding, E., Image and action in peace building (1988) Journal of Social Issues, 44 (2), p. 17; Masini, E., The future of futures studies (1989) Futures, (APRIL), p. 152; Inayatullah, S., Wildman, P., (1998) Futures Studies: Methods, Emerging Issues and Civilizational Visions.

A comparative analysis is provided as well as a brief evaluation the needs of policy-makers if they are to identify areas in which policy needs to be formulated. This paper suggests that the selection of the best scanning approaches and methods is subject to contextual and content issues.

Specifically, anticipatory governance provides a way to use foresight, networks, feedback and hierarchical links for the purpose of reducing risk and increasing the capacity to respond to events at their initial stages of development. In order to deal with acceleration, organizations must acquire a much greater sensitivity to weak signals concerning alternative futures and learn to respond them with increased flexibility and speed.

The need to improve foresight and strengthen the dialogue between foresight, planning, and innovation processes in SMEs is noted. This paper examines what enhances and what hinders the absorption of foresight knowledge in the innovation processes in SMEs. Based on the empirical data gathered by participative observation in 3 workshops and 8 expert interviews, the lack of weak signals or foresight tools are not disincentives. Instead, inherent human features of SMEs seemed to be the main barriers to foreseeing and innovation in Finnish SMEs. © 2012 IEEE.","Foreseeing; Innovation; SMEs","Business environments; Empirical data; Finnish; Foreseeing; Innovation in SMEs; Innovation process; SMEs; Weak signals; Industrial management; Innovation; Industry",,,,,"Atherton, A., Hannon, P., (1995) Thinking about Strategic Awareness Capability, , Small Business centre, Durham University Business School; Melkas, H., Harmaakorpi, V., (2012) Practice-based Innovation: Insights, Applications and Policy Implications.

In this chapter, we argue that organizations that manage unexpected events and prevent small problems from becoming large crises are engaged in important acts of positive organizing. We assume that adverse events, crises, and accidents are not inevitable; rather, they result from small problems, surprises, and lapses that shift, grow, and escalate until they are too big to handle. This chapter focuses on a set of capabilities that allows organizations to contain and repair vulnerability. Specifically, we identify a set of critical capabilities that involve attention, awareness, and action: these include capabilities for attending to, making sense of, and not explaining away discrepancies; capabilities for updating and coordinating understanding as problems unfold; and capabilities for actively managing problems through containment and resilience. We end with avenues for future research and practice. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

Weak signals are defined as imprecise and early indicators of impending important events or trends, which are considered key to formulating new potential business items. However, existing methods for discovering weak signals rely on the knowledge and expertise of experts, whose services are not widely available and tend to be costly. They may even provide different analysis results. Therefore, this paper presents a quantitative method that identifies weak signal topics by exploiting keyword-based text mining. The proposed method is illustrated using Web news articles related to solar cells. As a supportive tool for the expert-based approach, this method can be incorporated into long-term business planning processes to assist experts in identifying potential business items. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: Built upon the concept of the systemic foresight methodology, the Scan-4-Light approach involves the integrated use of horizon scanning, network analysis and evolutionary scenarios combined with expert consultations and workshops. The study identified the emerging trends, issues, weak signals and wild cards; created high-value visualisations to emphasize the results and findings; and produced narratives to increase the impact and awareness of the development issues. Findings: The Scan-4-Light project has resulted in a large number of specific outputs, providing the views of the Searchlight newsletters' contents at various levels of granularity. It has set out to show how the tools used here can be applied to illustrate the relationships among issues, and how these vary across countries and regions over time, and are linked to various stakeholders and possible solutions to problems. Research limitations/implications: Scan-4-Light demonstrates how foresight tools and techniques can be used for the analysis of complex and uncertain issues, such as development and poverty, in a systemic way. Practical implications: The Scan-4-Light approach can be applied in a number of areas for scanning and identifying emerging trends and issues, and understanding the relationships between systems and solutions. Social implications: The paper gives evidence that most of the issues, if not all, related to development are not isolated, but interlinked and interconnected. They require more holistic understanding and intervention with an effective collaboration between stakeholders. Originality/value: A demonstration of a novel scanning approach is presented in the paper. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Development; Forward planning; Horizon scanning; Network analysis; Poverty; Project evaluation; Scenarios; Searchlight",,,,,,"Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., Freeman, L.C., (2002) Ucinet VI for Windows: Software for Social Network Analysis, , Analytic Technologies, Harvard, MA; Ena, O., Mikova, N., Saritas, O., Sokolova, A., A technology trend monitoring methodology: The case of semantic technologies (2012) Technovation, , submitted for publication; Freeman, L.C., Centrality in social networks I: Conceptual clarification (1979) Social Networks, 1, pp. 215-239; Intellecap, Development initiative - rainwater harvesting (2010) Searchlight South Asia - Monthly Newsletter on Trends in Pro-poor Urban Development in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, , Intellecap, New Delhi; Miles, I., Saritas, O., The depth of the horizon: Searching, scanning and widening horizons (2012) Foresight, 14 (6), pp. 530-545; (2008) Millennium Project 2008 State of the Future, , Millennium Project, Washington, DC; (2012), www.millennium-project.org/millennium/challeng.html, available at; Nugroho, Y., Saritas, O., Incorporating network perspectives in foresight: A methodological proposal (2009) Foresight, 11 (6), pp. 530-545; Saritas, O., Systems thinking for foresight (2006), PhD thesis, Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, The University of Manchester, Manchester; Saritas, O., Systemic foresight methodology (2012) Designing and Implementing Future Oriented STI Policy - Potentials and Limits of Foresight Studies, , in Gokhberg, L., Meissner, D. and Sokolov, A.(Eds.), Springer, Berlin; Saritas, O., Miles, I., (2012) Scan-4-Light: A Horizon Scanning/Trend Monitoring Project for the Rockefeller Foundation, , Manchester Institute of Innovation Research; Saritas, O., Nugroho, Y., Mapping issues and envisaging futures: An evolutionary scenario approach (2012) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 79, pp. 509-529; Saritas, O., Smith, J., The big picture - trends, drivers, wild cards, discontinuities and weak signals (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 292-312; Saritas, O., Pace, L.M., Stalpers, S., Stakeholder participation and dialogue in foresight (2010) Exploring the Future: The Role of Interaction in Foresight, pp. 38-71. , in Borch, K., Koutsopoulos, K.

The dilemma caused by their varying definitions led Hiltunen (2008) to introduce the concept of 'future sign', which is based on Peirce's semiotic model of the sign. Hiltunen's conceptual framework is developed further in this paper. The focus of the analysis shifts from single future signs to the signification processes in which the future signs are perceived, interpreted and produced. The idea is that every future-oriented signification process is based on some issue on the agenda. It is a process of learning and acting, focused on the solving of problems related to the issue in question.","Change; CLA; Future sign; Semiotics; Signification process; Weak signal",,,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, I.H., (1982) Strategic response in turbulent environments, , Working Paper, No.82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, August; Ansoff, I.H., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice/Hall International; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Bankov, K., A Sociosemiotic Model (2008) A Sounding of Signs: Modalities and Moments in Music, Culture, and Philosophy, , Robert S.

Design/methodology/approach - The main method applied is critical thinking combined with a review of selected aspects of complexity theory and a general experience of applying foresight. Several new and practical implications for foresight techniques and their application are derived. Promoting variation is examined as one way to make policies more resilient in a complex system. Findings - Complexity science demonstrates that disruptive events do not need an associated trigger, as they are a normal part of a complex system. This insight implies that if we are always looking for weak signals we will certainly be caught unawares. Practical implications - The assumption that disruptive events can be managed by planning and forecasting is not a workable option. Instead, policy making needs to assume that unexpected disruptive events will happen even with the best horizon scanning system in place. Foresight techniques need to be developed to embrace emergence and to provide capabilities such as reframing to visualise systems from very different perspectives, including those considered impossible now. Originality/value - Although neither complexity theory nor the concept of reframing is new in the area of foresight, the derivation of practical implications for foresight techniques is original. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complexity; Complexity theory; Disruptive events; Emergence; Policy making; Reframing; Strategic planning; Uncertainty management; Variation",,,,,,"Axelrod, R., (1985) The Evolution of Cooperation, , Basic Books, New York, NY, reprinted ed; Axelrod, R., Cohen, M., (2001) Harnessing Complexity: Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier, , The Free Press, New York, NY; Battram, A., (2000) Navigating Complexity: The Essential Guide to Complexity Theory in Business and Management, , Spiro Press, London; Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, Volume 1: Human Science for a New Era, , Transaction Publishers, Piscataway, NJ; Bhimji, W., (2009) Guidance on the Use of Strategic Foresight Analysis for Policy Development in Government, , www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/horizon-scanning-centre/futuresinpolicyguidance.pdf, available at (accessed 6 June 2012), UK Government Office for Science, London; Byrne, D., (1998) Complexity Theory and the Social Sciences: An Introduction, , Routledge, New York, NY; Gheorghiou, L., Cassingena Harper, J., Keenan, M., Miles, I., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, pp. 3-23. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Glouberman, S., Zimmerman, B., (2002) Complicated and Complex Systems: What Would Successful Reform of Medicare Look Like?, , Commission on the Future of Healthcare in Canada, Ottawa; Goodwin, B., (1994) How the Leopard Changed Its Spots, , Phoenix, London; Inayatullah, S., Deconstructing and reconstructing the future: Predictive, cultural and critical epistemologies (1990) Futures, 22 (2), pp. 115-141; Mendonça, S., Pine Cunha, M., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 201-218; Mikulecky, C., The emergence of complexity: Science coming of age or science growing old?

We argue that recent futures studies have essentially deepened the analysis of this concept, which originally lacked an accurate definition. Placing weak signals in the general context of futures research has provided the concept with a theoretical point of attachment and linked it with other futures concepts - such as strong signals and trends. Recent studies have also increased the applicability of the concept of weak signals, specifying ways in which signals can be identified, collected and interpreted. Consequently, a number of empirical examples of the analysis of weak signals are nowadays available. In the present paper, we summarize and evaluate both theoretical contributions and managerial implications of these new approaches. While emphasizing the advancements of research, we also want to point out that Ansoff not only was a pioneer in the field, but developed many ideas that are still applicable today. We conclude our paper by suggesting directions for the further development of weak signals research. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"conceptual framework; research; signal",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Californian Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice-Hall International, London; Ansoff, H.I., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes-new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22, pp. 93-111; Coates, J.S., Boom time in forecasting (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 62, pp. 37-40; Irvine, J., Martin, B.R., (1989) Research Foresight.

As a form of foresight raw material, ""weak signals"" can be thought of as gross, unstructured, fragmented, incomplete and inadvertent environmental data that may be refined into valuable information regarding context and further be articulated into strategically actionable knowledge. As advanced indicators that precede significant discrete one-off events and/or novel developments in the rate and direction of trends, their analysis has the potential to facilitate the real-time alignment between organisational decision-making and changing external circumstances. These predictors of future change pose fundamental problems of identification and interpretation and represent a challenge to established mental models. Thus, the practical significance of weak signals is that they can be transformed into meaningful insight for policy action. Such a value, however, does not materialise automatically. Realising this potential requires a degree of tolerance and fluidity of the collective cognitive frameworks by which weak signals can be apprehended, assessed and acted upon.

While providing a broad view and discussing a variety of contributions on this topic, the aim of this article is to offer a more constructivist approach to early detection studies than has been typically the case so far. The article starts by positioning the underlying problem of weak signals within the broader field of futures studies. The second section examines the Ansoffian tradition, first on the basis of Ansoff's own contributions, then through key enhancements offered by scholars working in the same perspective. The third section develops the arguments for a constructivist critique of the Ansoffian tradition as a way to renew and enrich scientific debate. The fourth and final section presents the main open issues where research, case studies, methods and applications still need to make significant progress in the vast domain of weak signal analysis and early detection."" I have never doubted the truth of signs, Adso; they are the only thing man has with which to orient himself in the world. What I did not understand was the relation among signs.""

The response proposed here is that many of the developments identified by efforts to detect and interpret weak signals are the result of designed interventions that define the repertoire of actions and frames. Very often, as Ansoff argued, actors use a variety of models and filters for seeking and using weak signals. Thus weak signals are not only dependent on the interpretative equipment applied by actors, but from a constructivist perspective the identification of and meaning given to weak signals are strongly influenced by design choices made at the outset. In this sense design is a constitutive element of both the environment and signal detection/use. An example of how design is constitutive of both context and understanding can be found in the history of hospital hygiene. This case study illustrates how dominant regimes of practice, established through the conception of pathogen bacteria and antibacterial treatments and disinfection, are now creating signals that call into question fundamental design of hygiene practices. By examining the epistemic assumptions of scientific disciplines and the designed repertoire of practical responses it becomes clear how contexts and frames of interpretation are constituted and how such contexts and frames then define what is recognised as a weak signal. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"design method; disinfection; environmental response; hospital sector; hygiene; modeling; planning method; signal",,,,,"Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Goffman, E., (1974) Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience, , Harper and Row; Bruno, B., (1988) The Pasteurization of France, , Belknap Press; Jørgensen, M.S., Lindegaard, H., Hygiene in a Historical Perspective (2007) Hygiejne i et historisk perspektiv, , Institut for Produktion og Ledelse, DTU; Latour, B., Woolgar, S., (1988) Laboratory Life - The Construction of Scientific Facts, , Princeton University Press; Weick, K.E., (1996) Sensemaking in Organizations, , Sage Publications; Simon, H., (1969) The Sciences of the Artificial, , MIT Press; Cross, N., (2007) Designerly Ways of Knowing, , Springer; Ministry of Science, Technology and Development (2004) Teknologisk fremsyn om hygiejne - Forkningspolitisk handlingsplan; Smith, L.H., Kristensen, J.E., Light, Fresh Air and Cleanliness - Birth of the Modern Social Hygiene (1986) Lys, luft og renlighed - Den moderne social-hygiejnes fødsel, , Akademisk Forlag; Semmelweis, I., Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers , 3, p. 2008. , 1861, republished as: The Etiology, Concept, and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever, Social Medicine; Boyce, J.M., Pittet, D., Guidelines for hand hygiene in health-care setting: recommendations for the healthcare infection control practices and advisory committee and hand hygiene task force (2002) Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 23 (12), pp. S3-S41; Latour, B., (1987) Science in Action - How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society, , Harward University Press; Pinch, T., Oudshorn, N., (2007) How Users Matter, , MIT Press; Bijker, W.E., (2002) Of Bicycles, Bakelites and Bulbs - Toward a Theory of Sociotechnical Change, , MIT Press; (1996) Making Technology Our Own?

Weak signals are signs anticipating or pointing to possibly emerging new issues. Weak signals can be perceived through all five human senses: they can be seen, heard, smelled, felt or even tasted. Visual weak signals are weak signals shown in a visual form. They can be represented as images: photos, paintings, drawings, video clips, etc. [2]. The method used by the Futures Window is to display weak signals in a visual form as a slide show on a large screen with the aim of encouraging people to anticipate and innovate futures. The Futures Window could be a central tool to be used in Creative Foresight Spaces (CFS). 11The idea for the concept of Creative Foresight Space originated during two research projects ""Technology Futures Forum"" and ""SOMED"" (Social media at the crossroads of physical, virtual and digital worlds), initiated by Dr. Sirkka Heinonen, and first described in the conference presentation by Toni Ahlqvist, Minna Halonen and Sirkka Heinonen ""Social Media Applications for Innovative Working Environments"" 9th International Conference of Finland Futures Research Centre and Finland Futures Academy ""Culture and Innovation - The search for Creative Power in Economics and Societies"". Session on Social Media and Technology I. 6-8 June 2007, Turku, Finland.

The concept of CFS is offered as one way of responding to the growing demand for innovation in corporations and work organisations. The FW method was tested at VTT Technical Research Centre (http://www.vtt.fi/) in Finland in two pilots in 2006-2007. A survey was conducted to gather employee's opinions of the FW experiments. The results show that employees considered the FW positively and they confirmed that it stimulated futures thinking. The results of this study are encouraging for further developing the Futures Window as a key element of CFS.

The following theories and associated theoretical frameworks are discussed in the article: (1) Environmental Scanning Model, (2) Nonaka's Knowledge Management Theory, (3) Gammelgaard's and Ritter's Knowledge Retrieval Matrix, (4) Boisot's Information Space Model and (5) Vejlgaard's Diamond Shaped Trend Model. These various and nevertheless complementary perspectives are important for the further development of weak signal analysis, knowledge management theory and knowledge management practices in modern organisations as well as for anticipation and decision-making in policy-making arenas. There are still many theoretical and empirical challenges in these fields of scientific knowledge. A general conclusion is that all these frameworks provide interesting new perspectives for modern futures studies as such. Another conclusion is that there are various knowledge management (KM) and scanning frameworks available for implementing weak signal analysis. However, this paper, its observations and conclusions also imply that a more generalised approach to weak signal analysis needs to be developed and that modern KM theories should be used when developing new futures studies/foresight methodologies. According to the theoretical guidelines presented in this article, it is possible to make the suggestion that it would be wise to integrate the latest developments in weak signal analysis into knowledge management theory and vice versa. © 2011.",,"decision making; knowledge; management; policy making; signal processing; theoretical study",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic Response in Turbulent Environments (1982), Working Paper No. 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, August; Ansoff, I.H., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, p. 510. , Prentice/Hall International; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Webb, J.R., An evaluation of Igor Ansoff's theory of weak signal management by means of an investigation and forecast of future developments in the ophthalmic laser environment (1987), Doctoral thesis, University of Strathclyde; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part I: Introduction (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrintro.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part II: Information Theory (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/infotheory.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part IV: Evolution and Growth of the Weak Signal to Maturity (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrmatur.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Part V: A Process Model for Weak Signal Research (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrprocm.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Presentation in Actes de la 3e Conferénce de l'AIS Amérique (Association for Information Systems); Harris, D.D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals: detecting the next big thing (2002) The Futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-29; Day, G., Schoemaker, P., Scanning the periphery (2005) Harvard Business Review, pp. 135-148. , November; Mendonça, S.S., e Cunha, M.P., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., Wild cards, weak signals and organizational improvisation (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 201-218; Mannermaa, M., Toolbox ja heikot signaalit (1999) Futura, 13 (2), pp. 32-37; Mannermaa, M., A Strong Future from Weak Signals (2004) Heikoista signaaleista vahva tulevaisuus, , WSOY, Porvoo; Hiltunen, E., Heikot signaalit - teoriakatsaus (2000) Futura, 14 (2), pp. 72-77; Hiltunen, E., Heikkojen signaalien käyttö yrityksissä (2001) Futura, 15 (1), pp. 45-50; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Kuusi, O., Hiltunen, E., Linturi, H., Heikot tulevaisuussignaalit - Delfoi tutkimus (2000) Futura, 14 (2), pp. 78-92; Nikander, I.O., Early warnings - a phenomenon in project management (2002), Dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Science in Technology, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Moijanen, M., Heikot signaalit tulevaisuuden tutkimuksessa (2003) Futura, 17 (4), pp. 38-60; Ilmola, L., Kuusi, O., Filters of weak signals hinder foresight: monitoring weak signals efficiently in corporate decision-making (2006) Futures, 38 (8), pp. 908-924; Uskali, T., Paying attention to weak signals - the key concept for innovation journalism (2005) Innovation Journalism, 2 (4), pp. 33-49; Brummer, V., Innovaatioaihioiden verkkopohjainen ideointi ja monikriteerinen seulonta (Internet based generation and multicriteria screening of innovation ideas) (2005), http://www.sal.hut.fi/Publications/pdffiles/TBRU05.pdf, MSc Thesis (Engineering), Department of Physics and Mathematics, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Kuosa, T., Heikko signaali vai merkityksetön kohina: Pattern management - ontologisesti uusi lähestymistapa heikkojen signaalien tarkasteluun ja tulkintaan (2005) Futura, 19 (4), pp. 115-120; e Cunha, M.P., Chia, R., Using teams to avoid peripheral blindness (2007) Long Range Planning, 40 (6), pp. 559-573; Kuosa, T., Futures signals sense-making framework (FSSF): a start-up tool to analyse and categorise weak signals, wild cards, drivers, trends and other types of information (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 42-48; Mendonca, S., Cunha, M.P.E., Ruff, F., Kaivo-oja, J., Venturing into the wilderness: preparing for wild cards in the civil aircraft and asset-management industries.

This finding is consistent with the services of financial analysts becoming more valuable and in greater demand as accruals provide weaker signals about future cash flows. Further, it is accruals quality associated with innate uncertainty in the firm's operating environment that attracts analysts even after controlling for operating uncertainty associated with cash flow and stock return volatility. This suggests that low quality accruals provide an opportunity for analysts to benefit from generating private information. Consistent with analysts providing compensating information, we find that forecasts for firms with lower accruals quality contain more private information. © 2011.","Accruals quality; Analyst coverage; Information asymmetry; Operating uncertainty; Private information",,,,,,"Ahn, H., Cai, J., Hamao, Y., Ho, R.Y.K., Adverse selection, brokerage coverage, and trading activity on the tokyo stock exchange (2005) Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, pp. 1483-1508; Alford, A., Berger, P., A simultaneous equations analysis of forecast accuracy, analyst following, and trading volume (1999) Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance, 14, pp. 219-240. , Summer; Antia, M., Pantzalis, C., Security analyst incentives and quality of analyst generated information (2006) Journal of Investing, 15, pp. 50-55; Barron, O.E., Byard, D., Kile, C., Riedl, E.J., High-technology intangibles and analysts' forecasts (2002) Journal of Accounting Research, 40, pp. 289-312; Barron, O.E., Harris, D.G., Stanford, M., Evidence that investors trade on private event-period information around earnings announcements (2005) The Accounting Review, 80, pp. 403-421; Barron, O.E., Kim, O., Lim, S.C., Stevens, D.E., Using analysts' forecasts to measure properties of analysts' information environment (1998) The Accounting Review, 73, pp. 421-433; Barth, M.E., Kasznik, R., McNichols, M.F., Analyst coverage and intangible assets (2001) Journal of Accounting Research, 39, pp. 1-34; Bhattacharya, N., Desai, H., Venkataraman, K., Earnings quality and information asymmetry: evidence from trading costs.

Secondly, the move to transcend disciplinary specialisation, via inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary approaches is strengthening. Thirdly, at a higher order theoretical level, these developments are explicitly theorized in the discourses associated with postformal reasoning, integral theory and planetary consciousness. In spite of all these developments in other disciplines and knowledge fields, the institution of mass public education, with its underpinning industrial worldview, has been pretty static since its inception two hundred years ago. Finally, the paper identifies three minor, but significant, waves of evolutionary emergence in education over the last hundred years that if articulated and nurtured could strengthen the development of evolutionary pedagogies for the 21st century. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolution of consciousness; Evolutionary pedagogies; Foresight; Futures studies; Integral; Planetary; Postformal; Postformal pedagogies","education; theoretical study",,,,,"Gidley, J., Inayatullah, S., (2002) Youth Futures: Comparative Research and Transformative Visions, , Praeger, Westport, CT; Gidley, J., Bateman, D., Smith, C., (2004) Futures in Education: Principles, Practice and Potential, , Australian Foresight Institute, Melbourne; Freire, P., (1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, , Herder and Herder, New York; Illich, I., (1975) Deschooling Society, , Calder and Boyers, London; Gidley, J., Beyond homogenisation of global education: do alternative pedagogies such as Steiner education have anything to offer an emergent globalis/ing world?

The projects resulted in the evaluation of current methods for obtaining and processing scanning data and new conceptual thinking that may bridge the gap between scanning activities and policy-making. This paper provides an overview of conceptual thinking in two projects, SESTI and FAR Horizon. The key thinking is about emerging issues and aboutimaginative or potential wild cards, both considered to be potential storylines for future development or events that require policy action. Storylines come close to the concept of future narratives, as used in the policy discourse regarding aging in the Netherl and s. The shows that narratives are used by policymakers when they fit a particular strategy, but that the narratives must compete with both present-day (experienced ""past reality"") and future stories in policy discourse. The author describes strong ""future"" narratives and gives special attention those that include imaginative wild cards. The communicative strength of a future narrative (and the included issue) is decisive for its uptake in the discourse (in policy and business communities). However, this strength is only partly connected to its scientific or factual evidence base, since it may contain many elements that are not rational to make it strong. The paper is concerned with what makes a ""strong"" narrative. Next to the authority of the messenger and the interests of the receiver, its psychological and emotional appeal to the audience and its historical context make it persuasive. Examplesare given to show that future narratives are used to influence policy debates and decision making. Some have even succeeded in shaping the future to the interest of the author or for the benefit of society. The argument is that strong imaginative wild cards under the right conditions can have a powerful shaping effect, sometimes as shaping as that of real wild cards on the future.","Early warning; Emerging issues; Horizon scanning; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Chilton, P.A., (2004) Analyzing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice, , London: Routledge; Friedemann, F., Pre-earthquake signals: Underlying physical processes (2011) Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, , (in print); Georghiou, L., Cassingena Harper, J., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Hiltunen, E., Good sources of weak signals: Global study of where futurists look for weak signals (2008) Journal of Futures Studies, 12 (4), pp. 21-42; Loveridge, D., (2009) Foresight: The Art and Science of Anticipating the Future, , New York: Routledge; Markley, O., Staying resilient in a wild-card world (2011) Journal of the Institute of Noetic Science, (6); Morrison, J.L., Environmental scanning (1992) A Primer for New Institutional Researchers, pp. 86-99. , (eds.

The required broad view of the future has also taught the companies not to just collect and analyze as much information as possible but also to give room to intuition and listen very good to external experts. Lastly, the companies more and more use their network to look for 'weak signals' in their business environment thereby attempting to make their companies much more agile so that having a very long view of the future is no longer a dominant approach. Overall, the research shows a contingency perspective towards looking at the future.

Foresight has made a transition from thematic papers and policy briefs to a complex set of methods integrated in the framework of S&T and innovation policy making. Foresight also addresses broad social and economic issues along with conventional S&T problems. It focuses often on interdisciplinary fields and cross-sector problems. It has witnessed the introduction of such new methods as weak signals and wild cards, and it has benefitted from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Russian S&T foresight follows global trends. It has given support for revisions of the national S&T priorities and critical technologies. In 2007-2010, two cycles of the National S&T Foresight (initiated by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation) were completed. They resulted in the creation of frameworks and expert networks for future studies. Foresight culture has been finding deeper roots in Russia. The paper addresses mainly the key features of the third (ongoing) cycle of the national S&T Foresight (2011) against the background of the first two cycles and the international trends. This cycle represents a wider coverage of issues (macroeconomic scenarios, trends in basic research, S&T resources, future dem and for skills, and global drivers of S&T developments); more complicated methodologies (bibliometric analysis, expert panels, surveys, roadmapping, and quantitative models); and a combination of ""market pull"" and ""technology push"" approaches toward estimating future developments. This cycle is building a wider network of experts at new Foresight centres at various Russian research universities. It concludes with a discussion of some barriers still to be overcome in Foresight studies: integration of sectoral visions, deeper analyses of some scientific disciplines, stronger integration into policy making, and spreading among business and research communities.","Critical technologies; Decision-making; Foresight; Long-term forecasting; National innovation system; Roadmapping; Russian long-term S&T foresight; S&T priorities",,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Grand challenges - A new framework for foresight evaluation (2011) Paper Presented at the EU-SPRI Conference, , 20-22 September.

Many organizations fail to supply explanations for key events, or provide explanations that are so vague that they lack real information. As a result, trust can be easily damaged or destroyed through organizational failures and from the inability to repair it. Key Questions and Approach How should organizations repair trust among external stakeholders? In what situations are communications to the public and institutional reforms likely to rebuild public trust following a competence violation or an integrity violation? How can companies rebuild trust when direct observation and interaction with the public cannot readily occur? New Knowledge Institutional reforms can be used to prevent distrust and to signal an organization’s commitment to integrity or competence, and, as such, can effectively rebuild trust. Controllability conditions the choice of trust repair strategies. Controllability assigns “blame” or “fault” to the organization, such as how much to hold another accountable for the failure, even if the organizational actions or inactions are deemed to be the root cause of the failure. Public communication (such as apologies, accounts, and plans) are best conceptualized as a weak signal, but when bundled with more credible signals (such as institutional reforms), communication results in higher levels of public trust than communication or costly actions alone. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,"Anheier, H.K., (1999) When Things Go Wrong: Organizational Failures and Breakdowns, , (ed.)

Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores the grey area that lays between some consolidated analytical concepts, namely: spillovers, corporate responsibility, social cooperation and non-governmental organizations. It is in this grey area that ""social multinationals"" can be placed and examined. Scattered evidence is provided to illustrate the emergence of this relatively new phenomenon. Findings: There are weak signals that the ""social multinational"" is a viable institutional innovation. The economic rationale is mainly represented by what could be defined in Smithian terms as the ""selfless component of self-interest"", combined with the ex ante and ex post advantages associated to multinationality. Institutional and technological transformations have created opportunities for the emergence of this phenomenon over the past three decades. However, there is a need for specifically designed policies to reinforce this relatively new trend in international business. Originality/value: The paper proposes a new analytical category and draws insights on its potential implications for welfare, poverty reduction and economic development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cooperatives; Multinational companies; Non-governmental organizations; Social business; Social responsibility; Spillovers",,,,,,"Aldashev, G., Verdier, T., When NGOs go global: Competition on international markets for development donations (2009) Journal of International Economics, 79 (2), pp. 198-210; Andreoni, J., Payne, A., Do government grants to private charities crowd out giving or fund-raising?

The results are structured in terms of the elements of information system (IS) design theories and the research method applied. At the end, we derive six initial principles for reworked ESS that are more applicable than the state of the art. These principles should improve the ""grasp"" of weak signals and allow better incorporation of environmental scanning findings into the executive decision-making process.

Although a rich body of knowledge exists, concepts are not often used in practice. This article contributes a literature review addressing six findings for ESS design to become more applicable than the state of the art. They are structured by the elements of information systems (IS) design theories. Addressing the lack of a sound requirements analysis, our first finding proposes a 360- degree ESS for executives' ""managing a company"" task and presents how to select just the most important scanning areas to keep focus. Three other findings cover the IS model perspective focusing on a better ""grasp"" of weak signals: define concrete indicators and use IT to identify relevant cause-effective-chains, leverage IT to automate day-to-day routines and monitor the variety of indicators' movements, and leverage expert experience and translate indicators' impact into a balanced opportunity-and-threat portfolio. From the methods perspective on ESS, we fifth propose to incorporate scanning results into executives' decision-making process more closely by generating scenarios from a set of assumptions and the development of indicators. Retrospective controls to update the ESS continuously and collaboration to share the scanning findings in day-to-day operation is our sixth finding. Finally, an instantiation at a large international company helped us validate our findings and to highlight how current developments in IS contribute to successful design, implementation, and day-to-day operation of new-generation ESS.","Balanced chance and risk management; Business intelligence information systems (IS) design; Corporate management","Body of knowledge; Corporate management; Day-to-day operations; Decision making process; Design theory; Economic crisis; Environmental scanning; Expert experience; International company; Literature reviews; Requirements analysis; Scanning area; State of the art; Weak signals; Design; Imaging systems; Industry; Information systems; Risk management; Sustainable development; Scanning",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , 1st Edition.

The least we can say is that it has not been easy. Though this complexity lessens when measuring specific features for local appraisal goals or benchmarking them within a broader framework, measurement of the socio-economic value of ICTs is particularly controversial. Here the challenge is not only to count possessions, connections or usages, but assess to what extent ICT investments trigger new valued added and increase overall performance. This paper aims to highlight various types of measuring contributions, putting them in perspective within a new paradigmatic requirement. More specifically, we claim that ICTs can only be ""measured"" when the measuring objective and context are coupled with: 1. reflexive questioning (how do we know that we know what we know regarding ICT efficiency and effectiveness?), and 2. modelling design and research (how do we represent that efficiency and effectiveness, with what computing modelling techniques and within which kind of assumption and theoretical debates?). After examining traditional views on ICT measurement, this paper suggests some concrete steps forward in measuring-modelling and discusses the most promising ways to tackle grand challenge level issues (ICT impact is not about small improvements only). The paper builds upon the hypothesis that there is a need to develop meta-measuring and multi-modelling approaches which address macro-economic needs as well as micro-economic indications. The paper concludes by outlining how user-driven dynamics and broader transformational signals can lead us to a better understanding and measurement of critical Information Society dynamics such as participation and democracy, computer literacy and wellbeing, governance and inclusion to mention just a few.

The first-minimalism- emphasizes public interventions that incorporate market concepts and practices while also centralizing and minimizing administrative discretion. The second- experimentalism-emphasizes interventions in which the central government affords broad discretion to local administrative units but measures and assesses their performance in ways designed to induce continuous learning and revision of standards. Minimalism has been prominent in legal scholarship and in the policy discourse of recent presidential administrations, but its practical impact has been surprisingly limited. By contrast, experimentalism, which has had a lower profile in academic and public discussion, has visibly influenced a broad range of critical policy initiatives in the United States and abroad. Indeed, key initiatives of the Obama Administration, including the Food Safety Modernization Act and the Race to the Top education program, are virtually unintelligible from any other perspective. We argue that, in practice, minimalism suffers from an excessive preoccupation with static efficiency norms and price signals, and from insufficient attention to learning and ""weak signals"" of risk and opportunity. Experimentalist intervention is a more promising approach in the growing realm of policy challenges characterized by uncertainty about both the definition of the relevant problems and the solutions. © 2011, Charles F.

Especially in the field of quantum cryptography random numbers are essential for an unconditional secure key distribution [1]. Recently generators based on the foundational unpredictability of quantum mechanics have become increasingly popular to produce truly random numbers [2]. Here, we present a generator producing unique and truly random bit sequences based on the measurement of the quantum uncertainty of a continuous variable vacuum state [3]. Vacuum states have the advantage of being inherently pure states, i.e. they cannot be tempered with by an adversary and are easily detectable. Therefore, they are an ideal resource for a quantum RNG. Our RNG consists of a simple homodyne detection system. A weak signal, which in our case is the vacuum state, and a strong laser beam interfere on a symmetric beam splitter and its two output beams impinge on two balanced detectors. The signal of the two detectors are digitized, subtracted and stored. By subtracting the two currents, a quadrature amplitude of a pure vacuum state is measured. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Balanced detector; Continuous variables; Homodyne detection; Output beam; Pure state; Random number generators; Random Numbers; Secure key distribution; Vacuum state; Weak signals; Electron optics; Number theory; Optics; Quantum cryptography; Quantum electronics; Uncertainty analysis; Vacuum; Vacuum applications; Random number generation",,,,,"Gisin, N., Quantum cryptography (2002) Rev.

Focusing on the strength of the signal generated by HRM practices, we develop a framework for contract creation. Specifically, we define and outline how weak signals generate psychological contracts and strong signals develop legally binding contracts. We provide several examples of HRM hiring practices, the weak and strong signals which they emit and the psychological and legal contracts which they create. Our key contribution is to provide a precise model for understanding the distinction between a psychological and legal contract. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Human resource management practices; Legal contracts; Psychological contracts; Signaling theory",,,,,,"Aiman-Smith, L., Bauer, T.N., Cable, D.M., Are you attracted?

Innovative companies are aware of weak signals coming from the periphery and of trends in their industry, and they monitor the coherence between weak signals and trends (the external perspective) and strategic direction (the internal perspective).The literature today does not provide well-framed and complete methodologies for assessing the coherence among trends, vision and products. Therefore, the authors propose a methodology called ""the methodology of future coverage"", which measures how much the strategy oriented to the future effectively covers trends and megatrends. In other words, it helps to check the contents and the coherence of the firm' vision and products and those of the trends that will have relevance for the future of the industry, and this process supplies firms with supplementary information on how to improve. The authors tested this methodology and exemplified its use via the Eurotech case study, employing longitudinal analysis. The methodology can be useful as a tool for diagnosing the coherence between trends and company strategy. Moreover, from a dynamic point of view, it can be used as a tool to check on the company's progress in following up on trends by adapting its strategy over time. Finally, the methodology can be also used as a tool for cross-comparison of the ""level of future orientation"" among companies in the same industry. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend","Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend; Industry; corporate strategy; field method; forecasting method; future prospect; innovation; strategic approach; trend analysis",,,,,"Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1994) Competing for the Future, , Harward Business School Press, Boston; Okun, A., (1981) Prices and Quantities: A Macroeconomic Analysis, , The Brooking Institution; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , The Free Press, New York; Ansoff, H.I., The emerging paradigm of strategic behaviour (1987) Strateg.

This paper discusses this development in the PPI and offers some illustrative examples to demonstrate the vital need for opening up new strategic options. To address these challenges, we launch a dynamic strategic framework for a PPI firm. This dynamic capabilities- and strategic options-based framework comprises of (i) sensing the weak signals of the operational environment, (ii) formulating them as strategic options in order to capture their upside potential, (iii) hedging against the downside risks of the options, (iv) exercising these options in often thin (i.e., imperfect) intangible knowledge assets markets, and (v) reconfiguring the existing knowledge base and capabilities to sustain competitive advantage obtained. The framework will be illustrated with strategic options possible for the PPI the main focus being on the interface between the PPI and energy industry by means of a forest biorefinery case. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic capabilities; Forest biorefinery; Pulp and paper industry; Scale economies; Scope economies; Strategic options","Dynamic capabilities; Forest biorefinery; Pulp and paper industry; Scale economies; Scope economies; Strategic options; Climate change; Competition; Industrial management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Pulp; Refining; Paper and pulp industry; Economic Analysis; Forests; Industrial Engineering; Paper Industry; Pulp Industry; Refiners; Seasonal Variation",,,,,"Ambrosini, V., Bowman, C., What are dynamic capabilities and are they a useful construct in strategic management?

Although a substantial body of knowledge exists, these concepts are not often used by practitioners. Based on a literature research, this article outlines six guidelines for designing environmental scanning systems that are more applicable than the state of the art. We incorporate these guidelines in a six-step method and focus on how the capabilities of ""modern"" information systems (IS) enable a better ""grasp"" of weak signals and a closer incorporation of the findings into the executives' decision-making process. Applying this reworked method at a raw materials and engineering company leads to a first instantiation - the ""Corporate Radar.""

What are the shaping forces, or sources of change and what might be their impacts, particularly where these may create entirely new challenges and opportunities? Futures experts (attendees of the FTA 2008 Conference) were invited to state their opinions on these questions by considering the trends, drivers, wilds cards, discontinuities and weak signals likely to shape the future through the Big Picture Survey. The survey was launched 6 months prior to the Conference. More than 250 responses were submitted by the Conference date. The results collected were synthesised and presented back to the attendees in a plenary presentation by the authors. The current paper aims to clarify the concepts first by suggesting definitions and discussing the distinctions between them. The paper then presents the rationales of conducting the Big Picture Survey (BPS), presents its methodology and discusses the results of the survey in a greater extent. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"survey; twenty first century; Canada; United Kingdom",,,,,"van Rij V.

Odyssea, Station 5, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","In the domain of futures studies, the need to develop methods and concepts to identify risks or opportunities ""early enough"" has become an issue and almost a discrete sub-field with its own debates, specialties and schools of thought.Our examination of the literature in this domain shows that early detection, early warning or weak signal analysis, to mention just a few of the terms being used, tends to convey the idea that finding faint evidence of possible futures is actually rather easy. We, however, believe that it is far from being an off-the-shelf process for whoever wants to detect early signs of changes. At the very least it raises cost/benefit questions, and it may have some shortcomings which, if ignored, could substantially increase the vulnerability of an organization. Our goal in this paper is to explore ways of going beyond an overly optimistic approach and provide a basis for the pragmatic use of weak signals and similar notions in strategic management and policy-making processes.After browsing through the several approaches that propose methods for the ""early"" tackling of trends, uncertainties, risks or opportunities to come, we will focus on the approaches defined by 1) weak signals and 2) early warnings or equivalents for the analysis of possible futures. We will in particular examine how mainstream claims have been presented then improved in the last 25 years, as well as how some of the problems involved have been insufficiently addressed so far. We will then show how these problems (closely linked to how the early perception claims are configured - how they are framed and modeled but also made affordable and useful) can directly impact the performance and management style of the organizations and societal settings in which they are deployed. The concluding section will propose a pragmatic approach to the problems raised: paradigmatic weaknesses or forms of blindness. This precautionary principle should lead to a real option approach in terms of futures to be considered and evaluated, so as to enhance the chances of avoiding risks, as well as following up promising directions, radical innovations or, more generally, strategic decision-making processes in both the corporate and policy-making arenas. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Early detection; Early warning; Strategic intelligence; Strategic planning; Weak signal","Early detection; Early warning; Management style; Optimistic approach; Policy making; Possible futures; Precautionary principle; Radical innovation; Real Options; Strategic decisions; Strategic intelligence; Strategic management; Weak signals; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Innovation; Management science; Strategic planning; Uncertainty analysis; Signal detection; decision making; early warning system; forecasting method; future prospect; precautionary principle; risk assessment",,,,,"Lüken, M., Baisch, F., Decision support based on weak signals: overcoming the implementation gap of strategic early warning systems (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics 1998, Conference theme: Intelligent Systems for humans in a Cyberworld, , IEEE, Piscataway, NJ; Nikander, O., (2002), Early Warnings - A phenomenon in project management, PhD Dissertation, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Miller, K.D., Waller, H.G., Scenarios, real options and integrated risk management (2003) Long Range Plann., 35, pp. 93-107; Ilmola, L., Kotsalo-Mustonen, A., Filters of weak signals hinder foresight: monitoring weak signals efficiently for corporate decision-making (2004) 2nd International Conference on Organizational Foresight, , http://hosting.fountainpark.com/strategysignals/pdf/liite2.pdf, Strathclyde University, Glasgow; Fuller, T., de Smedt, P., From oracles to dialogue (2008) Third International Seminar on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis: Impacts and Implications for Policy and Decision-making, Sevilla, Oct. 16-17; Shannon, C., Weaver Warren, W., (1949) The Mathematical Theory of Computation, , University of Illinois Press, Urbana; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

Very often, it does not at first contact fit in with our conventional understanding, experience or any context we are used to. Hence, we may say that we are overwhelmed with constantly changing raw data, and strategic actors especially tend to be short of more rapid, up-to-date, valid and in-depth understanding of the transforming business landscape and social environment. Strategic intelligence is an emerging field of business consulting, which aims to undertake the task of revealing large, complex or complicated issues of transformation in a more understandable form. Pattern management, however, can be seen as one field or one approach of strategic intelligence. It is an approach that may, on one hand, be based more on empiric data and formal structures than other forms of strategic intelligence, but, on the other hand, it is a very heuristic approach to integrate quantitative data, reasoning and narratives. The main attempts of this article are, first, to show, what are in general the most commonly used ways of managing, finding, drawing, reasoning or anticipating patterns from our environment, and second, to locate how the concept of pattern can be understood in different ways. From the gathered knowledge, this article presents three main categories of reasoning patterns: empirical calculation (EC) is common especially in enterprise consulting. Theory proving with observations (TPO) is common especially in natural sciences, and real combining (RC) is common especially in qualitative research and in narrative. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Complexity; Data mining; Emergence; Pattern management; Reasoning; Sense making; Strategic intelligence; Weak signals","Complexity; Emergence; Pattern management; Reasoning; Sense making; Strategic intelligence; Weak signals; Data mining; Heuristic methods; Metadata; corporate strategy; data mining; empirical analysis; heuristics; information; management; theoretical study",,,,,"Russell, R.L., (2007) Sharpening Strategic Intelligence: Why the CIA Gets It Wrong and What Needs to Be Done to Get It Right, , Cambridge University Press; (2007) Managing Strategic Intelligence Techniques and Technologies, , Information Science Publishing, M.

The goal is the acquisition of soft-skills (e.g. negotiation, leadership, and identification of weak signals) and complex competences which are needed in emerging fields such as Sustainable Global Manufacturing. Sustainability combines environmental, economic, and social dimensions and is considered to be a complex and hard to learn subject needing a lot of experience to create competence. Therefore, the construction of a serious game to support the generation of such competences is not trivial and must be founded on a sound requirements analysis. The aim of this paper is to present relevant findings from the requirements analysis phase for developing a serious game scenario for a technology-enhanced learning platform called TARGET. The target audience is composed of master grade students of business administration and young professionals employed in medium level management positions. The methodology for requirements elicitation is based on the Volere template combined with subject matter experts' interviews. © 2011 Research Institute for Ope.","Competences; Requirements Analysis; Serious Gaming; Sustainable Global Manufacturing; Volere Template","Manufacture; Personnel training; Requirements engineering; Sustainable development; Competences; Requirements analysis; Serious gaming; Sustainable global manufacturing; Volere Template; Serious games",,,,,"Arena, M., Ciceri, N.D., Terzi, S., Bengo, I., Azzone, G., Garetti, M., A state-of-the-art in industrial sustainability: Definitions, tools and metrics (2009) International Journal of Product Life Cycle Management, 1, pp. 207-251; Baalsrud Hauge, J., Duin, H., Hunecker, F., (2008) Application Areas for Serious Games in Virtual Organisations in Manufacturing, pp. 77-84. , J.

Although a rich body of know-ledge exists, concepts are not often used in practice. This article contributes a literature review addressing six findings for ESS design to become more applicable than the state of the art. They are structured by the elements of information systems (IS) design theories. Addressing the lack of a sound requirements analysis, our first finding proposes 360-degree ESS for executives’ “managing a company” task and presents how to select just the most important scanning areas to keep focus. Three other findings cover the IS model perspective focusing on a better “grasp” of weak signals: define concrete indicators and use IT to identify relevant cause-effective-chains, leverage IT to automate dayto- day routines and monitor the variety of indicators’ movements, and—as a fourth finding—leverage expert experience with an impact matrix and translate indicators’ impact into a balanced opportunity-and-threat portfolio. From the methods perspective on ESS, we propose to more closely incorporate scanning results into executives' decision-making process by generating scenarios from a set of environment assumptions as well as to use retrospective controls to continuously update the ESS and collaborate to share the scanning findings day-to-day. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2011.","Balanced chance and risk management; Corporate management; Information and communication technology (ICT); Literature review","Decision making; Imaging systems; Information systems; Risk management; Scanning; Balanced chance and risk managements; Corporate management; Decision making process; Environmental scanning; Information and Communication Technologies; Literature reviews; Managing a companies; Requirements analysis; Sustainable development",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York; Albright, K.S., Environmental scanning: Radar for success (2004) The Information Management Journal, 38 (3), pp. 38-45; Ansoff, H.I., Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-32; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic Issue Management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1 (2), pp. 131-148; Arnott, D., Pervan, G., Eight key issues for the decision support systems discipline (2008) Decision Support Systems, 44 (3), pp. 657-672; Choo, C.W., Information Use and Early Warning Effectiveness: Perspectives and Prospects (2009) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60 (5), pp. 1071-1082; Choudhury, V., Sampler, J.L., Information Specificity and Environmental Scan-ning: An Economic Perspective (1997) MIS Quarterly, 21 (1), pp. 25-53; Ciborra, C., Notes in Improvisation and Time in Organizations.

Transformational changes might only occur, in many instances, over time frames that extend well beyond those of mainstream approaches to planning. The need for more explicit attention to longer term futures is reflected in the increasing use of scenario-based processes applied to sustainability challenges. The full potential of scenario development remains, however, largely untapped; many audiences have yet to be engaged, intrigued and influenced by them. This review article explores key barriers to more effective use of scenario development in relation to sustainability challenges, including: (1) the persistent predictive orientation of sustainability planning exercises; (2) the relatively low level of interest in weak signals and their implications; (3) institutionalized aversion to long term planning; and (4) the predominance of an essentialist perspective. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Essentialism; Scenario building in support of sustainability strategy (SBSS); Scenario development; Scenarios; Weak signals",,,,,,"Carlsson-Kanyama, A., Dreborg, K.H., Moll, H.C., Padovan, D., Participative backcasting: A tool for involving stakeholders in local sustainability planning (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 34-46; Peterson, G.D., Cumming, G.S., Carpenter, S.R., Scenario planning: A tool for conservation in an uncertain world (2002) Conserv.

The system would take content that is personal but not proprietary, and create new value from it by detecting larger, long-term patterns that individual users might not be aware of. It would create the means to better distribute credit for finding weak signals or emerging trends, and create new forms of professional credit for work that currently remains invisible. It would create goods that are useful to individual practitioners and the profession as a whole. Finally, it would serve as a foundation for collaborative research in a community of practice that is highly distributed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"detection method; future prospect; Internet; research work; software; trend analysis",,,,,"Botterhuis, L., van der Duin, P., de Ruijter, P., van Wijck, P., Monitoring the future: building an early warning system for the Dutch Ministry of Justice (2009) Futures, 41. , See for example, J.

Weak signals are identified from the early 20th century indicating the emergence of new knowledge patterns. These signals have strengthened in the last 40 years. The paper first identifies new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, religion and education. New knowledge patterns are then identified in discourses that traverse disciplinary boundaries through transdisciplinary approaches such as futures studies and planetary/global studies. The paper then discusses evolution of consciousness, identifying research that theorises new ways of thinking as being related to individual psychological development and/or socio-cultural evolution. Finally, evolutionary concepts are discussed that attempt to meta-cohere the new knowledge patterns via the terms postformal, integral and planetary. Notably, academic research on "" futures of thinking,"" "" evolution of consciousness"" and/or "" global mindset change"" has been, until now, largely ignored by mainstream academic discourse on evolution, consciousness and futures studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Adult developmental psychology; Evolution of consciousness; Futures; Integral; Macrohistory; Planetary; Postformal; Transdisciplinarity","academic research; evolution; future prospect; interdisciplinary approach; philosophy; psychology",,,,,"Miller, R., Making connections to the world: some thoughts on holistic curriculum [Electronic version] (2006) Encounter: Education for Meaning and Social Justice, 19 (3); Naisbitt, J., (2006) Mindset: Eleven Ways to Change the Way You See - and Create - The Future, , Collins Business, Harper Collins, New York, NY; László, E., (2006) The Chaos Point: The World at the Crossroads, , Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc., Charlottsville, VA; Gidley, J., An other view of integral futures: de/reconstructing the IF brand (2010) Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning and Futures Studies, 42 (2), pp. 125-133; Hampson, G., Integral futures and futures of integral: an analysis of Richard Slaughter's analysis of Causal Layered Analysis (2010) Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning and Futures Studies, 42 (2), pp. 134-148; Slaughter, R., Introduction: Integral futures methodologies (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 101-108; Hayward, P., Pathways to integral perspectives (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 109-119; Gidley, J., The evolution of consciousness as a planetary imperative: an integration of integral views (2007) Integral Review: A Transdisciplinary and Transcultural Journal for New Thought, Research and Praxis, 5, pp. 4-226; Commons, M.L., Richards, F.A., Organizing components into combination: how stage transition works (2002) Journal of Adult Development, 9 (3), pp. 159-177; Einstein, A., Relativity: The Special and General Theory (Translated Robert W.

This paper aims at using a debate that took place in a specific foresight discussion arena on early detection and weak signal analysis, as a constructive epistemic detour to eventually contribute to such a reinforcement of Rosen's anticipatory system proposal. Design/methodology/approach: The author aims at revisiting Rosen's framework with stimulating inputs drawing upon the early detection debates, by first assessing the original concepts brought up by Ansoff in the 1970s and 1980s and its further enhancements by contemporary scholars. A rather constructivist approach is then developed to weak signal analysis, aiming at emphasising the need, in analytical situations involving social system features, for reflexive stages and capacities. Bearing this requirement in mind, the productive value of the framing and meta-framing notions is explored, in order to apply them to Rosen's anticipatory systems and possibly contribute to enriching his original concept. Findings: How effective the framing and meta-framing couple can be for a series of anticipatory issues is described in a detailed manner and, then more specifically, Rosen's anticipatory system concept is revisited in the light of those inputs, aiming at putting into perspective new options for research and anticipation activities in general. Research limitations/implications: The paper is essentially conceptual and based on a rich but disputable detour by early detection and weak analysis issues so as to emphasise key reflexive references and method. However, most of this material is taken from domains rather untypical of Rosennean debates and in addition would need to be completed by a series of supportive cases, but that is beyond the scope and scale of this paper. Practical implications: The paper sets clear distinctions and boundaries for when and when not to apply reflexive steps in a foresight exercise, including in the context of rolling out a Rosen type of approach. Research decision making both in the corporate and policy-making contexts can benefit from such clues and supportive framework conditions. Social implications: Social systems are typically complex and involve multiple perspectives and viewpoints; they concern a series of major challenges to be coped with locally or more globally, at environmental, political, cultural or technological level, and in that category of anticipatory endeavor, the framing/meta-framing epistemic couple may be of great usefulness. Originality/value: Although rather conceptual, the detour proposed by the paper aims at creating a reflexive distance and enriched capability to evaluate one's potential biases and blind spots in anticipatory modelling activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Communication technologies; Complexity theory; Environmental management; Governance; Innovation",,,,,,"Adam, B., Has the future already happened?

Based on this segmentation, in a merchandising situation, one can interact with the customer to identify the segment to which the customer belongs and in turn offer the proper product and merchandising. Design/methodology/approach: The study deals with the creation of new hair products, using both ideation by brand Delphi™ and by experimental design of ideas with conjoint measurement (IdeaMap.Net). It ends with the creation of a merchandising product for hair coloring based on concept segmentation. First the internet was used to facilitate the acquisition and prioritization of new ideas. Then the experimental design of ideas was used to identify which perform well in the body of test concepts. Findings: Three segments were identified: Segment 1 (54 percent) wants easy to use, high technology, and reliable products. Segment 2 (25 percent) wants to give, and get information about themselves, with respect to hair coloring. Furthermore, they want to make information giving/getting a process, not simply a rapid 1-2-3 affair. Segment 3 (21 percent) wants results. They want information, primarily what the product will do for them, what it delivers. Research limitations/implications: The innovative research deals with the creation of ""new to the world"" product ideas and the segmentation of respondents into different groups, based on their mind-sets. Practical implications: The segmentation results provide the manufacturer and the trade with an opportunity to fine-tune the development of the new product and its merchandising. One of the recurring questions, however, is how to find these segments in the population? Data mining works by searching for assignment rules that put people into the segments based on a decision rule. The variables used by the decision rule come from external information about the respondent, which the respondent may have provided previously, or patterns of purchases that the individual may have made over time. The objective is to increase the chances of correctly classifying a new individual as a member of one of the three segments, and by so doing present the prospect with a better offer, whether an improved product or shopping experience.

Although trends are considered to be important drivers of environmental discontinuities which may lead to strategic surprises, there is no operationalization from a strategic point of view. In this paper we are going to conceptualize trends as (socio-cultural) innovations. This leads to important implications. If the nature of innovation is taken seriously, then strategic trend diagnosis has to deal with two different aspects, invention and diffusion. First, we are going to present a framework for identifying the invention aspect of a trend (i.e., "" the new"" ) which is based on the fact that "" the new"" results from a transgression of contextual boundaries. Second, we are going to operationalize the diffusion of "" the new"" as a threefold process of normalization - i.e., an unusual practice becomes social convention. Taken together, these two aspects provide a theoretical link between trends and market creation. In addition, by relating the above operationalizations to an entrepreneurial strategy-making framework, strategic issue diagnosis can be improved and more seamlessly linked to strategy formulation. © 2009.",,"conceptual framework; entrepreneur; future prospect; innovation; market development; organizational framework; planning theory; strategic approach; technology diffusion; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , The Macmillian Company, New York; Keegan, W.J., (1967), Scanning the International Business Environment, Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, Boston; Bright, J.R., Evaluating signals of technological change (1970) Harvard Business Review, 48, pp. 62-70; Bright, J.R., Forecasting by monitoring signals of technological change (1973) A Guide to Practical Technological Forecasting, pp. 238-256. , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, J.R.

Yet due to their inherent flexibility, open-market repurchase programs have long been criticized as weak signals lacking commitment. We evaluate whether some managers potentially use buyback announcements to mislead investors. We focus on cases where managers were seemingly under heavy pressure to boost stock prices and might have announced a repurchase only to convey a false signal. For suspect cases, the immediate market reaction to a buyback announcement does not differ from that generally observed. However over longer horizons, suspect firms do not enjoy the improvement in economic performance otherwise observed. Suspect firms repurchase less stock. Further, managers in suspect firms have comparatively higher exposure to stock options, a potentially endogenous result suggesting greater sensitivity to both stock valuation and to future equity dilution. Overall, the results suggest only a limited number of managers may have used buybacks in a misleading way as ""cheap talk."" Yet as theory also suggests, we find no long-run economic benefit to this behavior. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze why firms with average quality debt have not changed their tactics and consent to publishing their grade which would then differentiate an average quality debt from a riskier one. Design/methodology/approach: The paper estimates the mean values of ranks and the diagonal of the migration matrix on the basis of data on 1,639 bond rankings listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and publications by the largest Israeli rating agency, Maalot. Findings: From 1992 to 2004, one-third of the Israeli firms that had initially requested ranking from a rating agency decided to prevent publication. The findings show the average bond rankings published by Israeli rating agencies tend to be relatively high, while bond rating migration is relatively slow. There was no change in the shape of the statistical distribution of ratings between 2004 and 2007. The strategy of borrowers has remained stable and shows no change over 16 years of credit ratings in Israel. Practical implications: Debtors with an average quality debt view the publications of the credit agency as a weak signal and do not expect the investment community to give them better credit for an average grade. To obtain more detailed ratings, regulators along with the credit rating agencies should consider enforcement of the publication of the rank of firms that requested evaluation. Originality/value: The paper offers insights into why credit ratings in Israel have remained stable over the last decade and explains why Israeli firms with average quality debt do not change their strategy and do not request credit rating agencies to issue their grade publically which could then distinguish them from firms with worse quality debt. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bonds; Credit rating; Israel",,,,,,"Acharya, S., A generalized econometric model and tests of a signalling hypothesis with two discrete signals (1988) Journal of Finance, 43 (2), pp. 413-429; Altman, E.I., The importance and subtlety of credit rating migration (1998) Journal of Banking & Finance, 22, pp. 1231-1247; Altman, E.I., Kao, D.L., The implications of corporate bond ratings drift (1992) Financial Analysts Journal, 48 (3), pp. 64-75; www.mof.gov.il/bachar/pdf/bacharFullReport.pdf, Bachar Committee (2004), (accessed October 10, 2006); Bangia, A., Diebold, F.X., Kronimus, A., Schagen, C., Schuermann, T., Ratings migration and the business cycle, with application to credit portfolio stress testing (2002) Journal of Banking & Finance, 26 (2), pp. 445-474; (2009) Main Israeli Economic Data, , www.bankisrael.gov.il/deptdata/mehkar/indic/indice.htm, Bank of Israel, available at: (accessed June 5, 2009); Beaver, W.H., Shakespeare, C., Soliman, M.T., Differential properties in the ratings of certified versus non-certified bond-rating agencies (2006) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 42 (3), pp. 303-334; Byoun, S., Shin, Y., Unsolicited credit rating theory and empirical analysis (2002) Proceedings of the Midwest Business Economics, pp. 98-112; Faulkender, M., Petersen, M.A., Does the source of capital affect capital structure?

The philosophy of FSSF is based on the principles of environmental scanning and pattern management, which state that if there is a grand transformation process on the way or if there is a new emerging pattern or phenomenon, such a process will certainly be reflected in many different ways. Therefore, in this philosophy, futures knowledge is believed to be fragmented between various simultaneous and overlapping sources. Here, a researcher's task is to carry out a sufficient environmental scanning process and to cluster and sense how to create the emerging future through a pattern management process where FSSF plays a role as the first start-up tool. Alternatively, FSSF can also be used as a general knowledge management and sense-making tool for any kind of analyses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing from actor-network theory, non-human entities may ""translate"" new, unexpected stakeholders to support their aims.

Findings: The examples provided show that corporate crises result partly from previously unacknowledged non-human spheres of influence and cause corporations serious losses. Corporations that take a proactive stance and monitor the weak signals of change are able to improve their standing and maintain legitimacy. Research limitations/implications: The framework created requires more testing with different examples across contexts and cultures. Future studies should examine the process of translation more deeply and examine who can potentially be translated into a stakeholder. Practical implications: Corporate communication should play ""the devil's advocate"" on issues and analyze not only stakeholders, but also non-human entities that may be able to translate others into joining their cause.

In addition, Wi-Fi is not only growing in terms of numbers, but is also becoming pervasive in many respects. We are not concerned so much with the remarkable features and development patterns of Wi-Fi, however, as with the open-ended questions that Wi-Fi still raises and the uncertainties and complexities it carries with it. In this chapter, we envisage the possible futures of Wi-Fi. In the second section, we acknowledge the historical build-up and successful characteristics of Wi-Fi. In this evolution we include quantitative and qualitative evidence, as well as a few material narratives that are strongly supportive of current Wi-Fi developments. In this context, we consider what to make of the various forecasts, and how to establish the kind of knowledge perspective that users and decision makers can work with, and therefore what kind of methodological pathways may help us reach our goal. In the third section, we discuss the question of whether the future of Wi-Fi can somehow be ‘guessed’ from existing innovation models, or how to use such models in an open and helpful manner. In the fourth section, we explore the Wi-Fi journey that still lies ahead of us, in terms of options, contexts and conditions, in particular through a micro-Delphi study – i.e. a specific enquiry among experts. We present the rough output of this exploratory study in the form of potential scenarios. In the fifth and concluding section, we examine what might be some weak signals of change or, on the contrary, might be reinforcements of trends that provide early indications as to the Wi-Fi to come in the next ten years or so. We argue that one of the aspects that will be a deciding factor between the various options is the dynamic tension between innovation and regulation. © Wolter Lemstra, Vic Hayes and John Groenewegen 2011.",,,,,,,"Bass, F.M., The adoption of a marketing model: Comments and observations (1986) Innovation Diffusion Models of New Product Acceptance, pp. 203-232. , V.

Despite the increasing safety level, industrial sites are asking for innovative tools. The notion of weak signals will enable the industries to anticipate danger and improve their safety management. Our preliminary results show the huge interest and relevance of the weak signals but also the difficulty to, concretely, treat them within the Safety Management. We found out that organizational features are ""weak signals blockers"": Bureaucratic management of Safety, linear and bottom-up communication, and a reactive Safety Management.

This paper discusses this development in the forest industry and offers some illustrative examples to demonstrate the vital need for opening up new strategic options. To address these challenges, we launch a dynamic strategic framework for a forest firm. This dynamic capabilities- and strategic options- based framework comprises of (i) sensing the weak signals of the operational environment, (ii) formulating them as strategic options in order to capture their upside potential, (iii) hedging against the downside risks of the options, (iv) exercising these options often related to imperfect intangible knowledge assets markets, and (v) reconfiguring the existing knowledge base and capabilities to sustain competitive advantage obtained. The framework is illustrated with strategic options possible for the forest industry the main focus being on the interface between the forest and energy industries by means of a forest biorefinery case.",,"Biorefineries; Business opportunities; Competitive advantage; Downside risks; Dynamic capabilities; Energy industry; Forest industry; Global climate changes; Illustrative examples; Knowledge assets; Knowledge base; Operational environments; Strategic frameworks; Strategic options; Weak signals; Competition; Innovation; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Climate change",,,,,"Autio, E., Dietrichs, E., Führer, K., Smith, K., Innovation Activities in Pulp, Paper and Paper Products in Europe, , Rep. 04/1997 to European Commission, Oslo, Norway: Norwegian Institute for Studies in Innovation, Research and Education (NIFU), Studies in technology, innovation and economic policy (STEP group); Christensen, L.R., Caves, R.E., Cheap talk and investment rivalry in the pulp and paper industry (1997) The Journal of Industrial Economics, 45 (1), pp. 47-60; Perks, H., Jeffery, R., Global network configuration for innovation: A study of international fibre innovation (2006) R and D Management, 36 (1), pp. 67-83. , DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9310.2005.00416.x; Pesendorf, M., Horizontal mergers in the paper industry (2003) RAND Journal of Economics, 34 (3), pp. 495-515; Stanturf, J.A., Kellison, R.C., Broerman, F.S., Jones, S.B., Innovation and Forest Industry: Domesticating the Pine Forests of the Southern United States, 1920-1999 (2003) Forest Policy and Economics, 5 (4), pp. 407-419; Toivanen, H., (2004) Learning and Corporate Strategy: The Dynamic Evolution of the North American Pulp and Paper Industry, 1860-1960, , Doctoral dissertation Georgia Institute of Technology, School of History, Technology and Society; Toland, J., Hard times in Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm (2007) Pulp and Paper International, 49 (12), p. 5; Sorenson, D., Reed, J., Patterson, D., Investors Focus on Opportunities in Cellulosic Ethanol Production (2007) Pulp & Paper, 81 (5), pp. 36-38; Dorian, J.P., Franssen, H.T., Simbeck, D.R., Global challenges in energy (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (15), pp. 1984-1991; McCormick, K., Kaberger, T., Key barriers for bioenergy in Europe: Economic conditions, know-how and institutional capacity, and supply chain co-ordination (2007) Biomass and Bioenergy, 31 (7), pp. 443-452. , DOI 10.1016/j.biombioe.2007.01.008, PII S0961953407000311; Soliño, M., Prada, A., Vázquez, M.X., Green electricity externalities: Forest biomass in an Atlantic European Region (2009) Biomass and Bioenergy, 33 (3), pp. 407-414; Ericsson, K., Huttunen, S., Nilsson, L.J., Svenningsson, P., Bioenergy policy and market development in Finland and Sweden (2004) Energy Policy, 32 (15), pp. 1707-1721. , DOI 10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00161-7, PII S0301421503001617; Van Heiningen, A., (2007) A Concept and Analysis for Converting a Kraft Mill into a Forest Biorefinery, , Presentation Finnish Paper Research Community Serving Europe, Helsinki, Finland; Rodden, G., Actions catching up to words (2008) Pulp & Paper International, 50 (6), pp. 33-37; Thorp, B., Biorefinery offers industry leaders business model for major change (2005) Pulp and Paper, 79 (11), pp. 35-39; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage - Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , New York: The Free Press; Barney, J., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Peteraf, M.A., The cornerstones of competitive advantage: A resource-based view (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (3), pp. 179-191; Teece, D.J., Pisano, G., Shuen, A., Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management (1997) Strategic Management Journal, 18 (7), pp. 509-533; Eisenhardt, K.M., Martin, J.A., Dynamic capabilities: What are they?

Traditionally, it has been discussed in respect to telecommunications, information technologies and electronics. Subjects of this convergence often change what and where customers buy, with Apple's renowned iPhone being one current example for customers' tendency towards products with multiple benefits. More recently also the chemical and its related industries find themselves affected by a larger convergence process. Concentrating on developments at the outposts of the chemical industry, we discuss indications of convergence with an example from the area of Nutraceuticals and Cosmeceuticals. Furthermore, we present and discuss a multiple indicator concept for monitoring convergence in an R&D-intensive field on the basis of publicly available data. We analyze 7, 455 scientific and patent references on phytosterols with the aid of SciFinder Scholar and 3, 836 documents employing STN AnaVist. Our results show clear indications for convergence and a proof of principle for our monitoring concept. A closer look at convergence and effective tools for spotting weak signals appears to be necessary. Particularly for practitioners, the opportunity to get a head start on their current and future competitors is of high strategic importance. © 2009 PICMET.",,"Convergence process; Cosmeceuticals; Effective tool; Nutraceuticals; Proof of principles; Scientific discipline; Weak signals; Chemical industry; Competition; Customer satisfaction; Technology",,,,,"Agrawal, A., Henderson, R., Putting patents in context: Exploring knowledge transfer from MIT (2002) Management Science, 48, pp. 44-60. , Jan; Bainbridge, W.S., Transformative Concepts in Scientific Convergence (2006) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1093, pp. 24-45; Bierly, P., Chakrabarti, A.K., Managing through industry fusion (1999) The dynamics of innovation: Strategic and managerial implications, pp. 7-26. , K.

This attempt takes place within the effort that futures studies have deployed to cope with the need to be 'early' in change processes, and is intended to improve firms' preparedness regarding uncertainties, threats and opportunities. The weak signal notion is one of the metaphors coined to accomplish that, thanks to the seminal role played by Igor Ansoff in the 1970s and 1980s, and the inputs of more recent continuators who have shaped a wide methodological environment. After over 20 years of weak signal exploration, some pending issues suggest the need to re-open some basic hypotheses as well as the use of a wide-angle lens to review the Ansoff legacy and its relevance for management and decision-making. The concepts of framing and meta-framing are the means that will allow us to do this by adding a more reflexive dimension to weak signal analysis, taking account of analysts' and commissioning organisations' own biases, and enhancing firms' robustness against possibly disruptive futures. Pragmatic managerial orientations of how to make use of methodological blends involving reflexive steps will be outlined, also suggesting diverse tracks for further research on weak signal theories and their contributions to both futures studies and strategic management.","Constructivism; Framing; Paradigmatic biases; Reflexivity; Weak signal","decision making; future prospect; hypothesis testing; management practice; signal; strategic approach; theoretical study; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Adam, B., Has the future already happened?

The aim of this article is to discuss the usefulness of developing foresight in a business wargame. Wargaming, a role-playing simulation of a dynamic situation, has been used mainly by the military, but more recently, it has also been used in the context of competitive intelligence and strategy-testing in organisations. A business wargame typically evolves several years into the future, allowing the participants to 'experience' future dynamics in the organisational environment and, consequently, to develop foresight. This article argues that, because of its participative and dynamic nature, business wargaming can overcome cognitive barriers, challenge mental models, detect weak signals of change in an organisational environment, re-direct attention in an organisation, and assist an organisation in developing foresight.","Business wargaming; Foresight; Scenario planning; Weak signals","business; computer simulation; future prospect; organizational framework; signal",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York; Andlinger, G.R., Looking around: What can business games do?

One problem is the fact that indicator based systems fail to deliver a holistic picture about the future. A second problem is the inflexibility in terms of time horizons of leading indicators. Scenarios are well suited to integrate information into holistic pictures on weak signals. While literature about methods of developing scenarios is relatively vast, only few approaches allow the systematic and continuous verification and observation of changes or developments. This paper describes a systematic approach for a scenario-based early detection system. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.","Early detection system; Indicators; Scenario planning; Strategic planning; Weak signals","Planning; Strategic planning; Complex environments; Continuous; Early detection system; Early detections; Indicators; Leading indicators; Scenario planning; Systematic approaches; Time horizons; Weak signals; Signal detection",,,,,"Ansoff, H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Armstrong, J., (1985) Long-Range Forecasting - From Crystal Ball to Computer, , 2nd ed, Wiley-Interscience, New York; Backhaus, K., Erichson, B., Plinke, W., Weiber, R., (2000) Multivariate Analysemethoden: Eine anwendungsorientierte Einführung, , 9th ed, Springer, Berlin; Borjeson, L., Hojer, M., Dreborg, K.H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario types and techniques: Towards a user's guide' (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 723-739; Bürgel, H.D., Reger, G., Ackel-Zackour, R., Technologie-früherkennung in multinationalen unternehmen: Ergebnisse einer empirischen untersuchung (2002) Technologie-Roadmapping, Zukunftsstrategien für Technologieunternehmen, pp. 19-45. , Möhrle, M.G. and Isenmann, R, Eds, Springerm Berlin, pp; (2003) Environmental Indicators Typology and Use in Reporting.

Probe diameter ranged from 5-μm to 100-μm. The 100-μm probe exhibits a 250-7mu;m improvement in spatial resolution compared to a conventional loop probe, measured at a height of 250 μm over differential traces with a 118-μm spacing. Electric field rejection was improved using shielding and using a 180-degree hybrid junction to separate common-mode (electric field) and differential-mode (primarily magnetic field) coupling. A network analyzer with narrow band filtering was used to detect the relatively weak signal from the probe and to allow detection of phase information. An application of the probe is demonstrated where the probe is used to identify the magnitude and phase of magnetic fields produced by currents in very closely-spaced IC package pins. © 2007 IEEE.","Electromagnetic compatibility; Electromagnetic interference; Probe antennas; Scanning antennas; Thin-film devices","Electromagnetic interference; High resolutions; Hybrid junctions; Ic packages; Narrow bands; Network analyzers; Paper documents; Phase informations; Probe antennas; Spatial resolutions; Weak signals; Antennas; Applications; Electric field effects; Electric fields; Electric inverters; Electric network analysis; Electromagnetic compatibility; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic shielding; Electromagnetic wave interference; Electromagnetism; Magnetic fields; Plastic molds; Radiation protection; Scanning; Scanning antennas; Signal interference; Thin film devices; Magnetic materials",,,,,"Weng, H., Beetner, D.G., DuBroff, R.E., Shi, J., Estimation of High-Frequency Currents from Near-Field Scan Measurements IEEE Transactions on EMC, , to appear; Integrated circuits - Measurement of electromagnetic emissions, 150 kHz to 1 GHz - Part 3: Surface Scan Method (2004), IEC 61967-3; Shi, J., Cracraft, M.A., Slattery, K.P., Yamaguchi, M., DuBroff, R.E., Calibration and Compensation of Near-Field Scan Measurements (2005) IEEE Trans.

Yet, this narrow concentration of focus risks overlooking issues, events and transformations occurring at the periphery of corporate awareness that may threaten the survival of the organisation or provide opportunities for expansion. Being able to take in peripheral vision may therefore be crucial to an organisation's wellbeing. In this paper, we discuss how teams may play a crucial role in improving peripheral vision and awareness through their function and orientation. We identify a number of different functions of teams and develop a typology that shows how different types of teams orientate themselves in dealing with focal and peripheral issues. In particular we examine the cases of teams that are most orientated toward the periphery: minimally-structured and immersion teams, and show how each employs specific practices - namely zooming, improvisation, bricolage, scenario thinking, wild cards and weak signals - to sharpen peripheral vision and awareness. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Expo/ Calle Inca Garcilaso s/n, E-41092 Sevilla, Spain","Online Social Networks (OSNs) have gained unprecedented popularity in recent years. OSNs facilitate the interaction among members by providing a dynamic/multimodal platform which enables discussions, sharing of multimedia content, organisation of events, etc. These networks comprise millions of members from all continents and from all age groups - although the younger generation is more prominent. OSN dynamics and inherent patterns of operation are being investigated by academia as a means of studying, for instance, ICT-enhanced social change. Industry uses them to detect new commercial trends and establish marketing strategies. We believe that the huge size of OSNs, the broad and versatile thematic topics and the fact that most users are youngsters made these new modalities of large-scale interaction also worth investigating in regard to the study of the future or foresight. In this paper, we discuss the relevance of OSNs for three objectives of foresight methods, namely creativity, expertise and collective intelligence. First, we argue that OSNs can be regarded as a tool to enhance creativity through the unprecedented modalities of communication and interaction they offer. Second, we propose OSNs as an expert tool to detect emerging changes in social behaviour. We assume that the recorded exchanges of information and thoughts between participants in forums offers an under-exploited source of information for detecting new social trends. The value of this information may be amplified by evaluating it in conjunction with other OSN data, such as member profiles, behavioural patterns or list of contacts or friends. In this way, emerging social trends could be detected. Similar approaches are already used in market research and could be transferred to foresight. Third, we consider OSNs to be a means of aligning individual thinking and fostering collective or ""collaborative"" intelligence for a whole range of possible goals in the future. For each of these three objectives, the theoretical foundations are complemented with some case studies. Given the novelty of the OSN phenomenon and its unexplored potential in many fields, the authors aim to trigger thinking and discussion on the potential application of this emerging phenomenon within foresight, rather than to offer a vademecum on the use of OSNs for foresight activities. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we draw upon complementary evolutionary perspectives and discuss these objectives from the viewpoint of diversity which may be vital in contexts characterized by technological discontinuities and high uncertainties. We also argue that although the scanning of weak signals has been widely advocated in such contexts, the solicitation of ideas for prospective innovations may provide more focused, action-oriented, and comparable reflections of future developments. For the analysis of such ideas, we develop a collaborative foresight method RPM Screening which consists of phases for the generation, revision, multi-criteria evaluation, and portfolio analysis of innovation ideas. We also report experiences from a pilot project where this method was employed to enhance the work of the Foresight Forum of the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Finland. Encouraging results from this project and other recent applications suggest that RPM Screening can be helpful in foresight processes and the development of shared research agendas. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Most often the wild card is defined as a surprising event that has significant consequences. In the literature the examples labelled as wild cards do not always meet this definition. I have divided changes into two categories according to the rapidity of the change taking place: wild cards and gradual changes. By looking at the examples of wild cards in the literature, I found that a large number of them are actually gradual changes. This paper also clarifies the difference between wild cards and weak signals, which are sometimes considered synonymous. Weak signals are a means of avoiding blindness to gradual changes and wild cards in advance.","Early warning signals; Emerging issues; Future; Gradual change; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Åber, L., (1989) Viestintä-tuloksen Tekijä, , Helsinki: Inforviestintä Oy; Ansoff, I., Managing Strategie Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33. , Winter; Ansoff, I., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice/Hall International Inc; Barber, M., Wildcards-Signals from a Future Near You (2006) Journal of Future Studies, 11 (1). , August; Coffman, B., (1997) Weak Signal® Research, Part I: Introduction, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/ winter97/wsrintro.htm, MG Taylor.

Ansoff, Implanting Strategic Management, Prentice-Hall International, Englewood-Cliffs, NJ, 1984). Currently the weak signals approach is experiencing a renaissance in strategic planning but now either in the context of strategic flexibility or peripheral vision. In this paper we aim, firstly, to present theories describing filters that a weak signal has to pass in the strategy-creation process. Secondly, we present a construction for information filters in the strategy process and prove that the nature of objectives and the method used in environment scanning have a major impact on the outcome. Thirdly, we introduce an application that opens filters for weak signals in the strategy process and thus provides the organization with an opportunity for pro-active decision-making. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Social processes play an important role and companies are forced to deal with such issues more intensively. Identification of such topics is the first and most important step to managing issues. We have conducted interviews with company representatives to understand the companies’ perspective during these early phases. The 42 cases are arranged around the European phase-out of the use of lead-bearing solders in electronics manufacturing in 2006. We found that the outside-in perspective is the main source of information about upcoming issues. Sensing weak signals is the prevailing mechanism to become aware of these topics. Even though hints about the necessity to phase out a technology are known long before, customer push and strict regulatory requirements have been found to be the most important triggers for systematic actions by companies. © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","controversial technologies; issue identification; lead-bearing solders; technology management",,,,,,"Achleitner, P., (1985) Sozio-politische Strategien Multinationaler Unternehmungen, , Bern: Verlag Paul Haupt; Adams, J., (2001) Risk, , London: Routledge; Aerni, P., Risk, regulation and innovation: the case of aquaculture and transgenic fish (2004) Aquatic Sciences, 66, pp. 327-341; Ames, B.N., Gold, L.S., Environmental pollution and cancer: some misconceptions (1993) Phantom Risk: Scientific Interference and the Law, , K.R.

The aim of such systems is to detect changes in an organizational environment ahead of time by scanning the environment for ""weak signals"", which come in the form of trends. Design/methodology/approach - The questions that arise, particularly because the concept of SEWS is not entirely new, are: What are the pitfalls in implementing these systems, why do they occur, and how can they be overcome? To answer these questions, a single case study was conducted. Findings - The study suggests that the failure of SEWS is due mainly to a lack of participation of potential future users in the implementation phase, a lack of joint understanding of the nature of trends, differing and unrevealed requirements of trends by various interested parties, a broad misconception of the ""weak signals"" concept and trends, an excessively heavy reliance on alleged ""hard data"", a lack of interaction among users, and finally a ""missing link"" to the strategic functions in an organization. Research limitations/implications - The results of the study are limited due to the fact that they are derived from a single case study. Originality/value - The identification of pitfalls contributes to the research on implementing SEWS and this can also be linked to ""strategic issue management"" and the foresight process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Germany; Organizational change; Organizational planning; Strategic management",,,,,,"Ackoff, R.L., (1981) Creating the Corporate Future, , John Wiley & Sons Philadelphia, PA; Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , The Macmillan Company New York, NY; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issue management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-48; Baisch, F., (2000) Implementierung von Früherkennungssystemen in Unternehmen, , Josef Eul Verlag Köln; De Geus, A., (1997) The Living Company, , Harvard Business School Boston, MA; Drucker, P.F., (1969) The Age of Discontinuity: Guidelines to Our Changing Society, , Heinemann London; Dutton, J.E., Ottensmeyer, E., Strategic issue management systems: Forms, function, and contexts (1987) Academy of Management Review, 12 (2), pp. 355-65; Dutton, J.E., Fahey, L., Narayanan, V.K., Toward understanding strategic issue diagnosis (1983) Strategic Management Journal, 4, pp. 307-23; Fahey, L., Randall, R.M., Integrating strategy and scenarios (1998) Learning from the Future: Competitive Foresight Scenarios, pp. 22-38. , Fahey, L.

Design/methodology/approach - Early detection and rapid action with respect to developments in the operating environment is a prerequisite for successful marketing planning. Accordingly, this paper proposes a three-stage process for overcoming practical obstacles to the detection and use of weak signals from the operating environment, in particular how to identify relevant and useful documents in harsh information environments such as the internet. Its functionality is demonstrated by means of a human-machine experiment. Findings - A framework based on information foraging theory is well suited to the task of determining the relevance of documents and facilitates the automation of information search processes. A prototype environmental scanning system of this type outperformed human experts in a typical scanning task. Research limitations/implications - Embedding the detection of weak signals in a formal process permits intelligence gatherers to step beyond anecdotal evidence, and complements the current literature on weak signal detection with formal and systematic procedural guidelines. Practical implications - The presented methodology facilitates both the selection and the structuring of information sources. This unburdens the managers and leaves time for important tasks such as the development of concrete marketing plans reacting to detected developments. Originality/value - The paper provides a comprehensive framework for web-based weak signal detection in business environments, and can be used as a string point for the development of practicable environmental scanning systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business environment;

This in turn requires four new competencies which require intense attention to what would have been considered the periphery of the traditional make-and-sell company-the customers and environment. The paper concludes by saying it is important to invest in expanding an organisation's peripheral vision because it will make meaning out of apparent noise; it will extend the number and types of signals that can be sensed; it will drive the development of an ability to transform new signals into meaning; and it enables role-specific management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Building on current conceptual and empirical research, we suggest an analytical approach to the management of surprising and potentially damaging events. In order to do so we propose the wild card management system. Wild cards refer to sudden and unique incidents that can constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend. As the first of the two components of such a wild card system, we advocate a weak signal methodology to take into account those wild cards that can be anticipated by scanning the decision environment. The second component, the nurture of improvisation capabilities, is designed to deal with unanticipated ongoing crises. This paper can be seen as part of a broader agenda on how to manage in conditions of continuous but unpredictable change. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"management; organizational framework",,,,,"van der Heijden, K., Scenarios (1996) The Art of Conversation, , Chichester: John Willey - Sons; Rockfellow, J.D., Wild cards: Preparing for 'Big One' (1994) The Futurist, 1, pp. 14-19. , January-February; Petersen, J.L., (1999) Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises?, , Lanham: Madison; Mitroff, I.I., Pearson, C., Harrington, K., (1996) The Essential Guide to Managing Corporate Crises, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Mitroff, I.I., Pearson, C.M., (1993) Crisis Management: A Diagnostic Guide for Improving Your Organization's Crisis-preparedness, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Mitroff, I.I., Anagnos, G., (2000) Managing Crises Before They Happen: What Every Executive Needs to Know About Crisis Management, , New York, NY: Amacom; Reid, J.L., (2000) Crisis Management: Planning and Media Relations for the Design and Construction Industry, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management: Cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, p. 18. , Winter; Coffman, B.S., Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, January 15, 1997, MG Taylor Corporation; Ansoff, I., (1982) Strategic Response to Turbulent Environments, , Working Paper No. 82-35, Brussels: European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management; Makridakis, S., Wheelwright, S.C., (1989) Forecasting Methods for Management, , New York: John Wiley and Sons Fifth ed; Armstrong, J.S., (2001) Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practioners, , Boston: Kluwer; Preble, J., Reichel, A., The environmental scanning practices of US multinationals in the late 1980's (1988) Management International Review, 28 (4), pp. 4-14; Thomas, P., Environmental scanning: The state of the art (1980) Long Range Planning, 13 (1), pp. 20-25; Renfro, W., (1993) Issues Management in Strategic Planning, , Westport, Connecticut: Quorum Books; Meristö, T., (1991) Scenario Building in the Management of Companies (in Finnish), Finnish Society for Future Studies, Acta Futura Fennica VAPK-Kustannus, 3. , Valtion painatuskeskus, Helsinki; Amara, R., The futures field (1981) Futurist, 15, pp. 25-29; Rubin, A., Kaivo-oja, J., Towards a futures-oriented sociology (1999) Revue Internationale de Sociologie, 9 (3), pp. 349-371; Kamoche, K., Cunha, M.P., Cunha, J.V., (2002) Organizational Improvisation, , (Eds.), London: Routledge; Cunha, M.P., Cunha, J.V., Kamoche, K., Organizational improvisation: What, when, how and why (1999) International Journal of Management Reviews, 1, pp. 299-341; Miner, A.S., Bassoff, P., Moorman, C., Organizational improvisation and learning: A field study (2001) Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, pp. 304-337; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management: Cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, pp. 15-20. , Winter; Weick, K.E., The collapse of sensemaking in organizations: The Mann Gulch disaster (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38, pp. 628-652; Bigley, G.A., Roberts, K.H., The incident command system: High-reliability organizing for complex and volatile task environments (2001) Academy of Management Journal, 44, pp. 1281-1299; Grabowski, M., Roberts, K.H., Risk mitigation in virtual organizations (1999) Organization Science, 10, pp. 704-721; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, pp. 1-34; Adler, P.S., Goldoftas, B., Levine, D.I., Flexibility versus efficiency? a case study of model changeovers in the Toyota production system (1999) Organization Science, 10, pp. 43-68; Lanzara, G.F., Organizing a fashion show (2001) The 1st International Symposium on Organizational Improvisation, , Lisbon, June; Hannan, M.T., Freeman, J., The population ecology of organizations (1977) American Journal of Sociology, 82, pp. 924-964; Argyris, C., (1990) Overcoming Organizational Defenses, , Boston: Allyn and Bacon; Cunha, J.V., Cunha, M.P., Faia-Correia, M., Scenarios for improvisation: Long range planning redeemed (2001) Journal of General Management, 27 (2), pp. 67-80; McGrath, R.G., MacMillan, I.C., Venkataraman, S., Defining and developing competence: A strategic process paradigm (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 251-275; Weick, K.E., The aesthetic of imperfection in orchestras and organizations (1999) Comportamento Organizacional E Gestão, 5, pp. 5-22; Sitkin, S.B., Learning through failure: The strategy of small losses (1992) Research in Organizational Behavior, 14, pp. 231-266. , B.

Key concepts of the article are ""technological ""technological generalization"" and ""leitbild.""

Its most general meaning is a guiding image. Like a common vision, a leitbild creates a shared overall goal, offers orientation toward one long-term overall goal, and provides a basis for different professions and disciplines to work in the same direction. The analysis of leitbilder and emerging technological paradigms might contribute to the construction of topics and issues and to the argumentation processes related to them. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.","Delphi; Foresight; Leitbild; Millennium project; Nanotechnology; Technological generalization; Technological paradigm; Technology foresight; Weak signal","Construction; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Professions; Technological forecasting; future prospect; technological change; technological development",,,,,"Grupp, H., National foresight projects (1999) Technol.

Rather, at least partially, such learning is likely to occur in the course of action. The article also proposes that external pressure can set motion, but it alone does not lead to an environmental paradigm shift. In order to undergo such a shift, organizations will have to learn a meaning of their own to support new, more environmentally sound forms of activity. The present study examines empirically how two companies have learnt to incorporate environmental considerations into their managerial paradigms. It adopts a perspective according to which learning is portrayed as a process in which changes are brought about in the collective beliefs that the organization members hold about the relationship of their business to the natural environment (i.e. environmental management paradigm). Applying the grounded theory approach, the article identifies phases of environmental learning starting from the recognition or rejection of weak signals in 'pockets' of the organization, continuing through the gaining of new knowledge and experience towards 'competition' between old and new assumptions about the business-environment relationship, and finally proceeding to potential frame-break.",,,,,,,"Barrett, S., Murphy, D., The implications of the corporate environmental policy process for human resources management (1995) Greener Management International, 10, pp. 49-68; Bartunek, J., Changing interpretative schemes and organizational restructuring: The example of a religious order (1984) Administrative Science Quarterly, 29 (3), pp. 355-372; Bartunek, J., The dynamics of personal and organizational refraining (1988) Paradox and Transformation: Towards a Theory of Change in Organization and Management, pp. 137-162. , Quinn, R. and Cameron, K.

The conventional methods of project control are not really capable of rising to these challenges. The early warnings observed in project-related activities or the weak signals as described in Igor Ansoff's theory enable project managers to better anticipate and manage otherwise unforeseeable project problems. This article explains the character of the phenomenon and some other related factors. It shows how early warnings relate to project problems and their causes, and develops a preliminary model for the utilisation of early warnings.

Buyback announcement returns are also increasing in the fraction of shares sought, which is consistent with both signalling and an upward‐sloping supply curve for stock. 1991 The American Finance Association",,,,,,,"Akerlof, G., The market for lemons: Qualitative uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, pp. 488-500; Asquith, P., Mullins, D., Equity issues and offering dilution (1986) Journal of Financial Economics, 15, pp. 61-89; Bagwell, L.S., (1988), Share repurchase and takeover deterrence, Working paper, Northwestern University; Bagwell, L.S., (1989), Dutch auction repurchase: An analysis of shareholder heterogeneity, Working paper, Northwestern University; Bagwell, L.S., Shoven, J.B., Cash distributions to shareholders (1989) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 3, pp. 129-140; Barclay, M., Smith, C., Corporate payout policy: Cash dividends versus open‐market repurchases (1988) Journal of Financial Economics, 12, pp. 187-209; Bhattacharya, S., Imperfect information, dividend policy, and the ‘bird in the hand’ fallacy (1979) The Bell Journal of Economics, 10, pp. 259-270; Brennan, M., Thakor, A., Shareholder preferences and dividend policy (1990) The Journal of Finance, 45, pp. 993-1018; Choe, H., Masulis, R., Nanda, V., (1989), On the timing of seasoned common stock issues: Theory and evidence, Working paper, Southern Methodist University; Dann, L., Common stock repurchases: An analysis of returns to bondholders and stockholders (1981) Journal of Financial Economics, 9, pp. 113-138; Denis, D., Defensive changes in corporate payout policy: Share repurchases and special dividends (1990) The Journal of Finance, 45, pp. 1433-1456; Gay, G.D., Kale, J.R., Noe, T.H., (1990), Dutch auction share repurchases: Bidding strategies, tender premiums, and information content, Working paper, Georgia State University; Giammarino, R.M., Lewis, T., A theory of negotiated equity financing (1988) Review of Financial Studies, 1, pp. 265-288; John, K., Williams, J., dividends, dilution and taxes: A signalling equilibrium (1985) The Journal of Finance, 40, pp. 1053-1070; Jensen, M.C., Meckling, W.H., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and capital structure (1976) Journal of Financial Economics, 3, pp. 305-360; Kadapakkam, P.R., Seth, S., (1991), Capital gains taxes and stockholders' response to tender offers: Evidence from dutch auction repurchases, Working paper, University of Houston; Kale, J.T., Noe, Gay, G., Share repurchase through transferable put rights: Analysis and case study (1989) Journal of Financial Economics, 25, pp. 141-160; Korajczyk, R., Lucas, D., McDonald, R.L., (1989) Asymmetric Information, Corporate Finance, and Investment, , R.

The authors stress the need to monitor different environmental areas through a set of Environmental Descriptors indicating the developments, trends and events in the environment. These Descriptors are visible in the form of weak signals. The authors link the impact of these Descriptors on the long-range planning system of a company through a set of Environmental Indicators and their Influence Diagrams. The process of monitoring is carried out by a group of managers who act as Environmental Radars. The role of Radars is to monitor the Descriptors, intercept and amplify the weak signals using an Environmental Data Base and generate the Environmental Scenarios. The system works on a continuous basis and assists top management in defining the size and direction of strategies and programmes for achieving long-range objectives. © 1987.",,"ECONOMICS - Management; SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND CYBERNETICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING; LONG-RANGE PLANNING; INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT",,,,,"King, Cleland, (1978) Strategic Planning and Policy, , Van Nostrand Reinhold, Scarborough, U.S.A; Ramachandran, Kumar, Narchal, Corporate planning practices in Indian public sector enterprises—a state of art (1982) Proceedings of National Seminar on Corporate Strategic Planning; Fahey, King, Narayanan, Environmental scanning and forecasting in strategic planning—the state of the art (1981) Long Range Planning, 14, pp. 32-39; Hussey, (1982) Corporate Planning: Theory and Practice, , Pergamon Press, Oxford; Reinhardt, Early warning systems for strategic planning (1984) Long Range Planning, 17, pp. 25-34; Steiner, (1979) Strategic Planning, , Free Press, New York; Dixit, Environmental scanning for corporate planning (1984) Productivity, 25, pp. 217-229; Seth, Environmental factors and strategic planning (1984) Productivity, 25, pp. 231-242","Narchal, R.M.; National Productivity CouncilIndia",,,,,,,,00246301,,,,"English","Long Range Plann.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023570550
