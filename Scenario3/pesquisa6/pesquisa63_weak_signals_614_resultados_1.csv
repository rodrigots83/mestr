Stochastic resonance (SR) is a nonlinear, statistical dynamics whereby information flow in a multistate system is enhanced by the presence of optimized, random noise1-4. A major consequence of SR for signal reception is that it makes possible substantial improvements in the detection of weak periodic signals. Although SR has recently been demonstrated in several artificial physical systems5,6, it may also occur naturally, and an intriguing possibility is that biological systems have evolved the capability to exploit SR by optimizing endogenous sources of noise. Sensory systems are an obvious place to look for SR, as they excel at detecting weak signals in a noisy environment. Here we demonstrate SR using external noise applied to crayfish mechanoreceptor cells. Our results show that individual neurons can provide a physiological substrate for SR in sensory systems. © 1993 Nature Publishing Group.",,"article; crayfish; mechanoreceptor; noise; nonhuman; priority journal; statistics; Action Potentials; Animal; Astacoidea; Electromagnetics; In Vitro; Mechanoreceptors; Neural Conduction; Neurons, Afferent; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Astacoidea; Astacoidea",,,,,"Fa Uve, S., Heslot, F., (1983) Phys.

The nature of ISDTs is articulated using Dubin's concept of theory building and Simon's idea of a science of the artificial. An example of an ISDT is presented in the context of Executive Information Systems (EIS). Despite the increasing awareness of the potential of EIS for enhancing executive strategic decisionmaking effectiveness, there exists little theoretical work which directly guides EIS design. We contend that the underlying theoretical basis of EIS can be addressed through a design theory of vigilant information systems. Vigilance denotes the ability of an information system to help an executive remain alertly watchful for weak signals and discontinuities in the organizational environment relevant to emerging strategic threats and opportunities. Research on managerial information scanning and emerging issue tracking as well as theories of open loop control are synthesized to generate vigilant information system design theory propositions. Transformation of the propositions into testable empirical hypotheses is discussed. Copyright © 1992.

If the end user of the image will be a human, model observers are used to predict the task performance of the human as measured by psychophysical studies, and hence to serve as the basis for optimization of image quality. In this paper we consider the task of detection of a weak signal in a noisy image. The mathematical observers considered include the ideal Bayesian, the nonprewhitening matched filter, a model based on linear-discriminant analysis and referred to as the Hotelling observer, and the Hotelling and Bayesian observers modified to account for the spatial-frequency-selective channels in the human visual system. The theory behind these observer models is briefly reviewed, and several psychophysical studies relating to the choice among them are summarized. Only the Hotelling model with channels is mathematically tractable in all cases considered here and capable of accounting for all of these data. This model requires no adjustment of parameters to fit the data and is relatively insensitive to the details of the channel mechanism. We therefore suggest it as a useful model observer for the purpose of assessing and optimizing image quality with respect to simple detection tasks.",,"bayes theorem; collimator; conference paper; discriminant analysis; human; human experiment; image processing; image quality; mathematical model; priority journal; signal detection; spatial frequency discrimination; white noise; Discrimination (Psychology); Human; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Models, Psychological; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Visual Perception",,,,,"Swets, J., (1988) Science, 240, pp. 1285-1293; Swets, J., Pickett, R.M., (1982) Evaluation of Diagnostic Systems: Methods from Signal Detection Theory, , Academic, New York; Metz, C.E., (1986) Invest.

The detectors considered consist of a zero-memory nonlinearity (ZNL) followed by a linear filter whose output is compared with a threshold. That this class of detectors is a reasonable one to study is apparent from the fact that both the Neyman-Pearson optimum and the locally optimum (i.e., weak-signal optimum) detectors for statistically independent noise samples can be put into this form. The measure of detector performance used is the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the nonlinear detector under study with respect to a linear detector appropriate for the same detection problem. A general expression for this ARE is given along with the result that the nonlinearity maximizing this expression is any linear function of the nonlinearity in the appropriate constant-signal locally optimum detector. To illustrate the structure and performance of these nonlinear detectors for a wide range of non-Gaussian noise distributions, three general classes of symmetric, unimodal, univariate probability density functions are introduced that are generalizations of the Gaussian, Cauchy, and beta distributions. © 1972, IEEE.

Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planetâ €™ s formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A single calmodulin (CaM) molecule associates constitutively with the channel's carboxy-terminal tail, and Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal and N-terminal lobes of CaM can each induce distinct channel regulations. As expected from close channel proximity, the C-lobe responds to the roughly 100-μM Ca2+ pulses driven by the associated channel, a behaviour defined as 'local Ca2+ selectivity'. Conversely, all previous observations have indicated that the N-lobe somehow senses the far weaker signals from distant Ca2+ sources. This 'global Ca2+ selectivity' satisfies a general signalling requirement, enabling a resident molecule to remotely sense cellular Ca2+ activity, which would otherwise be overshadowed by Ca2+ entry through the host channel. Here we show that the spatial Ca2+ selectivity of N-lobe CaM regulation is not invariably global but can be switched by a novel Ca 2+/CaM-binding site within the amino terminus of channels (NSCaTE, for N-terminal spatial Ca2+ transforming element). Native Ca V2.2 channels lack this element and show N-lobe regulation with a global selectivity. On the introduction of NSCaTE into these channels, spatial Ca2+ selectivity transforms from a global to local profile. Given this effect, we examined CaV1.2/CaV1.3 channels, which naturally contain NSCaTE, and found that their N-lobe selectivity is indeed local. Disruption of this element produces a global selectivity, confirming the native function of NSCaTE. Thus, differences in spatial selectivity between advanced CaV1 and CaV2 channel isoforms are explained by the presence or absence of NSCaTE. Beyond functional effects, the position of NSCaTE on the channel's amino terminus indicates that CaM can bridge the amino terminus and carboxy terminus of channels. Finally, the modularity of NSCaTE offers practical means for understanding the basis of global Ca2+ selectivity. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,"calcium channel; calcium ion; calmodulin; biological analysis; cation; molecular analysis; protein; spatial analysis; article; binding affinity; calcium transport; channel gating; dissociation constant; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; Xanthomonas",,"calcium ion, 14127-61-8",,,"Lee, A., Scheuer, T., Catterall, W.A., Ca2+/calmodulin- dependent facilitation and inactivation of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels (2000) J.

How can they see these changes sooner and capitalize on them? Such changes often begin as weak signals on what the authors call the periphery, or the blurry zone at the edge of an organization's vision. As with human peripheral vision, these signals are difficult to see and interpret but can be vital to success or survival. Unfortunately, most companies lack a systematic method for determining where on the periphery they should be looking, how to interpret the weak signals they see, and how to allocate limited scanning resources. This article provides such a method-a question-based framework for helping companies scan the periphery more efficiently and effectively. The framework divides questions into three categories: learning from the past (What have been our past blind spots? What instructive analogies do other industries offer? Who in the industry is skilled at picking up weak signals and acting on them?); evaluating the present (What important signals are we rationalizing away? What are our mavericks, outliers, complainers, and defectors telling us? What are our peripheral customers and competitors really thinking?); and envisioning the future (What future surprises could really hurt or help us? What emerging technologies could change the game? Is there an unthinkable scenario that might disrupt our business?). Answering these questions is a good first step toward anticipating problems or opportunities that may appear on the business horizon. The article concludes with a self-test that companies can use to assess their need and capability for peripheral vision.",,"commercial phenomena; economic aspect; organization and management; review; United States; Commerce; Economic Competition; United States",,,,,,"Day, G.S.; Department of Marketing, University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, United States; email: dayg@wharton.upenn.edu",,,,,,,,00178012,,HABRA,"16299966","English","Harv.

An efficient copyright protection method that has been gaining popularity is watermarking, i.e., the embedding of a signature in a digital document that can be detected only by its rightful owner. Watermarks are usually blindly detected using correlating structures, which would be optimal in the case of Gaussian data. However, in the case of DCT-domain image watermarking, the data is more heavy-tailed and the correlator is clearly suboptimal. Nonlinear receivers have been shown to be particularly well suited for the detection of weak signals in heavy-tailed noise, as they are locally optimal. This motivates the use of the Gaussian-tailed zero-memory nonlinearity, as well as the locally optimal Cauchy nonlinearity for the detection of watermarks in DCT transformed images. We analyze the performance of these schemes theoretically and compare it to that of the traditionally used Gaussian correlator, but also to the recently proposed generalized Gaussian detector, which outperforms the correlator. The theoretical analysis and the actual performance of these systems is assessed through experiments, which verify the theoretical analysis and also justify the use of nonlinear structures for watermark detection. The performance of the correlator and the nonlinear detectors in the presence of quantization is also analyzed, using results from dither theory, and also verified experimentally. © 2004 IEEE.","Alpha-stable distributions; Locally optimal detection; Neyman-Pearson; Statistical modeling; Watermarking","Approximation theory; Copyrights; Cosine transforms; Digital watermarking; Mathematical models; Probability density function; Statistics; Vector quantization; Alpha stable distributions; Gaussian likelihood ratio; Image watermarking; Locally optimal detection; Neyman-Pearson statistical modeling; Image processing; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; computer security; evaluation; hypermedia; information retrieval; methodology; nonlinear system; packaging; patent; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; statistical model; validation study; Algorithms; Computer Graphics; Computer Security; Hypermedia; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Nonlinear Dynamics; Patents; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Product Labeling; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",,,,,"Schneider, B., (1996) Applied Cryptography, , 2nd ed.

Building on current conceptual and empirical research, we suggest an analytical approach to the management of surprising and potentially damaging events. In order to do so we propose the wild card management system. Wild cards refer to sudden and unique incidents that can constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend. As the first of the two components of such a wild card system, we advocate a weak signal methodology to take into account those wild cards that can be anticipated by scanning the decision environment. The second component, the nurture of improvisation capabilities, is designed to deal with unanticipated ongoing crises. This paper can be seen as part of a broader agenda on how to manage in conditions of continuous but unpredictable change. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"management; organizational framework",,,,,"van der Heijden, K., Scenarios (1996) The Art of Conversation, , Chichester: John Willey - Sons; Rockfellow, J.D., Wild cards: Preparing for 'Big One' (1994) The Futurist, 1, pp. 14-19. , January-February; Petersen, J.L., (1999) Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises?, , Lanham: Madison; Mitroff, I.I., Pearson, C., Harrington, K., (1996) The Essential Guide to Managing Corporate Crises, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Mitroff, I.I., Pearson, C.M., (1993) Crisis Management: A Diagnostic Guide for Improving Your Organization's Crisis-preparedness, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Mitroff, I.I., Anagnos, G., (2000) Managing Crises Before They Happen: What Every Executive Needs to Know About Crisis Management, , New York, NY: Amacom; Reid, J.L., (2000) Crisis Management: Planning and Media Relations for the Design and Construction Industry, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management: Cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, p. 18. , Winter; Coffman, B.S., Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, January 15, 1997, MG Taylor Corporation; Ansoff, I., (1982) Strategic Response to Turbulent Environments, , Working Paper No. 82-35, Brussels: European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management; Makridakis, S., Wheelwright, S.C., (1989) Forecasting Methods for Management, , New York: John Wiley and Sons Fifth ed; Armstrong, J.S., (2001) Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practioners, , Boston: Kluwer; Preble, J., Reichel, A., The environmental scanning practices of US multinationals in the late 1980's (1988) Management International Review, 28 (4), pp. 4-14; Thomas, P., Environmental scanning: The state of the art (1980) Long Range Planning, 13 (1), pp. 20-25; Renfro, W., (1993) Issues Management in Strategic Planning, , Westport, Connecticut: Quorum Books; Meristö, T., (1991) Scenario Building in the Management of Companies (in Finnish), Finnish Society for Future Studies, Acta Futura Fennica VAPK-Kustannus, 3. , Valtion painatuskeskus, Helsinki; Amara, R., The futures field (1981) Futurist, 15, pp. 25-29; Rubin, A., Kaivo-oja, J., Towards a futures-oriented sociology (1999) Revue Internationale de Sociologie, 9 (3), pp. 349-371; Kamoche, K., Cunha, M.P., Cunha, J.V., (2002) Organizational Improvisation, , (Eds.), London: Routledge; Cunha, M.P., Cunha, J.V., Kamoche, K., Organizational improvisation: What, when, how and why (1999) International Journal of Management Reviews, 1, pp. 299-341; Miner, A.S., Bassoff, P., Moorman, C., Organizational improvisation and learning: A field study (2001) Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, pp. 304-337; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management: Cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, pp. 15-20. , Winter; Weick, K.E., The collapse of sensemaking in organizations: The Mann Gulch disaster (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38, pp. 628-652; Bigley, G.A., Roberts, K.H., The incident command system: High-reliability organizing for complex and volatile task environments (2001) Academy of Management Journal, 44, pp. 1281-1299; Grabowski, M., Roberts, K.H., Risk mitigation in virtual organizations (1999) Organization Science, 10, pp. 704-721; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, pp. 1-34; Adler, P.S., Goldoftas, B., Levine, D.I., Flexibility versus efficiency? a case study of model changeovers in the Toyota production system (1999) Organization Science, 10, pp. 43-68; Lanzara, G.F., Organizing a fashion show (2001) The 1st International Symposium on Organizational Improvisation, , Lisbon, June; Hannan, M.T., Freeman, J., The population ecology of organizations (1977) American Journal of Sociology, 82, pp. 924-964; Argyris, C., (1990) Overcoming Organizational Defenses, , Boston: Allyn and Bacon; Cunha, J.V., Cunha, M.P., Faia-Correia, M., Scenarios for improvisation: Long range planning redeemed (2001) Journal of General Management, 27 (2), pp. 67-80; McGrath, R.G., MacMillan, I.C., Venkataraman, S., Defining and developing competence: A strategic process paradigm (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 251-275; Weick, K.E., The aesthetic of imperfection in orchestras and organizations (1999) Comportamento Organizacional E Gestão, 5, pp. 5-22; Sitkin, S.B., Learning through failure: The strategy of small losses (1992) Research in Organizational Behavior, 14, pp. 231-266. , B.

However, in cerebellum c-erbAβ1 mRNA levels were very low. Since cerebellar development, including dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells, is a T3-sensitive process, we assessed the levels of the β1 receptor protein in cerebellum during development. Antisera to unique peptide regions of β1 were raised. Their specificity was demonstrated by specific immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translated product, 85% immunoprecipitation of the T3 binding activity in hepatic nuclear extracts, and Western blot analysis of tissue extracts. Immunohistochemical studies using anti-β1 antiserum stained liver nuclei but not testis nuclei, which contain no T3 binding activity or β1 mRNA. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, an immunofluorescent signal, localized to the nucleus and more intense than that seen in the liver, was observed. A positive but weaker signal was also present in the granule cells. Thus, we may infer that the cerebellum contains significant concentrations of β1 receptor protein despite the low β1 mRNA content. Both the intensity of staining in Purkinje cell nuclei and immunopreeipitable β1 receptor binding capacity rose in the neonatal Period. Antiserum to the non-T3 binding α2 variant protein was also prepared and a distinctive pattern of fluorescence was observed. Strong fluorescence was seen in the nuclei of granule cells, but none was seen in Purkinje cells. The α2 fluorescence in testis was high, consistent with the high levels of α2 mRNA in this tissue. The fluorescent signal appeared to originate primarily in dividing spermatogonia. Our findings support the concept that the β1 receptor plays a central role in T3-induced brain development and strongly suggest that the Purkinje cell in a direct target for T3.","c-erbA; Immunohistochemistry; Neurons; Ontogeny; Triiodothyronine","liothyronine; thyroid hormone; thyroid hormone receptor; animal tissue; article; brain development; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; nonhuman; priority journal; protein localization; purkinje cell; rat; Amino Acid Sequence; Animal; Brain; Cell Nucleus; Cerebellum; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Gene Expression; Liver; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Purkinje Cells; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Receptors, Thyroid Hormone; RNA, Messenger; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Testis; Triiodothyronine; Animalia",,"Peptides; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Receptors, Thyroid Hormone; RNA, Messenger; Triiodothyronine, 6893-02-3",,,"Legrand, J., (1967) Microsc.

The first-minimalism- emphasizes public interventions that incorporate market concepts and practices while also centralizing and minimizing administrative discretion. The second- experimentalism-emphasizes interventions in which the central government affords broad discretion to local administrative units but measures and assesses their performance in ways designed to induce continuous learning and revision of standards. Minimalism has been prominent in legal scholarship and in the policy discourse of recent presidential administrations, but its practical impact has been surprisingly limited. By contrast, experimentalism, which has had a lower profile in academic and public discussion, has visibly influenced a broad range of critical policy initiatives in the United States and abroad. Indeed, key initiatives of the Obama Administration, including the Food Safety Modernization Act and the Race to the Top education program, are virtually unintelligible from any other perspective. We argue that, in practice, minimalism suffers from an excessive preoccupation with static efficiency norms and price signals, and from insufficient attention to learning and ""weak signals"" of risk and opportunity. Experimentalist intervention is a more promising approach in the growing realm of policy challenges characterized by uncertainty about both the definition of the relevant problems and the solutions. © 2011, Charles F.

A sequential adaptive sampling-and-refinement procedure called Distilled Sensing (DS) is proposed and analyzed. DS is a form of multistage experimental design and testing. Because of the adaptive nature of the data collection, DS can detect and localize far weaker signals than possible from non-adaptive measurements. In particular, reliable detection and localization (support estimation) using non-adaptive samples is possible only if the signal amplitudes grow logarithmically with the problem dimension. Here it is shown that using adaptive sampling, reliable detection is possible provided the amplitude exceeds a constant, and localization is possible when the amplitude exceeds any arbitrarily slowly growing function of the dimension. © 2011 IEEE.","Adaptive sampling; experimental design; multiple hypothesis testing; sequential sensing; sparse recovery","Adaptive sampling; Data collection; Detection and estimation; Multiple hypothesis testing; Reliable detection; sequential sensing; Signal amplitude; Sparse recovery; Sparse signals; White Gaussian Noise; Gaussian noise (electronic); Statistics; Signal detection",,,,,"Abramovich, F., Benjamini, Y., Donoho, D., Johnstone, I., Adapting to unknown sparsity by controlling the false discovery rate (2006) Ann.

The method uses a statistic computed from the sample bispectrum of a sampled record of the signal-plus-noise of length T = Nτ, where l/τ is the sampling rate. The key result underlying the method is that the bispectrum of the noise is zero in a triangle that is a proper subset of the principal domain triangle. It is shown that the probability of detecting the signal is high if (3/16)1/2N5/6 is larger than ρ-1 where ρ is the energy signal-to-noise ratio. This result implies that the bispectrum based test may detect a weak signal of unknown form which evades detection by other methods. © 1990 IEEE",,"Signal Detection; Bispectral Analysis; Transient Waveforms; Weak Signals; Spectrum Analysis",,,,,"Papadopoulos, C.K., Nikias, C.L., Bispectrum estimation of transient signals (1988) Proc.

A new methodology for analyzing trends in the timing of flood events is developed that takes into account the directional character and multi-modality of flood occurrences. The methodology transforms the directional series of flood occurrences into new series by defining a new location of the origin. A test of flood seasonality (multi-modality) is then applied to identify dominant flood seasons. Floods from the dominant seasons are analyzed separately by a seasonal trend analysis. The Mann-Kendall test in conjunction with the method of pre-whitening is used in the trend analysis. Over 160 streamflow records from one common observation period are analyzed in watersheds with relatively pristine and stable land-use conditions. The results show weak signals of climate variability and/or change present in the timing of floods in Canada during the last three decades. Most of the significant trends in the timing of spring snowmelt floods are negative trends (earlier flood occurrence) found in the southern part of Canada. There are no significant trends identified in the timing of fall rainfall floods. However, the significance of the fall, rainfall-dominated flood season has been increasing in several analyzed watersheds. This may indicate increasing intensity of rainfall events during the recent years. Trends in the magnitude of floods are more pronounced than the trends in the timing of floods. Almost one fifth of all the analyzed stations show significant trends in the magnitude of snowmelt floods. Most of the significant trends are negative trends, suggesting decreasing magnitudes of snowmelt floods in Canada over the last three decades. Significant negative trends are found particularly in southern Ontario, northern Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. There are no significant trends in the magnitude of rainfall floods found in the analyzed streamflow records. The results support the outcomes of previous streamflow trend studies conducted in Canada. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We view cosponsorship as a signal about the content of legislation and ask whether it is a meaningful signal for members. Specifically we focus on whether cosponsorship influences a bill's passage. Three types of signals are considered: bandwagon, ideological, and expertise. Using data drawn from the 99th Congress, we analyze 8,002 House and Senate bills. Our findings show that cosponsorship is common. However, they also show that it is an overrated cue. At best it provides a signal concerning expertise at the outset of the legislative process, but generates a very weak signal thereafter.

Weak signals are current oddities, strange issues that are thought to be in key position in anticipating future changes in organizational environments. Scanning for them and using them in scenario work is thought to be successful for looking to the future. However, defining weak signals is problematic, and various authors term the concept differently. The debate about the characteristics of weak signals has been active especially in Finland. The article aims to develop a deeper theoretical understanding of weak signals. For this purpose, a semiotic approach, Peirce's triadic model of sign in particular, is used. The article introduces a new starting point for defining weak signals (signs) by using the novel concept future sign, which consists of three dimensions: the signal, the issue and the interpretation. © 2007.",,"modeling; organizational change; signal; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Contrib Title: Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, XVIII (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Contrib Title: Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; I.H.

The relationship between proxies and temperature is weak and the number of proxies is far larger than the number of target data points. Furthermore, the data contain complex spatial and temporal dependence structures which are not easily captured with simple models. In this paper, we assess the reliability of such reconstructions and their statistical significance against various null models. We find that the proxies do not predict temperature significantly better than random series generated independently of temperature. Furthermore, various model specifications that perform similarly at predicting temperature produce extremely different historical backcasts. Finally, the proxies seem unable to forecast the high levels of and sharp run-up in temperature in the 1990s either in-sample or from contiguous holdout blocks, thus casting doubt on their ability to predict such phenomena if in fact they occurred several hundred years ago. We propose our own reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere average annual land temperature over the last millennium, assess its reliability, and compare it to those from the climate science literature. Our model provides a similar reconstruction but has much wider standard errors, reflecting the weak signal and large uncertainty encountered in this setting. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2011.","Climate change; Cross-validation; Global warming; Model validation; Paleoclimatology; Temperature reconstruction; Time series",,,,,,"Amman, C.M., Joos, F., Otto-Bliesner, B.L., Tomas, R., Solar influence on climate during the past millennium: Results from transient simulations with the NCAR climate system model (2007) Proc.

Ansoff, Implanting Strategic Management, Prentice-Hall International, Englewood-Cliffs, NJ, 1984). Currently the weak signals approach is experiencing a renaissance in strategic planning but now either in the context of strategic flexibility or peripheral vision. In this paper we aim, firstly, to present theories describing filters that a weak signal has to pass in the strategy-creation process. Secondly, we present a construction for information filters in the strategy process and prove that the nature of objectives and the method used in environment scanning have a major impact on the outcome. Thirdly, we introduce an application that opens filters for weak signals in the strategy process and thus provides the organization with an opportunity for pro-active decision-making. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though existing methods have successfully been used to explore structure-function relationships in nervous systems, to profile RNA in situ, to reveal the heterogeneity of tumour microenvironments and to study dynamic macromolecular assembly, it remains challenging to image many species with high selectivity and sensitivity under biological conditions. For instance, fluorescence microscopy faces a â € colour barrier', owing to the intrinsically broad (about 1,500 inverse centimetres) and featureless nature of fluorescence spectra that limits the number of resolvable colours to two to five (or seven to nine if using complicated instrumentation and analysis). Spontaneous Raman microscopy probes vibrational transitions with much narrower resonances (peak width of about 10 inverse centimetres) and so does not suffer from this problem, but weak signals make many bio-imaging applications impossible. Although surface-enhanced Raman scattering offers high sensitivity and multiplicity, it cannot be readily used to image specific molecular targets quantitatively inside live cells. Here we use stimulated Raman scattering under electronic pre-resonance conditions to image target molecules inside living cells with very high vibrational selectivity and sensitivity (down to 250 nanomolar with a time constant of 1 millisecond). We create a palette of triple-bond-conjugated near-infrared dyes that each displays a single peak in the cell-silent Raman spectral window; when combined with available fluorescent probes, this palette provides 24 resolvable colours, with the potential for further expansion. Proof-of-principle experiments on neuronal co-cultures and brain tissues reveal cell-type-dependent heterogeneities in DNA and protein metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions, underscoring the potential of this 24-colour (super-multiplex) optical imaging approach for elucidating intricate interactions in complex biological systems. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Yet due to their inherent flexibility, open-market repurchase programs have long been criticized as weak signals lacking commitment. We evaluate whether some managers potentially use buyback announcements to mislead investors. We focus on cases where managers were seemingly under heavy pressure to boost stock prices and might have announced a repurchase only to convey a false signal. For suspect cases, the immediate market reaction to a buyback announcement does not differ from that generally observed. However over longer horizons, suspect firms do not enjoy the improvement in economic performance otherwise observed. Suspect firms repurchase less stock. Further, managers in suspect firms have comparatively higher exposure to stock options, a potentially endogenous result suggesting greater sensitivity to both stock valuation and to future equity dilution. Overall, the results suggest only a limited number of managers may have used buybacks in a misleading way as ""cheap talk."" Yet as theory also suggests, we find no long-run economic benefit to this behavior. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

LO detection has been extensively studied for classical detection scenarios but general results for LO distributed detection, specifically for dependent sensor observations, have been lacking. The necessary conditions are presented for the LO distributed sensor detector designs and fusion rule for an N sensor parallel distributed detection system with dependent sensor observations, and specific solutions are obtained for a random signal in additive noise detection problem with two sensors. These solutions indicate that the LO sensor detector nonlinearities, in general, contain a term proportional to f ’f, where f is the noise probability density function (pdf). The importance of this term varies with the additive noise pdf and the false alarm probability. For some non-Gaussian pdfs, the new term is significant and causes the LO sensor detector nonlinearities to be nonsymmetric even for symmetric pdfs. LO solutions are presented for finite sample sizes and the LO solutions are discussed in the asymptotic case. These results are extended to yield the form of the solutions for the N sensor LO random signal distributed detection problem, that yields expected generalizations of the two sensor results. © 1992 IEEE","decentralized detection; dependent observations; distributed detection; Locally optimum; random signal detection","Noise, Spurious Signal; Probability - Random Processes; Distributed Detection; Probability Density Functions; Random Signals; Signal Detection",,,,,"Longo, M., Lookabaugh, T., Gray, R.M., Quantization for decentralized hypothesis testing under communication constraints (1990) IEEE Trans.

Among other things, networks keep them up-to-date with changes in the economy and allow them to take advantage of opportunities to innovate, thus remaining ahead of their competitors. The networks - personal or business - with which these firms interact the most are usually geographically or sociologically close by, embedded in the environment, and are known as strong tie networks. They generally supply signals in a familiar language, based on habit as well a good reciprocal knowledge, which are easy to understand. In addition to this, however, the most dynamic firms also have contacts with weak tie networks, which are further removed from the usual behaviours of entrepreneurs and provide weak signals that, while difficult to grasp and decode, nevertheless offer new, pre-competitive information that can support major innovations. Very little empirical research has been done so far to test the probability of this theory. This paper reports on the results of a survey involving 147 SMEs, all in the land-based transportation equipment sector. It confirms the importance of weak tie networks as opposed to other types of networks, recognizing their complementary contribution to technological innovation. The organization's absorptive capacity is also found to be a significant intermediary factor in taking advantage of weak tie networks. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.","Absorptive capacity; SMEs; Strong and weak signals; Strong tie networks; Technological innovation; Weak tie networks","competition (economics); entrepreneur; innovation; small and medium-sized enterprise; technological development",,,,,"Albernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Innovation mapping the winds of creature destruction (1985) Research Policy, 14 (1), pp. 3-22; Amendola, M., Gaffard, J., (1988) la Dynamique Économique de L'innovation, , Paris: Economica; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Birley, S., Cromie, S., Myers, A., Entrepreneurial networks: Their emergence in Ireland and overseas (1991) International Small Business Journal, 9 (4), pp. 56-74; Bourdieu, P., (1967) Choses Dites, , Paris: Édition de Minuit; Brush, C., Market place information scanning activities of new manufacturing ventures (1992) Journal of Small Business Management, 30 (4), pp. 41-53; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Carrier, C., Garand, D., (1996) le Concept D'innovation: Débats et Ambiguités, , Communication to the 5th International Conference on Strategic Management, Lille, 13-15 May; Chollet, B., (2002) L'analyse des Réscaux Sociaux: Quelques Implications Pour le Champ de L'entrepreneuriat, , Communication to the 6th International French Speaking Congress on Small Business, 29 Oct-1 Nov, Montréal, Québec; Choo, C.W., (1999) The Intelligent Organization: Mobilizing Organizational Knowledge Through Information Partnerships, , Working Papers, Information Studies Department, Toronto University, Toronto; Cohen, W., Levinthal, D., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (1), pp. 128-152; Cohen, W., Levinthal, D., Fortune favors the prepared firm (1994) Management Science, 40, pp. 227-251; Collinson, S., Knowledge networks for innovation in small Scottish software firms (2000) Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 12, pp. 217-244; Dewar, R., Dutton, J., The adoption of radical and incremental innovations: An empirical analysis (1986) Management Science, 32, pp. 1422-1433; Drakopoulou Dodd, S., Patra, E., National difference in entrepreneurial networking (2002) Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 14 (2), pp. 117-134; Eliasson, G., (1990) The Knowledge-based Information Economy, , (ed.)

The conventional methods of project control are not really capable of rising to these challenges. The early warnings observed in project-related activities or the weak signals as described in Igor Ansoff's theory enable project managers to better anticipate and manage otherwise unforeseeable project problems. This article explains the character of the phenomenon and some other related factors. It shows how early warnings relate to project problems and their causes, and develops a preliminary model for the utilisation of early warnings.

This paper analyses the use of different horizon scanning approaches and methods as applied in the Scanning for Emerging Science and Technology Issues project. A comparative analysis is provided as well as a brief evaluation the needs of policy-makers if they are to identify areas in which policy needs to be formulated. This paper suggests that the selection of the best scanning approaches and methods is subject to contextual and content issues.

What are the shaping forces, or sources of change and what might be their impacts, particularly where these may create entirely new challenges and opportunities? Futures experts (attendees of the FTA 2008 Conference) were invited to state their opinions on these questions by considering the trends, drivers, wilds cards, discontinuities and weak signals likely to shape the future through the Big Picture Survey. The survey was launched 6 months prior to the Conference. More than 250 responses were submitted by the Conference date. The results collected were synthesised and presented back to the attendees in a plenary presentation by the authors. The current paper aims to clarify the concepts first by suggesting definitions and discussing the distinctions between them. The paper then presents the rationales of conducting the Big Picture Survey (BPS), presents its methodology and discusses the results of the survey in a greater extent. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"survey; twenty first century; Canada; United Kingdom",,,,,"van Rij V.

Most people would not be surprised if Smith is a hardened criminal. Guilt-by-association methods combine weak signals to derive stronger ones, and have been extensively used for anomaly detection and classification in numerous settings (e.g., accounting fraud, cyber-security, calling-card fraud). The focus of this paper is to compare and contrast several very successful, guilt-by-association methods: Random Walk with Restarts, Semi-Supervised Learning, and Belief Propagation (BP). Our main contributions are two-fold: (a) theoretically, we prove that all the methods result in a similar matrix inversion problem; (b) for practical applications, we developed FaBP, a fast algorithm that yields 2× speedup, equal or higher accuracy than BP, and is guaranteed to converge. We demonstrate these benefits using synthetic and real datasets, including YahooWeb, one of the largest graphs ever studied with BP. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Belief Propagation; inference; probabilistic graphical models; Random Walk with Restart; Semi-Supervised Learning","Belief propagation; inference; Probabilistic graphical models; Random walk with restart; Semi-supervised learning; Algorithms; Computer crime; Crime; Image retrieval; Learning systems; Random processes; Backpropagation",,,,,"Hadoop Information, , http://hadoop.apache.org/; Brin, S., Page, L., The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine (1998) Computer Networks, 30, pp. 1-7; Chau, D.H., Nachenberg, C., Wilhelm, J., Wright, A., Faloutsos, C., Polonium: Tera-scale graph mining and inference for malware detection (2011) SDM; Chechetka, A., Guestrin, C., Focused belief propagation for query-specific inference International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) (May 2010); Christakis, N.A., Fowler, J.H., The spread of obesity in a large social network over 32 years (2007) New England Journal of Medicine, 357 (4), pp. 370-379; Felzenszwalb, P., Huttenlocher, D., Efficient belief propagation for early vision (2006) International Journal of Computer Vision, 70 (1), pp. 41-54; Fowler, J.H., Christakis, N.A., Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: Longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study (2008) BMJ; Gao, J., Liang, F., Fan, W., Sun, Y., Han, J., Graph-based Consensus Maximization among Multiple Supervised and Unsupervised Models (2009) NIPS; Gonzalez, J., Low, Y., Guestrin, C., Residual splash for optimally parallelizing belief propagation (2009) AISTAT; Haveliwala, T.H., Topic-sensitive pagerank: A context-sensitive ranking algorithm for web search (2003) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, pp. 784-796; Haveliwala, T., Kamvar, S., Jeh, G., (2003) An Analytical Comparison of Approaches to Personalizing Pagerank, , Technical report, Stanford University; Ji, M., Sun, Y., Danilevsky, M., Han, J., Gao, J., Graph regularized transductive classification on heterogeneous information networks (2010) LNCS, 6321, pp. 570-586. , Balcázar, J.L., Bonchi, F., Gionis, A., Sebag, M.

Our system combines structural and semantic information from a real corporate database of monitored activity on their users' computers to detect independently developed red team inserts of malicious insider activities. We have developed and applied multiple algorithms for anomaly detection based on suspected scenarios of malicious insider behavior, indicators of unusual activities, high-dimensional statistical patterns, temporal sequences, and normal graph evolution. Algorithms and representations for dynamic graph processing provide the ability to scale as needed for enterprise-level deployments on real-Time data streams. We have also developed a visual language for specifying combinations of features, baselines, peer groups, time periods, and algorithms to detect anomalies suggestive of instances of insider threat behavior. We defined over 100 data features in seven categories based on approximately 5.5 million actions per day from approximately 5,500 users. We have achieved area under the ROC curve values of up to 0.979 and lift values of 65 on the top 50 user-days identified on two months of real data.

In this paper we present a new approach to automatic grid segmentation of the raw fluorescence microarray images by Markov Random Field (MRF) techniques. The main objectives are applicability to various types of array designs and robustness to the typical problems encountered in microarray images, which are contaminations and weak signal. We briefly introduce microarray technology and give some background on MRFs. Our MRF model of microarray gridding is designed to integrate different application specific constraints and heuristic criteria into a robust and flexible segmentation algorithm. We show how to compute the model components efficiently and state our deterministic MRF energy minimization algorithm that was derived from the 'Highest Confidence First' algorithm by Chou et al. Since MRF segmentation may fail due to the properties of the data and the minimization algorithm, we use supplied or estimated print layouts to validate results. Finally we present results of tests on several series of microarray images from different sources, some of them test sets published with other microarray gridding software. Our MRF grid segmentation requires weaker assumptions about the array printing process than previously published methods and produces excellent results on many real datasets.

With such a device, two thresholds are introduced, each of which is associated with a terminal decision. The length of the detection process (integration time) is not fixed in advance of the experiment but is a random variable, depending on the progress of the test. An optimum form of such a test exists and is characterized by the fact that detection is performed on the average faster than with conventional; i. e., fixed sample size (optimum or non-optimum), devices. The sequential analysis developed by A. Wald is fully applied in this paper, but an important new feature is the treatment of correlated samples and its application to continuous sampling processes. In the introduction, the problem is presented within the framework of Wald's Statistical Decision Theory, and the optimum properties of sequential detectors are discussed accordingly. It is pointed out that a sequential detector is defined in terms of conditional probabilities and hence its operation is essentially independent of a priori information, although the average risk or cost of detection necessarily depends on the a priori signal data. The general theory is illustrated with some cases of special interest. The simplest example of detection involves independent, discrete observations; e. g., the case of a pulsed carrier in normal noise. Here the optimum detector still has the well-known log Io structure, but it is shown that the square law approximation for weak signals requires a bias correction due to the fourth order term. Coherent sequential detection of causal signals in normal noise provides another illustration of the theory. An interesting result is that the probabilities of error do not depend on the shape of the filter, provided the proper computer is used. The use of RC-Filtered noise illustrates the treatment of continuous detection processes. Finally, the reduction in minimum detectable signal level resulting from the use of a sequential detector is computed. A third example is the sequential detection of random signals in normal noise. It is shown that, although the optimum computer involves the knowledge of the inverted correlation matrix, the average length of the test does not. Hence a curious result is obtained that in this instance detection can be performed in an arbitrarily short time. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical necessity of truncating the detection process and exact expressions for the error probabilities of such truncated tests are derived and compared with Wald's original approximations. © 1955 IEEE.

During thymocyte development, cell fate is determined by signals originating from the αβ T-cell receptor. Low-affinity/avidity interactions between the T-cell receptor and peptide-MHC complexes direct differentiation to the single-positive stage (positive selection), whereas high-affinity/avidity interactions induce death by apoptosis (negative selection). Here we show that mice deficient in both calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)c2/c3 lack a population of preselection thymocytes with enhanced ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (Raf-MEK-ERK) pathway, and fail to undergo positive selection. This defect can be partially rescued with constitutively active Raf, indicating that calcineurin controls MAPK signalling. Analysis of mice deficient in both Bim (which is required for negative selection) and calcineurin revealed that calcineurin-induced ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) sensitization is required for differentiation in response to 'weak' positive selecting signals but not in response to 'strong' negative selecting signals (which normally induce apoptosis). These results indicate that early calcineurin/NFAT signalling produces a developmental period of ERK hypersensitivity, allowing very weak signals to induce positive selection. This mechanism might be generally useful in the discrimination of graded signals that induce different cell fates. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"BIM protein; calcineurin; mitogen activated protein kinase; Raf protein; T lymphocyte receptor; transcription factor NFAT; antibody; apoptosis; enzyme; peptide; rodent; signal; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell fate; cell maturation; controlled study; enzyme activation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; thymocyte; transgenic mouse; Mus",,"calcineurin, 137951-12-3; mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; transcription factor NFAT, 292890-46-1",,,"Palmer, E., Negative selection-clearing out the bad apples from the T-cell repertoire (2003) Nature Rev.

Previous proposals to realize MF, however, generally requires fine-tuning of parameters. Here we explore a platform which avoids the fine-tuning problem, namely a ferromagnetic chain deposited on the surface of a spin-orbit coupled s-wave superconductor. We show that it generically supports zero-energy topological MF excitations near the two ends of the chain with minimal fine-tuning. Depending on the strength of the ferromagnetic moment in the chain, the number of MFs at each end, n, can be either one or two, and should be revealed by a robust zero-bias peak (ZBP) of height 2 ne 2/h in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements which would show strong (weak) signals at the ends (middle) of the chain.

Yet, this narrow concentration of focus risks overlooking issues, events and transformations occurring at the periphery of corporate awareness that may threaten the survival of the organisation or provide opportunities for expansion. Being able to take in peripheral vision may therefore be crucial to an organisation's wellbeing. In this paper, we discuss how teams may play a crucial role in improving peripheral vision and awareness through their function and orientation. We identify a number of different functions of teams and develop a typology that shows how different types of teams orientate themselves in dealing with focal and peripheral issues. In particular we examine the cases of teams that are most orientated toward the periphery: minimally-structured and immersion teams, and show how each employs specific practices - namely zooming, improvisation, bricolage, scenario thinking, wild cards and weak signals - to sharpen peripheral vision and awareness. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Rather, at least partially, such learning is likely to occur in the course of action. The article also proposes that external pressure can set motion, but it alone does not lead to an environmental paradigm shift. In order to undergo such a shift, organizations will have to learn a meaning of their own to support new, more environmentally sound forms of activity. The present study examines empirically how two companies have learnt to incorporate environmental considerations into their managerial paradigms. It adopts a perspective according to which learning is portrayed as a process in which changes are brought about in the collective beliefs that the organization members hold about the relationship of their business to the natural environment (i.e. environmental management paradigm). Applying the grounded theory approach, the article identifies phases of environmental learning starting from the recognition or rejection of weak signals in 'pockets' of the organization, continuing through the gaining of new knowledge and experience towards 'competition' between old and new assumptions about the business-environment relationship, and finally proceeding to potential frame-break.",,,,,,,"Barrett, S., Murphy, D., The implications of the corporate environmental policy process for human resources management (1995) Greener Management International, 10, pp. 49-68; Bartunek, J., Changing interpretative schemes and organizational restructuring: The example of a religious order (1984) Administrative Science Quarterly, 29 (3), pp. 355-372; Bartunek, J., The dynamics of personal and organizational refraining (1988) Paradox and Transformation: Towards a Theory of Change in Organization and Management, pp. 137-162. , Quinn, R. and Cameron, K.

However, these services are often not effective when devices are in indoor environments. This paper presents an indoor room-level Bluetooth-based localization system. Fixed stations distributed throughout the environment get the RSSI from user devices. With these data, we compute the distance between the device and the stations, based on the signal propagation. In this paper, we propose a room localization method, based on a voting scheme, that eliminates cells close to a base station detecting devices with a weak signal.

Among numerous proposals, Wifi fingerprint-based localization is one of the most promising approach, since most buildings are nowadays equipped with Wifi access points for wireless network coverage. Due to the nature of Wifi access points in which any user can deploy and manage their own, fingerprints from some access points lead to estimation errors. Location estimation algorithms should consider these factors and be able to locate users with low error distance. Finding the nearest neighbor using Euclidean distance in signal space is most widely used method in estimating location. However, this paper shows that Euclidean distance is prone to error when unstable access points are present. Also, Euclidean distance does not differentiate strong signals and weak signals, which can also mislead location estimation. We propose a different way to determine the nearest neighbor, which penalizes signals from unstable access points, and signifies strong signals compared to weak signals. Experiments with real measurements show that the proposed algorithm reduces mean error distance by 57% and 90-percentile error distance by 64% compared to the Euclidean distance method.","Indoor localization; location estimation; Wifi fingerprint",,,,,,"Bahl, P., Padmanabhan, V.N., RADAR: An in-building RF-based user location and tracking system (2000) Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 775-784; Youssef, M., Agrawala, A., The Horus location determination system (2008) Springer Wireless Networks; King, T., Kopf, S., Haenselmann, T., Lubberger, C., Effelsberg, W., COMPASS: A probabilistic indoor positioning system based on 802.11 and Digital Compasses (2006) Proceedings of WINTECH; Want, R., Hopper, A., Falcao, V., Gibbsons, J., The Active Badge Location System (1992) ACM Transactions on Information Systems, pp. 91-102; Jones, W., Hopper, A., A New Location Technique for the Active Office (1997) IEEE Personal Communications, 4 (5), pp. 42-44; Chung, J., Donahoe, M., Schmandt, C., Kim, I., Indoor Location Sensing using Geo-Magnetism (2011) Proceedings of ACM MobiSys; Laoudias, C., Michaelides, M.P., Panayiotou, C.G., Fault Detection and Mitigation in WLAN RSS Fingerprint-based Positioning (2011) Proceedings of Int.

We argue that recent futures studies have essentially deepened the analysis of this concept, which originally lacked an accurate definition. Placing weak signals in the general context of futures research has provided the concept with a theoretical point of attachment and linked it with other futures concepts - such as strong signals and trends. Recent studies have also increased the applicability of the concept of weak signals, specifying ways in which signals can be identified, collected and interpreted. Consequently, a number of empirical examples of the analysis of weak signals are nowadays available. In the present paper, we summarize and evaluate both theoretical contributions and managerial implications of these new approaches. While emphasizing the advancements of research, we also want to point out that Ansoff not only was a pioneer in the field, but developed many ideas that are still applicable today. We conclude our paper by suggesting directions for the further development of weak signals research. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"conceptual framework; research; signal",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Californian Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice-Hall International, London; Ansoff, H.I., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes-new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22, pp. 93-111; Coates, J.S., Boom time in forecasting (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 62, pp. 37-40; Irvine, J., Martin, B.R., (1989) Research Foresight.

The aim of such systems is to detect changes in an organizational environment ahead of time by scanning the environment for ""weak signals"", which come in the form of trends. Design/methodology/approach - The questions that arise, particularly because the concept of SEWS is not entirely new, are: What are the pitfalls in implementing these systems, why do they occur, and how can they be overcome? To answer these questions, a single case study was conducted. Findings - The study suggests that the failure of SEWS is due mainly to a lack of participation of potential future users in the implementation phase, a lack of joint understanding of the nature of trends, differing and unrevealed requirements of trends by various interested parties, a broad misconception of the ""weak signals"" concept and trends, an excessively heavy reliance on alleged ""hard data"", a lack of interaction among users, and finally a ""missing link"" to the strategic functions in an organization. Research limitations/implications - The results of the study are limited due to the fact that they are derived from a single case study. Originality/value - The identification of pitfalls contributes to the research on implementing SEWS and this can also be linked to ""strategic issue management"" and the foresight process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Germany; Organizational change; Organizational planning; Strategic management",,,,,,"Ackoff, R.L., (1981) Creating the Corporate Future, , John Wiley & Sons Philadelphia, PA; Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , The Macmillan Company New York, NY; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issue management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-48; Baisch, F., (2000) Implementierung von Früherkennungssystemen in Unternehmen, , Josef Eul Verlag Köln; De Geus, A., (1997) The Living Company, , Harvard Business School Boston, MA; Drucker, P.F., (1969) The Age of Discontinuity: Guidelines to Our Changing Society, , Heinemann London; Dutton, J.E., Ottensmeyer, E., Strategic issue management systems: Forms, function, and contexts (1987) Academy of Management Review, 12 (2), pp. 355-65; Dutton, J.E., Fahey, L., Narayanan, V.K., Toward understanding strategic issue diagnosis (1983) Strategic Management Journal, 4, pp. 307-23; Fahey, L., Randall, R.M., Integrating strategy and scenarios (1998) Learning from the Future: Competitive Foresight Scenarios, pp. 22-38. , Fahey, L.

Drawing from actor-network theory, non-human entities may ""translate"" new, unexpected stakeholders to support their aims. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a theoretical conceptual approach with three illustrative examples. Findings: The examples provided show that corporate crises result partly from previously unacknowledged non-human spheres of influence and cause corporations serious losses. Corporations that take a proactive stance and monitor the weak signals of change are able to improve their standing and maintain legitimacy. Research limitations/implications: The framework created requires more testing with different examples across contexts and cultures. Future studies should examine the process of translation more deeply and examine who can potentially be translated into a stakeholder. Practical implications: Corporate communication should play ""the devil's advocate"" on issues and analyze not only stakeholders, but also non-human entities that may be able to translate others into joining their cause. Originality/value: This paper broadens stakeholder theory to better describe the current corporate environment by highlighting the process of translation among stakeholders and non-human entities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Networking; Stakeholder analysis; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Ackerman, R.W., (1975) The Social Challenge to Business, , HBS Press, Cambridge, MA; Bornsen, S., Ostrom-Blonigen, J., Plowman, K., Stakeholder theory: Antidote to a drug company's market health?

Most often the wild card is defined as a surprising event that has significant consequences. In the literature the examples labelled as wild cards do not always meet this definition. I have divided changes into two categories according to the rapidity of the change taking place: wild cards and gradual changes. By looking at the examples of wild cards in the literature, I found that a large number of them are actually gradual changes. This paper also clarifies the difference between wild cards and weak signals, which are sometimes considered synonymous.

The radio maps consist of WiFi fingerprints collected at a predefined set of positions/places within a positioning area. Each fingerprint consists of the identification and radio signal level of the surrounding Access Points (APs). Due to the wide proliferation of WiFi networks, it is very common to observe 10 to 20 APs at a single position and more than 50 APs across a single building. However, in practical, not all of the detected APs are useful for the position estimation process. Some of them might have weak signals at certain positions or might have less significance for a position's fingerprint. Thus, those useless APs will add additional computational overheads during the position estimation, and consequently they will reduce the overall performance of the positioning engines. A similar phenomenon also occurs with some of the collected fingerprints. While it is widely accepted that the larger and more detailed the radio map is, the better is the accuracy of the positioning system, we found that some of the fingerprint samples on the radio maps do not contribute significantly to the estimation process. In this paper, we propose two methods for filtering the positioning radio maps: APs filtering and Fingerprints filtering. Then we report on the results of a set of experiments that have been done to evaluate the performance of a WiFipositioning radio map before and after applying the filtering approaches. The results show that there is possibility to simplify the radio maps of the positioning engines without significant degradation on the positioning precision and accuracy, and therefore to reduce the processing time for estimating the position of a tracked WiFi tag. This result has an important impact on increasing the number of tags a single instance of a WiFi positioning engine can handle at a time. © 2013 IEEE.","filtering positioning radio maps; positioning engine performance; WiFi indoor location","Engines; Computational overheads; Engine performance; Indoor locations; Indoor positioning; Indoor positioning systems; Position estimation; Positioning precision; Radio maps; Wi-Fi",,,,,"Bahl, P., Padmanabhan, V.N., RADAR: An in-building RF-based user location and tracking system (2000) Proc.

While providing a broad view and discussing a variety of contributions on this topic, the aim of this article is to offer a more constructivist approach to early detection studies than has been typically the case so far. The article starts by positioning the underlying problem of weak signals within the broader field of futures studies. The second section examines the Ansoffian tradition, first on the basis of Ansoff's own contributions, then through key enhancements offered by scholars working in the same perspective. The third section develops the arguments for a constructivist critique of the Ansoffian tradition as a way to renew and enrich scientific debate. The fourth and final section presents the main open issues where research, case studies, methods and applications still need to make significant progress in the vast domain of weak signal analysis and early detection.""

However, changes in population distribution, population composition, family structures and tourism preferences pose a reason to challenge the general assumption that second home tourism would continue unchanged in the future. This paper reviews representations of the future of second home tourism in the Finnish media and policy discourse. Mainstream trends and emerging weak signals are recognized and further analysed in reference to the international context. As a result of the analysis four distinctive themes related to the future of second home tourism are distinguished: dual dwelling, internationalization, alternative forms and regional differentiation. These themes suggest a change in the traditional Finnish second home culture, often portrayed as a personal and national utopia. With the exception of dual dwelling, all the themes have so far been overlooked in the official policy discourse. The paper addresses a new theme in Finnish as well as international second home literature as so far only little has been published on the long term future of second home tourism.","Media discourse; Policy discourse; Second home tourism; Trends; Weak signals","family structure; future prospect; globalization; mass media; mobility; policy strategy; population distribution; second home; signal; tourism; trend analysis; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",,,,,"Buller, H., Hoggart, K., The social integration of British home owners into French rural communities (1994) Journal of Rural Studies, 10 (2), pp. 197-210; Coppock, J.T., Second homes in perspective (1977) Second Homes: Curse or Blessing?, pp. 1-15. , Pergamon, Oxford; Dijst, M., Lanzendorf, M., Barendregt, A., Smit, L., Second homes in Germany and the Netherlands: Ownership and travel impact explained (2004) Tijdschrift Voor Economishce En Sociale Geografie, 96 (2), pp. 139-152; Duval, T.D., Mobile migrants: Travel to second homes (2004) Tourism, Mobility and Second Homes.

They span over long periods of time, use encrypted connections and mimic normal behaviors in order to evade detection based on traditional defensive solutions. We propose an innovative approach that is able to analyze efficiently high volumes of network traffic to reveal weak signals related to data exfiltrations and other suspect APT activities. The final result is a ranking of the most suspicious internal hosts; this rank allows security specialists to focus their analyses on a small set of hosts out of the thousands of machines that typically characterize large organizations. Experimental evaluations in a network environment consisting of about 10K hosts show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our proposal based on security analytics paves the way to novel forms of automatic defense aimed at early detection of APTs in large and continuously varying networked systems. © 2016","Advanced Persistent Threats; Data exfiltration; Security analytics; Traffic analysis","Advanced Persistent Threats; Data exfiltration; Experimental evaluation; Innovative approaches; Large organizations; Network environments; nocv1; Security Analytics; Traffic analysis; Internet",,,,,"Brewer, R., Advanced persistent threats: minimising the damage (2014) Netw.

Building on signaling theory, we develop and test a model of the incentive and sorting effects of pay secrecy - a pay communication policy that limits employees' access to pay-related information and discourages the discussion of pay issues - under varying pay-for-performance (PFP) system characteristics. Results of a multiround laboratory simulation largely support the proposed moderated-mediation model. They indicate that pay secrecy has an adverse impact on individual task performance that is mediated by PFP perceptions, amplified when pay determination criteria are relative (as opposed to absolute), and attenuated when performance assessment is objective (as opposed to subjective). Results also indicate that pay secrecy has a similar adverse effect on participant continuation intentions (mediated through PFP perceptions, amplified when pay determination criteria are relative, and attenuated when performance assessment is objective), particularly among high performers. These findings suggest that weak signals associated with a particular managerial practice may become salient when interpreted in the context of other practice-based signals and that, under such conditions, even weak signals may drive negative-oriented inferences, having important behavioral implications. © Academy of Management Journal.",,,,,,,"Adams, J.S., Inequity in social exchange (1965) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 2, pp. 267-299. , L.

As a form of foresight raw material, ""weak signals"" can be thought of as gross, unstructured, fragmented, incomplete and inadvertent environmental data that may be refined into valuable information regarding context and further be articulated into strategically actionable knowledge. As advanced indicators that precede significant discrete one-off events and/or novel developments in the rate and direction of trends, their analysis has the potential to facilitate the real-time alignment between organisational decision-making and changing external circumstances. These predictors of future change pose fundamental problems of identification and interpretation and represent a challenge to established mental models. Thus, the practical significance of weak signals is that they can be transformed into meaningful insight for policy action. Such a value, however, does not materialise automatically. Realising this potential requires a degree of tolerance and fluidity of the collective cognitive frameworks by which weak signals can be apprehended, assessed and acted upon. This paper aims at covering the scope of perceptions and actions typically involved in the tracing and tracking of this shaping process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"cognition; data interpretation; decision making; modeling; perception; prediction; signal processing",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Californian Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice-Hall International Inc., USA; Diamond, J., (2004) Collapse, , Penguin, New York; Diamond, J., (2004) Twilight at Easter, , www.nybooks.com, New York Review of Books, available at; Lakatos, I., (1978) The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Philosophical Papers, 1. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Tegamar, M., Many lives in many worlds (2007) Nature, 448 (5), pp. 23-24; Kuhn, T.S., (1970) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, , Chicago University Press, Chicago; Castells, M., Information technology and global capitalism (2000) Living in Global Capitalism, pp. 52-74. , On the Edge, Jonathan Cape, London, W.

Some of the most important events of the last 2 years, particularly the political upheavals in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, caught most observers off guard-even knowledgeable ones. In the oil industry, experts have sometimes been able to suggest, but rarely to predict, the key turning points in crude oil prices. Time after time, events that are considered improbable or even implausible occur. The future is too important to be ignored, notwithstanding this difficulty. The Shell approach to strategic planning is, instead of forecasts, to use scenarios, a set of 'stories' about alternative possible futures. These stories promote a discussion of possibilities other than the 'most likely' one and encourage the consideration of 'what if' questions. Although scenarios deal with the future, they are essentially a way of structuring the overwhelming, confusing information we have about the present. One of the important uses for this structure is to help us recognize more of what is going on around us, including the early, weak signals of change. Good scenarios are challenging, plausible and internally consistent. They also illuminate the uncertainties and issues that are critical for the future (in the case of this paper, for the future of the energy industry to the year 2010). Scenarios lead to better decisions if they improve our understanding of the world. This paper outlines two scenarios prepared in the Group Planning Coordination of Shell International Petroleum Company. Two notes are important. First, the author has summarized a much larger body of work to which approximately twenty members of Group Planning contributed, under the leadership of Kees van der Heijden. Second, this work was completed in the summer of 1989 and so, naturally, were we to re-formulate the scenarios now, our assessments in many areas would be very different. The value of this paper is therefore less in the content of the scenarios than in the particular approach to thinking about the future. © 1992.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00246301,,,,"English","Long Range Plann.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249008357

An intended solution to this problem is the electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), which stochastically amplifies the acquired signal to drown out the readout noise. Here, we develop the theory for calculating the Fisher information content of the amplified signal, which is modeled as the output of a branching process. Specifically, Fisher information expressions are obtained for a general and a geometric model of amplification, as well as for two approximations of the amplified signal. All expressions pertain to the important scenario of a Poisson-distributed initial signal, which is characteristic of physical processes such as photon detection. To facilitate the investigation of different data models, a ""noise coefficient"" is introduced which allows the analysis and comparison of Fisher information via a scalar quantity.We apply our results to the problem of estimating the location of a point source from its image, as observed through an optical microscope and detected by an EMCCD. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Branching process; Electron Multiplication; Fisher information; Quantum-limited imaging; Single molecule microscopy","Amplified signals; Branching process; Electron multiplication; Fisher information; Geometric models; High quantum efficiency; Imaging technology; Noise coefficient; Optical microscopes; Photon detection; Physical process; Point sources; Readout noise; Single-molecule microscopy; Weak signals; Probability distributions; Signal processing; Fisher information matrix",,,,,"Abramowitz, M., Stegun, I.A., (1965) Handbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables, , New York: Dover Publications; Andersson, S.B., Localization of a fluorescent source without numerical fitting (2008) Optics Express, 16, pp. 18714-18724; Athreya, K.B., Ney, P.E., (2004) Branching processes, , New York: Dover Publications; Basden, A.G., Haniff, C.A., Mackay, C.D., Photon counting strategies with low-light-level CCDs (2003) Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 345 (3), pp. 985-991. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.07020.x; Born, M., Wolf, E., (1999) Principles of optics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; DeSantis, M.C., DeCenzo, S.H., Li, J., Wang, Y.M., Precision analysis for standard deviation measurements of immobile single fluorescent molecule images (2010) Optics Express, 18, pp. 6563-6576; Grimmett, G.R., Stirzaker, D.R., (2001) Probability and random processes, , (3rd ed.).

We introduce a post-processing refinement algorithm, which makes use of a 3D map of the city buildings as well as captured signals from all traceable navigation satellites. This includes weak signals originating from satellites with no line of sight (NLOS) with the device. We also address the dual problem - computing a 3D map of the city buildings when the position of the device is given. This is achieved by storing LOS/NLOS rays to all navigation satellites sampled at multiple locations within a region of interest (ROI). These rays are then used to compute the 3D shapes of buildings in the ROI. A series of field experiments confirm that both algo- rithms are applicative.

Some have argued that NASA's failure to respond with appropriate intensity to the so-called foam strike that led to the accident was evidence of irresponsible or incompetent management. The authors' research, however, suggests that NASA was exhibiting a natural, albeit unfortunate, pattern of behavior common in many organizations. The foam strike is a prime example of what the authors call an ambiguous threat-a signal that may or may not portend future harm. Ambiguous threats differ from threats with obvious causes-say, a fire in the building-for which the response is clear. They also differ from unmistakable threats that may lack straightforward response paths (such as the frightening oxygen-tank explosion aboard Apollo 13). However, when the warning sign is ambiguous and the threat's potential effect is unclear, managers may choose to ignore or discount the risk. Such an approach can be catastrophic. Firms that do a good job of dealing with ambiguous threats do not improvise during a crisis; rather, they apply a rigorous set of detection and response capabilities that they have developed and practiced beforehand. In this article, the authors outline how to put such capabilities in place long before a crisis strikes. First, companies need to hone their teamwork and rapid problem-solving skills through practice. Second, they must learn to recognize weak signals, amplify the threat, and encourage employees to ask disconcerting ""what if"" questions in a safe environment Finally, they should explore possible responses to threats through quick, low-cost experimentation.",,"article; commercial phenomena; methodology; organization and management; risk assessment; United States; Commerce; Risk Assessment; United States",,,,,,"Roberto, M.A.; Department of Management, Bryant University, Smithfield, RI, United States; email: mroberto@bryant.edu",,,,,,,,00178012,,HABRA,"17131567","English","Harv.

Although trends are considered to be important drivers of environmental discontinuities which may lead to strategic surprises, there is no operationalization from a strategic point of view. In this paper we are going to conceptualize trends as (socio-cultural) innovations. This leads to important implications. If the nature of innovation is taken seriously, then strategic trend diagnosis has to deal with two different aspects, invention and diffusion. First, we are going to present a framework for identifying the invention aspect of a trend (i.e., "" the new"" ) which is based on the fact that "" the new"" results from a transgression of contextual boundaries. Second, we are going to operationalize the diffusion of "" the new"" as a threefold process of normalization - i.e., an unusual practice becomes social convention. Taken together, these two aspects provide a theoretical link between trends and market creation. In addition, by relating the above operationalizations to an entrepreneurial strategy-making framework, strategic issue diagnosis can be improved and more seamlessly linked to strategy formulation. © 2009.",,"conceptual framework; entrepreneur; future prospect; innovation; market development; organizational framework; planning theory; strategic approach; technology diffusion; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , The Macmillian Company, New York; Keegan, W.J., (1967), Scanning the International Business Environment, Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, Boston; Bright, J.R., Evaluating signals of technological change (1970) Harvard Business Review, 48, pp. 62-70; Bright, J.R., Forecasting by monitoring signals of technological change (1973) A Guide to Practical Technological Forecasting, pp. 238-256. , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, J.R.

The philosophy of FSSF is based on the principles of environmental scanning and pattern management, which state that if there is a grand transformation process on the way or if there is a new emerging pattern or phenomenon, such a process will certainly be reflected in many different ways. Therefore, in this philosophy, futures knowledge is believed to be fragmented between various simultaneous and overlapping sources. Here, a researcher's task is to carry out a sufficient environmental scanning process and to cluster and sense how to create the emerging future through a pattern management process where FSSF plays a role as the first start-up tool. Alternatively, FSSF can also be used as a general knowledge management and sense-making tool for any kind of analyses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this article is to discuss the usefulness of developing foresight in a business wargame. Wargaming, a role-playing simulation of a dynamic situation, has been used mainly by the military, but more recently, it has also been used in the context of competitive intelligence and strategy-testing in organisations. A business wargame typically evolves several years into the future, allowing the participants to 'experience' future dynamics in the organisational environment and, consequently, to develop foresight. This article argues that, because of its participative and dynamic nature, business wargaming can overcome cognitive barriers, challenge mental models, detect weak signals of change in an organisational environment, re-direct attention in an organisation, and assist an organisation in developing foresight.","Business wargaming; Foresight; Scenario planning; Weak signals","business; computer simulation; future prospect; organizational framework; signal",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York; Andlinger, G.R., Looking around: What can business games do?

These Descriptors are visible in the form of weak signals. The authors link the impact of these Descriptors on the long-range planning system of a company through a set of Environmental Indicators and their Influence Diagrams. The process of monitoring is carried out by a group of managers who act as Environmental Radars. The role of Radars is to monitor the Descriptors, intercept and amplify the weak signals using an Environmental Data Base and generate the Environmental Scenarios.

A standard procedure is to reduce the received data by sampling and then hard limiting. Hard limiting is shown to introduce an inherent loss in input signal power of 1.96 dB when the input data is a sequence of independent samples from a stationary Gaussian process. However, when the stationary and/or Gaussian assumptions are violated, the relative efficiencies of the PCA detectors can greatly improve. When the input samples are dependent, it is necessary to assume Gaussian inputs in order to analyze the PCA detectors. However, these devices are still unaffected by a nonstationary noise level that is slowly varying relative to the inverse bandwidth of the pre-filter. Furthermore, the loss due to clipping is considerably reduced as the sample dependence (i.e., sampling rate) increases. For rapid sampling rates, the spectral shapes of the inputs must be known accurately in order to fix the false-alarm rate at some preassigned value. © 1966, IEEE.

Transporting these signals without disturbance is customarily done by isolating the quantum channel from any noise sources using a dedicated physical channel. However, to really profit from this technology, a full integration with conventional network technologies would be highly desirable. Trying to use single photon signals with others that carry an average power many orders of magnitude bigger while sharing as much infrastructure with a conventional network as possible brings obvious problems. The purpose of the present paper is to report our efforts in researching the limits of the integration of QKD in modern optical networks scenarios. We have built a full metropolitan area network testbed comprising a backbone and an access network. The emphasis is put in using as much as possible the same industrial grade technology that is actually used in already installed networks, in order to understand the throughput, limits and cost of deploying QKD in a real network. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2010.","Passive optical networks; Quantum key distribution","Access network; Average power; Dedicated physical channels; Full integration; Network technologies; Noise source; Optical telecommunication; Orders of magnitude; Passive Optical Networks; Quantum channel; Quantum key distribution; Real networks; Single photon signals; Weak signals; Fiber optic networks; Optical communication; Profitability; Quantum chemistry; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Telecommunication networks; Quantum communication",,,,,"Poppe, A., Peev, M., Maurhart, O., Outline of the SECOQC Quantum-Key-Distribution Network (2008) Int.

Foresight has made a transition from thematic papers and policy briefs to a complex set of methods integrated in the framework of S&T and innovation policy making. Foresight also addresses broad social and economic issues along with conventional S&T problems. It focuses often on interdisciplinary fields and cross-sector problems. It has witnessed the introduction of such new methods as weak signals and wild cards, and it has benefitted from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Russian S&T foresight follows global trends. It has given support for revisions of the national S&T priorities and critical technologies. In 2007-2010, two cycles of the National S&T Foresight (initiated by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation) were completed. They resulted in the creation of frameworks and expert networks for future studies. Foresight culture has been finding deeper roots in Russia. The paper addresses mainly the key features of the third (ongoing) cycle of the national S&T Foresight (2011) against the background of the first two cycles and the international trends. This cycle represents a wider coverage of issues (macroeconomic scenarios, trends in basic research, S&T resources, future dem and for skills, and global drivers of S&T developments); more complicated methodologies (bibliometric analysis, expert panels, surveys, roadmapping, and quantitative models); and a combination of ""market pull"" and ""technology push"" approaches toward estimating future developments. This cycle is building a wider network of experts at new Foresight centres at various Russian research universities. It concludes with a discussion of some barriers still to be overcome in Foresight studies: integration of sectoral visions, deeper analyses of some scientific disciplines, stronger integration into policy making, and spreading among business and research communities.","Critical technologies; Decision-making; Foresight; Long-term forecasting; National innovation system; Roadmapping; Russian long-term S&T foresight; S&T priorities",,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Grand challenges - A new framework for foresight evaluation (2011) Paper Presented at the EU-SPRI Conference, , 20-22 September.

However, one of the challenges in microseismic monitoring is that those seismic signals generated from micro seismicity have extremely low amplitude. We develop a methodology to unveil the signals that are smeared in the strong ambient noise and thus facilitate a more accurate arrival-Time picking that will ultimately improve the localization accuracy. In the proposed technique, we decompose the recorded data into several morphological multi-scale components. In order to unveil weak signal, we propose an orthogonalization operator which acts as a time-varying weighting in the morphological reconstruction. The orthogonalization operator is obtained using an inversion process. This orthogonalized morphological reconstruction can be interpreted as a projection of the higher-dimensional vector. We first test the proposed technique using a synthetic dataset. Then the proposed technique is applied to a field dataset recorded in a project in China, in which the signals induced from hydraulic fracturing are recorded by twelve three-component (3-C) geophones in a monitoring well. The result demonstrates that the orthogonalized morphological reconstruction can make the extremely weak microseismic signals detectable. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"China; decomposition; fracking; human;

The following theories and associated theoretical frameworks are discussed in the article: (1) Environmental Scanning Model, (2) Nonaka's Knowledge Management Theory, (3) Gammelgaard's and Ritter's Knowledge Retrieval Matrix, (4) Boisot's Information Space Model and (5) Vejlgaard's Diamond Shaped Trend Model. These various and nevertheless complementary perspectives are important for the further development of weak signal analysis, knowledge management theory and knowledge management practices in modern organisations as well as for anticipation and decision-making in policy-making arenas. There are still many theoretical and empirical challenges in these fields of scientific knowledge. A general conclusion is that all these frameworks provide interesting new perspectives for modern futures studies as such. Another conclusion is that there are various knowledge management (KM) and scanning frameworks available for implementing weak signal analysis. However, this paper, its observations and conclusions also imply that a more generalised approach to weak signal analysis needs to be developed and that modern KM theories should be used when developing new futures studies/foresight methodologies. According to the theoretical guidelines presented in this article, it is possible to make the suggestion that it would be wise to integrate the latest developments in weak signal analysis into knowledge management theory and vice versa. © 2011.",,"decision making; knowledge; management; policy making; signal processing; theoretical study",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic Response in Turbulent Environments (1982), Working Paper No. 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, August; Ansoff, I.H., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, p. 510. , Prentice/Hall International; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Webb, J.R., An evaluation of Igor Ansoff's theory of weak signal management by means of an investigation and forecast of future developments in the ophthalmic laser environment (1987), Doctoral thesis, University of Strathclyde; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part I: Introduction (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrintro.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part II: Information Theory (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/infotheory.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part IV: Evolution and Growth of the Weak Signal to Maturity (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrmatur.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Part V: A Process Model for Weak Signal Research (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrprocm.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Presentation in Actes de la 3e Conferénce de l'AIS Amérique (Association for Information Systems); Harris, D.D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals: detecting the next big thing (2002) The Futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-29; Day, G., Schoemaker, P., Scanning the periphery (2005) Harvard Business Review, pp. 135-148. , November; Mendonça, S.S., e Cunha, M.P., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., Wild cards, weak signals and organizational improvisation (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 201-218; Mannermaa, M., Toolbox ja heikot signaalit (1999) Futura, 13 (2), pp. 32-37; Mannermaa, M., A Strong Future from Weak Signals (2004) Heikoista signaaleista vahva tulevaisuus, , WSOY, Porvoo; Hiltunen, E., Heikot signaalit - teoriakatsaus (2000) Futura, 14 (2), pp. 72-77; Hiltunen, E., Heikkojen signaalien käyttö yrityksissä (2001) Futura, 15 (1), pp. 45-50; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Kuusi, O., Hiltunen, E., Linturi, H., Heikot tulevaisuussignaalit - Delfoi tutkimus (2000) Futura, 14 (2), pp. 78-92; Nikander, I.O., Early warnings - a phenomenon in project management (2002), Dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Science in Technology, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Moijanen, M., Heikot signaalit tulevaisuuden tutkimuksessa (2003) Futura, 17 (4), pp. 38-60; Ilmola, L., Kuusi, O., Filters of weak signals hinder foresight: monitoring weak signals efficiently in corporate decision-making (2006) Futures, 38 (8), pp. 908-924; Uskali, T., Paying attention to weak signals - the key concept for innovation journalism (2005) Innovation Journalism, 2 (4), pp. 33-49; Brummer, V., Innovaatioaihioiden verkkopohjainen ideointi ja monikriteerinen seulonta (Internet based generation and multicriteria screening of innovation ideas) (2005), http://www.sal.hut.fi/Publications/pdffiles/TBRU05.pdf, MSc Thesis (Engineering), Department of Physics and Mathematics, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Kuosa, T., Heikko signaali vai merkityksetön kohina: Pattern management - ontologisesti uusi lähestymistapa heikkojen signaalien tarkasteluun ja tulkintaan (2005) Futura, 19 (4), pp. 115-120; e Cunha, M.P., Chia, R., Using teams to avoid peripheral blindness (2007) Long Range Planning, 40 (6), pp. 559-573; Kuosa, T., Futures signals sense-making framework (FSSF): a start-up tool to analyse and categorise weak signals, wild cards, drivers, trends and other types of information (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 42-48; Mendonca, S., Cunha, M.P.E., Ruff, F., Kaivo-oja, J., Venturing into the wilderness: preparing for wild cards in the civil aircraft and asset-management industries.

To describe partially known noise distribution densities, a distribution class characterized by the upper-bounds upon a noise variance and a density dispersion in the central part is used. The results on the minimax variance estimation in the Huber sense are applied to the problem of asymptotically minimax detection of a weak signal. The least favorable density minimizing Fisher information over this class is called the Weber-Hermite density and it has the Gaussian and Laplace densities as limiting cases. The subsequent minimax detector has the following form: i) with relatively small variances, it is the minimum L 2 -norm distance rule; ii) with relatively large variances, it is the L 1 -norm distance rule; iii) it is a compromise between these extremes with relatively moderate variances. It is shown that the proposed minimax detector is robust and close to Huber's for heavy-tailed distributions and more efficient than Huber's for short-tailed ones both in asymptotics and on finite samples. © 2006 IEEE.","Huber's M-estimators; Least favorable distributions; Non-gaussian noise; Robust minimum distance detection","Asymptotic analysis; Fisher information matrix; Gaussian noise (electronic); Laplace transforms; Robustness (control systems); Signal detection; Telecommunication systems; Huber's M estimators; Least favorable distributions; Non gaussian noise; Robust minimum distance detection; Spurious signal noise",,,,,"Abramowitz, M., Stegun, I., (1972) Handbook of Mathematical Functions, , New York: Dover; Adler, R.J., Feldman, R.E., Taqqu, M.S., (1997) A Practical Guide to Heavy Tails: Statistical Techniques for Analyzing Heavy Tailed Distributions, , Basel, Switzerland: Birkhauser; Delic, H., Hocanin, A., Robust detection in DS-CDMA (2002) IEEE Trans.

The approach utilizes the temporal and spatial locality to extract the behavior features of the proxy-to-server traffic, which makes the scheme independent of the traffic intensity and frequently varying Web contents. A nonlinear mapping function is introduced to protect weak signals from the interference of infrequent large values. Then, a new hidden semi-Markov model parameterized by Gaussian-mixture and Gamma distributions is proposed to describe the time-varying traffic behavior of Web proxies. The new method reduces the number of parameters to be estimated, and can characterize the dynamic evolution of the proxy-to-server traffic rather than the static statistics. Two diagnosis approaches at different scales are introduced to meet the requirement of both fine-grained and coarse-grained detection. Soft control is a novel attack response method proposed in this work. It converts a suspicious traffic into a relatively normal one by behavior reshaping rather than rudely discarding. This measure can protect the quality of services of legitimate users. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2012 IEEE.","attack detection; attack response; distributed denial of service attack; Traffic analysis; traffic modeling","Attack detection; attack response; Distributed denial of service attack; Traffic analysis; Traffic modeling; HTTP; Internet service providers",,,,,"Triukose, S., Al-Qudah, Z., Rabinovich, M., Content delivery networks: Protection or threat?

This attempt takes place within the effort that futures studies have deployed to cope with the need to be 'early' in change processes, and is intended to improve firms' preparedness regarding uncertainties, threats and opportunities. The weak signal notion is one of the metaphors coined to accomplish that, thanks to the seminal role played by Igor Ansoff in the 1970s and 1980s, and the inputs of more recent continuators who have shaped a wide methodological environment. After over 20 years of weak signal exploration, some pending issues suggest the need to re-open some basic hypotheses as well as the use of a wide-angle lens to review the Ansoff legacy and its relevance for management and decision-making. The concepts of framing and meta-framing are the means that will allow us to do this by adding a more reflexive dimension to weak signal analysis, taking account of analysts' and commissioning organisations' own biases, and enhancing firms' robustness against possibly disruptive futures. Pragmatic managerial orientations of how to make use of methodological blends involving reflexive steps will be outlined, also suggesting diverse tracks for further research on weak signal theories and their contributions to both futures studies and strategic management.","Constructivism; Framing; Paradigmatic biases; Reflexivity; Weak signal","decision making; future prospect; hypothesis testing; management practice; signal; strategic approach; theoretical study; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Adam, B., Has the future already happened?

It has been observed that this ability improves in the presence of binaural cues. In this paper, we explore a technique for speech segregation based on sound localization cues. The auditory masking phenomenon motivates an ""ideal"" binary mask in which time-frequency regions that correspond to the weak signal are canceled. In our model we estimate this binary mask by observing that systematic changes of the interaural time differences and intensity differences occur as the energy ratio of the original signals is modified. The performance of our model is comparable with results obtained using the ideal binary mask and it shows a large improvement over existing pitch-based algorithms.",,"Acoustic signal processing; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Signal to noise ratio; Statistical methods; Time domain analysis; Interaural intensity differences; Interaural time differences; Sound localization; Speech segregation; Speech intelligibility",,,,,"Bregman, A.S., (1990) Auditory Scene Analysis, , Cambridge, MA: MIT press; Blauert, J., (1997) Spatial Hearing - The Psychophysics of Human Sound Localization, , Cambridge, MA: MIT press; Wang, D.L., Brown, G.J., Separation of speech from interfering sounds based on oscillatory correlation (1999) IEEE Trans.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging at macroscopic scales has been demonstrated by scanning a visible surface with a pulsed laser and a time-resolved detector. Whereas light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems use such measurements to recover the shape of visible objects from direct reflections, NLOS imaging reconstructs the shape and albedo of hidden objects from multiply scattered light. Despite recent advances, NLOS imaging has remained impractical owing to the prohibitive memory and processing requirements of existing reconstruction algorithms, and the extremely weak signal of multiply scattered light. Here we show that a confocal scanning procedure can address these challenges by facilitating the derivation of the light-cone transform to solve the NLOS reconstruction problem. This method requires much smaller computational and memory resources than previous reconstruction methods do and images hidden objects at unprecedented resolution. Confocal scanning also provides a sizeable increase in signal and range when imaging retroreflective objects. We quantify the resolution bounds of NLOS imaging, demonstrate its potential for real-time tracking and derive efficient algorithms that incorporate image priors and a physically accurate noise model. Additionally, we describe successful outdoor experiments of NLOS imaging under indirect sunlight. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Space users have also seen remarkable achievements, where GPS signal reception has been confirmed and reported in GEO orbits [3] and seen as enablers for increased spacecraft autonomy in GEO orbits [4]. The study of weak GNSS signal reception techniques for lunar missions appears as a logical sequential step which is further supported by the growing international efforts for lunar exploration, which typically involves radiometric range and Doppler measurements from the Earth to perform orbit determination. In the frame of an ongoing ESA study, the Lunar GNSS project is studying the main challenges of a GNSS receiver in different phases of a mission to the Moon including Moon Transfer Orbit, Low Lunar Orbit and Descent. The study analyses expected signal strengths, DOP and number of visible satellites for selected trajectories and space volumes. Factors such as GNSS antenna radiation patterns (transmitter and receiver), frequency, constellations, spacecraft attitude, signal integration times and data assistance are discussed. Requirements for the Lunar Lander mission based on conventional radiometric measurements are presented. An overview of high sensitivity techniques which take benefit of Galileo signals and modernized GPS to cope with the challenges is provided and a description of an orbital filter complementing GNSS measurements in closely-coupled fashion is presented. The paper also describes a dedicated test platform which allows demonstrating the main functional and performance capabilities for weak signal navigation. A first batch of simulation results for selected trajectories of the Lunar Lander mission are presented, highlighting the preliminary achievable navigation performance throughout the trajectories.",,"Antenna radiation; Lunar missions; Mobile devices; Navigation; Orbits; Radiometry; Satellites; Signal receivers; High sensitivity technique; In-door navigations; Lunar lander mission; Navigation performance; Orbit determination; Performance capability; Radiometric measurements; Transmitter and receiver; Global positioning system",,,,,"Mulassano, P., Dovis, F., Assisted global navigation satellite systems: An enabling technology for high demanding location-based services (2011) Location-Based Services Handbook, pp. 279-298. , Ahson S.

Weak signals are signs anticipating or pointing to possibly emerging new issues. Weak signals can be perceived through all five human senses: they can be seen, heard, smelled, felt or even tasted. Visual weak signals are weak signals shown in a visual form. They can be represented as images: photos, paintings, drawings, video clips, etc. [2]. The method used by the Futures Window is to display weak signals in a visual form as a slide show on a large screen with the aim of encouraging people to anticipate and innovate futures. The Futures Window could be a central tool to be used in Creative Foresight Spaces (CFS). 11The idea for the concept of Creative Foresight Space originated during two research projects ""Technology Futures Forum"" and ""SOMED"" (Social media at the crossroads of physical, virtual and digital worlds), initiated by Dr. Sirkka Heinonen, and first described in the conference presentation by Toni Ahlqvist, Minna Halonen and Sirkka Heinonen ""Social Media Applications for Innovative Working Environments"" 9th International Conference of Finland Futures Research Centre and Finland Futures Academy ""Culture and Innovation - The search for Creative Power in Economics and Societies"".

The concept of CFS is offered as one way of responding to the growing demand for innovation in corporations and work organisations. The FW method was tested at VTT Technical Research Centre (http://www.vtt.fi/) in Finland in two pilots in 2006-2007. A survey was conducted to gather employee's opinions of the FW experiments. The results show that employees considered the FW positively and they confirmed that it stimulated futures thinking. The results of this study are encouraging for further developing the Futures Window as a key element of CFS.

This finding is consistent with the services of financial analysts becoming more valuable and in greater demand as accruals provide weaker signals about future cash flows. Further, it is accruals quality associated with innate uncertainty in the firm's operating environment that attracts analysts even after controlling for operating uncertainty associated with cash flow and stock return volatility. This suggests that low quality accruals provide an opportunity for analysts to benefit from generating private information. Consistent with analysts providing compensating information, we find that forecasts for firms with lower accruals quality contain more private information. © 2011.","Accruals quality; Analyst coverage; Information asymmetry; Operating uncertainty; Private information",,,,,,"Ahn, H., Cai, J., Hamao, Y., Ho, R.Y.K., Adverse selection, brokerage coverage, and trading activity on the tokyo stock exchange (2005) Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, pp. 1483-1508; Alford, A., Berger, P., A simultaneous equations analysis of forecast accuracy, analyst following, and trading volume (1999) Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance, 14, pp. 219-240. , Summer; Antia, M., Pantzalis, C., Security analyst incentives and quality of analyst generated information (2006) Journal of Investing, 15, pp. 50-55; Barron, O.E., Byard, D., Kile, C., Riedl, E.J., High-technology intangibles and analysts' forecasts (2002) Journal of Accounting Research, 40, pp. 289-312; Barron, O.E., Harris, D.G., Stanford, M., Evidence that investors trade on private event-period information around earnings announcements (2005) The Accounting Review, 80, pp. 403-421; Barron, O.E., Kim, O., Lim, S.C., Stevens, D.E., Using analysts' forecasts to measure properties of analysts' information environment (1998) The Accounting Review, 73, pp. 421-433; Barth, M.E., Kasznik, R., McNichols, M.F., Analyst coverage and intangible assets (2001) Journal of Accounting Research, 39, pp. 1-34; Bhattacharya, N., Desai, H., Venkataraman, K., Earnings quality and information asymmetry: evidence from trading costs.

As an application, we consider the contraband detection in which both the source mixing matrix Wij(for the i-th object and the j-th channel) and Vj, the sources in question, are unknown due to uncooperative subjects. For weak signals, we can assume a linear mixing model Uj/= Σj=i/N/W(/ij)Vi of which the total probability of the set of unknowns Vjmust be added up to one Σ/i+1 N/Vj/=1. We postulate that for i-1 each case of real positive unknowns (W ijand V) there exists a maximum entropy E(Vj) constrained with the measurements in terms of Lagrangian multiplies λ. The entropy function becomes a Hopfield-like energy function when we implement E(V j) in terms of neurons. Then both the Lagrangian variational calculus and the Hopfield neural network are used to estimate both unknowns as follows: (i) Given measurement {Ui}, we make an initial guess of a set of λ/iand Wijwhich allow us to compute by definition λ/0and sources Vjand then we use the Lagrangian variational calculus (derived at the extremum part/E/ part/Vj=0) to improve the set of /spl lambda/ithrough their changes /spl Delta//spl λ/ithat minimize the departures from the measurements (ii) alternatively, the gradient descent toward the extremum via Hopfield energy landscape (/spl part/U1//spl part/t=-/spl part/E//spl part/Vi) determines the mixing weight matrix Wij. We refer to the double recursions methodology (i)-(ii) as the Lagrangian-Hopfield neural network for solving the double unknowns. Three identical simulations are let to discover 3, 2, and 4 unknown sources given three different initial values.

The noise field is assumed to be spatially uncorrelated and to have different unknown powers in each array sensor. The derivation of the AML estimator is carried out under the assumptions of a large number of samples and a weak signal. The variance of the introduced AML estimator is compared with the exact Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of this estimation problem. It is shown analytically that the variance of the estimation errors and the corresponding CRB coincide asymptotically in the majority of practically important cases. The analogy between the presented AML estimator and the well-known ML estimator, which is derived under equal noise variance assumption (this estimator is based on the matched processing and is usually termed as conventional beamformer), is considered. This analogy enables straightforward extension of the AML estimator to the case of well-separated weak multiple sources with unknown locations and consideration of it as a variant of conventional beamformer for unknown noise field scenarios. The analytical results are verified by computer simulations.",,"Antennas; Arrays; Computer simulation; Matrix algebra; Parameter estimation; Sensors; Spurious signal noise; Statistical methods; Beamformer; Covariance matrix; Cramer-Rao bound; Matched processing; Maximum likelihood estimation; Sensor array; Signal power; Signal theory",,,,,,"Gershman, A.B.; Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany",,,"IEE, Stevenage, United Kingdom",,,,,13502395,,IRSNE,,"English","IEE Proc Radar Sonar Navig",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029389916

This paper describes the results from the operation of the SGR-GEO experiment on the GIOVE-A Galileo demonstrator mission following the satellite's retirement in 2012 from signal transmissions. It describes the progress from early to later experiments and the improvements gained after refinement of the application software. The SGR-GEO has been using weak signal tracking techniques to track not only main lobe signals of the GPS transmit antennas but also the 1st and 2 nd sidelobes. Once acquired, up to 11 GPS satellites have been tracked simultaneously and a coverage of 75% position fix has been demonstrated, with accuracies believed better than 100 metres. The measurements of the SNR could be used for a preliminary reconstruction of the GPS satellite sidelobes.

Both synthetic and experimental ultrasonic A-scans have been used. Synthetic ultrasonic traces have been generated using an approximate speckle model which includes frequency dependent attenuation and scattering. Ultrasonic signals acquired from a test block made of austenitic steel have also been denoised. Results obtained using a Cycle-Spinning (CS) implementation of the stationary wavelet transform are compared with those obtained using with the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), using soft thresholding and two decomposition level dependent threshold selection rules (Universal and SURE). It is shown that both DWT and CS denoising procedures yield very bad results when using Universal thresholds.

Design/methodology/approach - Early detection and rapid action with respect to developments in the operating environment is a prerequisite for successful marketing planning. Accordingly, this paper proposes a three-stage process for overcoming practical obstacles to the detection and use of weak signals from the operating environment, in particular how to identify relevant and useful documents in harsh information environments such as the internet. Its functionality is demonstrated by means of a human-machine experiment. Findings - A framework based on information foraging theory is well suited to the task of determining the relevance of documents and facilitates the automation of information search processes. A prototype environmental scanning system of this type outperformed human experts in a typical scanning task. Research limitations/implications - Embedding the detection of weak signals in a formal process permits intelligence gatherers to step beyond anecdotal evidence, and complements the current literature on weak signal detection with formal and systematic procedural guidelines. Practical implications - The presented methodology facilitates both the selection and the structuring of information sources. This unburdens the managers and leaves time for important tasks such as the development of concrete marketing plans reacting to detected developments. Originality/value - The paper provides a comprehensive framework for web-based weak signal detection in business environments, and can be used as a string point for the development of practicable environmental scanning systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business environment;

The approach is based on a laminar domain structure and a hierarchical homogenization procedure, which considers grains as spherical inclusions within a homogenized effective medium. The model predicts the extrinsic effects of mobile domain walls, hysteresis at large fields, and ferroelectric fatigue by unipolar cycling. Additionally, internal fields can be estimated. As an example, numerical results and available experimental data for barium titanate ceramics are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive search, big data-based mate recommendations, and varying levels of anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to check out a potential mate's profile while not leaving any visible online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates ""weak signals"" of interest for their potential mates that may play an important role in establishing successful communication. We run a randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited, in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated by a corresponding increase in quality of matches.

SR has been studied extensively in the area of weak signal detection and baseband binary PAM signals transmission. In this paper, the watermark is viewed as weak binary signals, and the median-frequency DCT components of all the 8*8 image blocks are randomly permuted to be an approximate White Gaussian Noise (WGN). When the watermark signals which are corrupted by the noise go through the well tuned nonlinear system, SR occurs and the output Signal Noise Ratio is amplified. Then the watermark signals are recovered by judging whether the sum of the stable points is positive or not. The simulation has shown that the proposed watermarking scheme has the advantage of robustness, invisibility, and practicability. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Computer simulation; Discrete cosine transforms; Robustness (control systems); Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Stochastic models; Median-frequency components; Signal transmissions; Stochastic resonance (SR); Watermark signals; Digital watermarking",,,,,"Benzi, R., Sutera, A., Vulpiani, A., The mechanism of stochastic resonance (1981) J.

In the literature, numerous designs for ultra-wideband antennas intended for biological sensing applications have been reported [1-4]. When deploying sensors in prototype systems, an additional level of complexity arises when the system needs to adapt to the human body, which varies in size and shape from patient-to-patient [5]. At the University of Calgary we have developed two different systems targeted to breast imaging using ultra-wideband (UWB) signals [6,7].

The chamber is mounted onto a 5-circle surface diffractometer and contains a large cylindrical-section beryllium window, which allows an extensive range of reciprocal space to be probed. The chamber is primarily used to perform surface diffraction measurements, for which much of the most valuable information derives from the weakest signals. With this in mind, we have employed a photon-counting area pixel detector system, which reduces data acquisition times by one to two orders of magnitude and concomitantly increases the potential volume of data that can be acquired for any given sample before the surface degrades due to surface contamination or radiation damage.

Unplanned natural ecological experiments seldom meet these requirements. What unplanned experiments lack in rigor, they often make up for in an abundance of data that has the potential to make even weak signals detectable. To realize this potential the following conditions should be satisfied. (1) High taxonomic resolution is achieved in identification (species level if possible). (2) Species-specific tolerance values are available for most of the collected taxa. (3) An individual measure of impact is obtained for each taxon at a site. (4) All taxa are used in impact assessment. As a practical illustration we examine the effect of sedimentation from construction runoff on the population levels of stream benthic macroinvertebrates. Our purpose is to assess the efficacy of erosion- and sedimentation-control regulations and their enforcement in three North Carolina (USA) jurisdictions. Due to the asynchronous onset and duration of construction events, samples from different sites varied both in their timing and frequency. As a result, the benthos (both the kinds and numbers of taxa collected) overlapped so little between sites that the standard multimetric approaches to impact assessment were of little use. The typical multivariate methods of impact assessment examine changes at the community level. Our approach focuses on changes at the individual species level for all collected taxa. By correlating species-level population changes with known species-level tolerance values we are able to construct an impact score for each site along with a measure of its reliability. Impact scores are then used to test for jurisdiction differences using a weighted regression approach to analysis of variance. If the immediate goal of a study is not to assess the impact at a single site but to compare the degree of impact across a number of impacted sites and to relate this to one or more classification variables, then we believe this approach can be broadly applicable. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","ANOVA; BACI design; Benthic macroinvertebrates; Biotic indices; Event-based sampling; Impact analysis; North Carolina USA, central Piedmont region; Phenology; Sedimentation; Taxonomic resolution; Tolerance values; Weighted regression","community dynamics; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; Index of Biotic Integrity; population dynamics; sedimentation; tolerance; North America; North Carolina; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",,,,,"Agresti, A., (2002) Categorical Data Analysis, , John Wiley and Sons, New York, New York, USA; Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Thompson, W.L., Null hypothesis testing: Problems, prevalence, and an alternative (2000) Journal of Wildlife Management, 64, pp. 912-923; Bailey, R.C., Norris, R.H., Reynoldson, T.B., Taxonomic resolution of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in bioassessments (2001) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 20, pp. 280-286; Barbour, M.T., Gerritsen, J., Griffith, G.E., Frydenborg, R., McCarron, E., White, J.S., Bastian, M.L., A framework for biological criteria for Florida streams using benthic macroinvertebrates (1996) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 15, pp. 185-211; Barton, D.R., The use of percent model affinity to assess the effects of agriculture on benthic invertebrate communities in headwater streams of southern Ontario, Canada (1996) Freshwater Biology, 36, pp. 397-410; Barton, D.R., Farmer, M.E.D., The effects of conservation tillage practices on benthic invertebrate communities in headwater streams in southwestern Ontario, Canada (1997) Environmental Pollution, 96, pp. 207-215; Beisel, J.-N., Usseglio-Polatera, P., Moreteau, J.-C., The spatial heterogeneity of a river bottom: A key factor determining macroinvertebrate communities (2000) Hydrobiologia, 422-423, pp. 163-171; Benedetti-Cecchi, L., Beyond BACI: Optimization of environmental sampling designs through monitoring and simulation (2001) Ecological Applications, 11, pp. 783-799; Bowman, M.F., Bailey, R.C., Does taxonomic resolution affect the multivariate description of the structure of freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate communities?

The classic management methods are often too late; problems already exist. The theory of weak signals presented by Igor Ansoff raises the question of whether corrresponding signals exist in the project management sector. The signals and messages are always more or less inaccurate, as indicated in the fuzzy theory. The research shows that stimuli (signals) which comply with the information theory can be found in the project environment. These signals change into information when they are received and interpreted. There are also messages which can be interpreted to be preliminary warning signals. The research analyses the character of the signals, their appearance, what project problems they are related to, and what their basic reasons are. The continuation article analyses how the signals can be exploited in project control. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd and IPMA.","Early warning; Project management; Symptom; Weak signals","Decision theory; Fuzzy sets; PERT; Problem solving; Fast track projects; Project management",,,,,"Planning and scheduling terminology (1994) Cost Engineering Notebook; Lewis, P.J., (1993) The Project Manager's Desk Reference, , Probus Publishing Co., USA; Kezsbom, D.S., Schilling, D.L., Edward, K.A., (1989) Dynamic Project Management, , John Wiley & Son, USA; Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice Hall, USA; Åberg, L., (1989) Viesti - Tuloksen Tekijä (A Message - Result Producer), , Tietopaketti Oy, Helsinki; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, pp. 131-148; King, W.R., Strategic issue management (1987) Strategic Planning and Management Handbook, , eds W.

In this work, we present an RFlD-based solution, Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. Making sense of micro and high-frequency vibration using random and low-frequency readings of tag has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving sub-millisecond period accuracy. Our system achieves these three goals by discerning the change pattern of backscatter signal replied from the tag, which is attached on the vibrating surface and displaced by the vibration within a small range. This work introduces three main innovations. First, it shows how one can utilize COTS RFID to sense mechanical vibration and accurately discover its period with a few periods of short and noisy samples. Second, a new digital microscope is designed to amplify the micro-vibration-induced weak signals. Third, Tagbeat introduces compressive reading to inspect high-frequency vibration with relatively low RFID read rate. We implement Tagbeat using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that Tagbeat can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%.

Trends and rainfall indices are evaluated using non-parametric tests at different temporal levels. To overcome the sparse locally available network, the high resolution APHRODITE gridded dataset is used in addition to the existing rain gauges. Finally, existing linkages between discharge changes and trends in rainfall and temperature are explored. Results are indicative of an intensification of rainfall (+15%/decade), with more extreme and longer events. A significant increase in winter rainfall and a decrease in consecutive dry days provides strong evidence for a lengthening wet season in Central Vietnam. In addition, trends based on APHRODITE suggest a strong orographic signal in winter and annual trends. These results underline the local variability in the impacts of climatic change at the global scale. Consequently, it is important that change detection investigations are conducted at the local scale. A very weak signal is detected in the trend of minimum temperature (+0.2°C/decade). River discharge trends show an increase in mean discharge (31 to 35%/decade) over the last decades. Between 54 and 74% of this increase is explained by the increase in precipitation. The maximum discharge also responds significantly to precipitation changes leading to a lengthened wet season and an increase in extreme rainfall events. Such trends can be linked with a likely increase in floods in Central Vietnam, which is important for future adaptation planning and management and flood preparedness in the region. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","APHRODITE; Discharge; Mann-Kendall; Precipitation; Trend detection; Vietnam","APHRODITE; Discharge changes; Mann-Kendall; Minimum temperatures; Non-parametric test; Precipitation change; Trend detection; Viet Nam; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Flood control; Floods; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; climate change; extreme event; flood; rainfall; river discharge; trend analysis; Viet Nam",,,,,"Alexandersson, H., A homogeneity test applied to precipitation data (1986) International Journal of Climatology, 6 (6), pp. 661-675; Anyah, R.O., Qiu, W., Characteristic 20th and 21st century precipitation and temperature patterns and changes over the Greater Horn of Africa (2010) International Journal of Climatology, 32 (3), pp. 347-363. , 10.1002/joc.2270; Barua, S., Muttil, N., Ng, A.W.M., Perera, B.J.C., Rainfall trend and its implications for water resource management within the Yarra River catchment, Australia (2012) Hydrological Processes: n/a-n/a, , 10.1002/hyp.9311; Bayazit, M., Önöz, B., To prewhiten or not to prewhiten in trend analysis?

Identifying life signal and locating the position of human targets are two important research areas in this regard. Comparison with detecting moving human body, the static human's weak life signal, such as breathing and heartbeat are difficult to be identified due to the complex environment interference and weak signal response. In this paper, we build the complex environment model of two human subjects trapped in the earthquake ruins and apply finite difference time domain (FDTD) method to simulate the model response. The one is supinely postured on the side and another one is laterally postured. Advancements in signal processing may allow for improved imaging and analysis of complex targets. We first apply the correlation analysis and Curvelet transform to decompose the background signal, then use singular value decomposition (SVD) to remove noise in the life signals and present the results base on FFT and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) which combines with the Hilbert transform as the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to separate and extract characteristic frequencies of breathing and heartbeat, locate the target's position. The results demonstrate that this combination of UWB impulse radar and various processing methods has potential for identifying the life characteristic from the static human's weak response and also has high accuracy for target location. It is plausible to use this approach in disaster search and rescue operations such as people trapped under building debris during earthquake, explosion or fire. ©2012 IEEE.","FDTD simulation; Signal processing; Static human detection; UWB radar","Background signals; Characteristic frequencies; Complex environments; Complex targets; Correlation analysis; Curvelet transforms; Disaster relief; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; FDTD simulations; Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods; Hilbert Huang transforms; Hilbert transform; Human bodies; Human detection; Human subjects; Impulse radars; Life signals; Model response; Processing method; REmove noise; Search and rescue operations; Target location; Ultra wideband radars; UWB radars; Weak response; Weak signals; Debris; Disaster prevention; Earthquakes; Finite difference time domain method; Geological surveys; Ground penetrating radar systems; Signal detection; Signal processing; Singular value decomposition; Time domain analysis; Tracking radar; Ultra-wideband (UWB)",,,,,"Chamma, W.A., FDTD modelling of a realistic room for through the-wall radar applications (2007) Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain, pp. 1-4; Ahmad, F., Amin, M.G., Autofocusing of through-the-wall radar imagery under unknown wall characteristics (2007) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 16 (7), pp. 1785-1795; Ahmad, F., Amin, M.G., Kassam, S., Synthetic aperture beam former for imaging through a dielectric wall (2005) Aerospace and Electronic System, IEEE Transactions, 41 (1), pp. 271-283; Yarovoy, A.G., Ligthart, L.P., UWB radar for human being detection (2006) IEEE Aerosp.

However, weak information of road distress and computing complexity make it difficult to detect road distress effectively. In this paper, we describe pavement distress detection based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). The NSCT is based on a nonsubsampled pyramid structure and nonsubsampled directional filter banks. The coefficients in different scales and different directions are obtained by image decomposition using the nonsubsampled contourlet transform. After the enhancement of weak information and repress noise through adjustment the coefficients in NSCT subbands with proposed algorithm in this paper then reconstruction of these coefficients, pavement distress detection is implemented. Compared with other algorithms, this approach can get better effect especial for weak information. Experimental results proved that the proposed detection was an effective method for the pavement distress image in the practical application, which could inspect the weak object accurately. © 2008 IEEE.","Contourlet transform (CT); Nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT); Pavement distress detection; Weak signal","Automatic recognition; Computing complexity; Contourlet transform (CT); Different scale; Directional filter banks; Image decompositions; Nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT); Other algorithms; Pavement distress detection; Pyramid structures; Subbands; Weak signal; Computers; Filter banks; Fourier transforms; Pavements; Software engineering; Object recognition",,,,,"Tanaka, N., Uematsu, K., A Crack Detection Method In Road Surface Images Using Morphology (1998) MVA'98 LAPR Workshop on Machine Vision Applications, , Nov. 17-19, Makuhari, Chiba, Japan; Cheng, H.D., Automated real-time pavement distress detection using fuzzy logic and neural networks SPIE, 2946, pp. 140-151; Meignen, D., Bernadet, M., Briand, H., One Application of Neural Networks for Detection of Defects Using Video Data Bases: Identification of Road Distress (1997) IEEE, pp. 459-464; Bray, J., Verma, B., Li, X., He, W., A neural network based technique for automatic classification of road cracks (2006) International Joint on Neural Networks, pp. 907-912. , Canada, July 16-21; Do, M.N., Vetterli, M., The contourlet transform: An efficient directional multiresolution image representation (2005) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 14 (12), pp. 2091-2106; Burt, P.J., Adelson, E.H., The Laplacian pyramid as a compact image code (1983) IEEE Trans.

One of the prominent type of information that users look for while searching/browsing through such corpora is information around the people present in the Image/Video. While face recognition has matured to some extent over the past few years, this problem remains a hard one due to a) absence of labelled data for such a large set of celebrities that users look for and b) the variability of age/makeup/expressions/pose in the target corpus. We propose a learning paradigm which we refer to as consistency learning to address both these issues by posing the problem of learning from weakly labelled training set. We use the text-image co-occurrence on the web as a weak signal of relevance and learn the set of consistent face models from this very large and noisy training set. The resulting system learns face models for a large set of celebrities directly from the web and uses it to tag Image/Video for better retrieval. While the proposed method has been applied to faces, we see it broadly applicable in any learning problem with a suitable similarity metric defined. We present results on learning from a very large dataset of 37 million images resulting in a validation accuracy of 92.68%.

The current ability to identify and stop these kind of terrorists before they commit a terror act is limited since they are very hard to detect using traditional methods. However, these individuals often make use of Internet to spread their beliefs and opinions, and to obtain information and knowledge to plan an attack. Therefore, there is a good possibility that they leave digital traces in the form of weak signals that can be gathered, fused, and analyzed. In this work we present an analysis method that can be used to analyze extremist forums to profile possible lone wolf terrorists. This method is conceptually demonstrated using the FOI Impactorium fusion platform. We also present a number of different technologies that can be used to harvest and analyze information from Internet, serving as weak digital traces that can be fused using the suggested analysis method, in order to discover possible lone wolf terrorists. © 2012 IEEE.","affect analysis; intelligence analysis; natural language processing; NLP; text mining; weak signals","Affect analysis; Intelligence analysis; NAtural language processing; NLP; Text mining; Weak signals; Data mining; Information science; Internet; Natural language processing systems; Terrorism; Signal detection",,,,,"Abbasi, A., Chen, H., Affect intensity analysis of dark web forums Proceedings of the 5th IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics, 2007; Abcarian, R., Scott Roeder convicted of murdering abortion doctor George Tiller (2010) Los Angeles Times, , January 29; Bergin, A., Osman, S.B., Ungerer, C., Yasin, N.A.M., (2009) Countering Internet Radicalisation in Southeast Asia, , Technical Report 22, ASPI, March; Brynielsson, J., Horndahl, A., Kaati, L., Mårtenson, C., Svenson, P., Development of computerized support tools for intelligence work Proceedings of ICCRTS 2009, 2009; Brynielsson, J., Kaati, L., Svenson, P., Social positions and simulation relations (2012) Journal of Social Network Analysis and Mining, 2 (1), pp. 39-52; Burton, F., Stewart, S., The lone wolf disconnect (2008) Terrorism Intelligence Report - STRATFOR; Chen, H., Reid, E., Sinai, J., Silke, A., Ganor, B., Terrorism Informatics: Knowledge Management and Data Mining for Homeland Security (2008) Integrated Series in Information Systems, 18; (2007) Lone-wolf Terrorism, , COT Technical report, Instituut voor Veiligheidsen Crisismanagement; Fissette, M., (2010) Author Identification in Short Texts, , Master's thesis, Radboud University Nijmegen; Forsgren, R., Kaati, L., Mårtenson, C., Svenson, P., Tjörnhammar, E., An overview of the Impactorium tools Proceedings of SWIFT2008, 2008; Fredholm, M., Hunting lone wolves - Finding islamist lone actors before they strike Stockholm Seminar on Lone Wolf Terrorism, 2011; Gerstenfeld, P.B., Grant, D.R., Chiang, C.-P., Hate online: A content analysis of extremist internet sites (2003) Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 3 (1), pp. 29-44; Monika, R., Henzinger.

This paper aims at using a debate that took place in a specific foresight discussion arena on early detection and weak signal analysis, as a constructive epistemic detour to eventually contribute to such a reinforcement of Rosen's anticipatory system proposal. Design/methodology/approach: The author aims at revisiting Rosen's framework with stimulating inputs drawing upon the early detection debates, by first assessing the original concepts brought up by Ansoff in the 1970s and 1980s and its further enhancements by contemporary scholars. A rather constructivist approach is then developed to weak signal analysis, aiming at emphasising the need, in analytical situations involving social system features, for reflexive stages and capacities. Bearing this requirement in mind, the productive value of the framing and meta-framing notions is explored, in order to apply them to Rosen's anticipatory systems and possibly contribute to enriching his original concept. Findings: How effective the framing and meta-framing couple can be for a series of anticipatory issues is described in a detailed manner and, then more specifically, Rosen's anticipatory system concept is revisited in the light of those inputs, aiming at putting into perspective new options for research and anticipation activities in general. Research limitations/implications: The paper is essentially conceptual and based on a rich but disputable detour by early detection and weak analysis issues so as to emphasise key reflexive references and method. However, most of this material is taken from domains rather untypical of Rosennean debates and in addition would need to be completed by a series of supportive cases, but that is beyond the scope and scale of this paper. Practical implications: The paper sets clear distinctions and boundaries for when and when not to apply reflexive steps in a foresight exercise, including in the context of rolling out a Rosen type of approach. Research decision making both in the corporate and policy-making contexts can benefit from such clues and supportive framework conditions. Social implications: Social systems are typically complex and involve multiple perspectives and viewpoints; they concern a series of major challenges to be coped with locally or more globally, at environmental, political, cultural or technological level, and in that category of anticipatory endeavor, the framing/meta-framing epistemic couple may be of great usefulness. Originality/value: Although rather conceptual, the detour proposed by the paper aims at creating a reflexive distance and enriched capability to evaluate one's potential biases and blind spots in anticipatory modelling activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Communication technologies; Complexity theory; Environmental management; Governance; Innovation",,,,,,"Adam, B., Has the future already happened?

We show on two problems how large deviation methodology applies. First, when some oligomer H occurs more often than expected, e.g. may be overrepresented, large deviations allow for a very efficient computation of the so-called p-value. The second problem we address is the possible changes in the oligomers distribution induced by the over-representation of some pattern. Discarding this noise allows for the detection of weaker signals. Related algorithmic and complexity issues are discussed and compared to previous results. The approach is illustrated with three typical examples of applications on biological data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.",,"Bioinformatics; Oligomers; Oligonucleotides; Parallel processing systems; Biological data; Complexity issues; Computational biology; Efficient computation; Large deviations; P-values; Statistical significance; Computational complexity",,,,,"Beaudoing, E., Freier, S., Wyatt, J., Claverie, J.M., Gautheret, D., Patterns of Variant Polyadenylation Signal Usage in Human Genes (2000) Genome Research., 10, pp. 1001-1010; Buhler, J., Tompa, M., Finding Motifs Using Random Projections RECOMB’01, pp. 69-76. , ACM-,2001.

In this paper, the detection of weak known and random signals is addressed in observations corrupted by multiplicative and first-order Markov additive noises. The asymptotic and finite sample-size performance of several detectors are obtained and compared: it is confirmed that the dependence of noise components need to be taken into account to maintain detection performance appropriately. © 2008 IEEE.","Known signal; Locally optimum detector; Markov noise; Multiplicative noise; Nonadditive components; Random signal; Signal detection; Weak signal","Additive noise; Data communication systems; Mathematical models; Signal interference; Spurious signal noise; Markov noise; Multiplicative noise; Weak signal; Signal detection",,,,,"Rao, C., Hassibi, B., Analysis of multiple-antenna wireless links at low SNR (2004) IEEE Trans.

Two approaches are studied: either the signal with shortest distance to the observed data or the signal having maximal correlation with some transformation of the observed data is chosen. With a weak signal approach, the limiting error probability is a monotone function of the Pitman efficacy and it is the same for both the distance-based and correlation-based detectors. Using the minimax theory of Huber, it is possible to derive robust choices of distance/correlation when the limiting error probability is used as performance criterion. This generalizes previous work in the area, from two signals to an arbitrary number of signals. We consider M-type and R-type distances and also one-dimensional as well as two-dimensional signals. Finally, some Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the finite sample size error probabilities with the asymptotic error probabilities. © 1993 IEEE.","Additive noise; asymptotic error probability; known signals; M-statistic; maximum correlation; minimum distance; multiple classification; R-statistic; robustness; weak signals","Computer simulation; Monte Carlo methods; Spurious signal noise; Statistical methods; Additive noise; Error probabilities; Hypothesis testing; Manimax theory; Multiple classifcation; Pitman efficacy; Signal classification; Signal detection",,,,,"Bickel, P.J., One-step Huber estimates in the linear model (1975) J.

FTA practitioners have used frequently one or a suitable mixture of these methods for their activities. Changing policy and strategy making contexts as well as enabling technologies increased the need and possibility for performing adaptive Foresight studies in order to improve decision making about the future and using making better use of limited resources. This study performs a scientometric analysis of the publications in the major FTA journals with the aim of understanding the dynamics of using Foresight methods across time. Among the other branches of FTA, including forecasting, futures, and technology assessment, a special emphasis is given on Foresight as a systematic and inclusive way of exploring long term futures, developing visions and formulating policies for action. The study aims at detecting the key Trends and Weak Signals regarding the use of existing methods and emerging ones with potential uses for Foresight activities. Further implications will be achieved with the generation of networks for quantitative and qualitative methods. This will demonstrate the most frequently combined Foresight methods by researchers and practitioners. Where possible the methods will also be cross-fertilised with the key thematic areas to illustrate the relationships between policy domains and industrial sectors covered by the scope of study with methodological choice. This output is considered to be taken as a methodological guide for any researchers, practitioners or policy makers, who might embark upon or involved in a Foresight activity. Further outputs of the study will include the identification of centres of excellence in the use of Foresight methods and collaboration networks between countries, institutions and policy domains. Overall, the paper demonstrates how scientometric tools can be used to understand the dynamics of evolution in a research field. Thus, it provides an overview of the use of methods in Foresight, and how it is distinguished from the other FTA activities; the evolutionary characteristics of methodological design and factors influencing the choice of methods; and finally a discussion on the future potentials for new cutting-edge approaches. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Foresight; Foresight methods; FTA; Scientometrics",,,,,,"(2009) Mapping Foresight: revealing how Europe and other world regions navigate into the future, European Foresight Monitoring Network (EFMN), , European Commission, Brussels; Hess, D.J., (1997) Science studies: An advanced introduction, , New York University Press, New York; Keller, J., von der Gracht, H.A., The influence of information and communication technology (ICT) on future Foresight process—Results from a Delphi survey (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 85, pp. 81-92; www.cgee.org.br/atividades/redirKori/290, Miles, I., & Keenan, M.

Existing approaches for identifying weak signals in strategic decision making use environmental scanning procedures based on standard filtering algorithms. These algorithms discard patterns with low information content; however, they are not able to discard patterns with low relevance to a given strategic problem. Idea mining is proposed as an algorithm that identifies relevant textual patterns from documents or websites to solve a given (strategic) problem. Thus, it enables to estimate patterns' relevance to the given strategic problem. The provided new methodology that combines weak signal analysis and idea mining is in contrast to existing methodologies. In a case study, a web-based scanning procedure is implemented to identify textual internet data in the field of self-sufficient energy supply. Idea mining is applied for filtering and weak signals are identified based on the proposed approach. The proposed approach is compared to a further - already evaluated - approach processed without using idea mining. The results show that idea mining filtering improves quality of weak signal analysis. This supports decision makers by providing early and suggestive signals of potentially emerging trends, even with only little expressive strength. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Idea mining; Strategic decision making;

The vector β] is unknown but is sparse in the sense that most of its coordinates are 0. The main interest is to separate its nonzero coordinates from the zero ones (i.e., variable selection). Motivated by examples in long-memory time series (Fan and Yao [Nonlinear Time Series: Nonparametric and Parametric Methods (2003) Springer]) and the change-point problem (Bhattacharya [In Change-Point Problems (South Hadley, MA, 1992) (1994) 28-56 IMS]), we are primarily interested in the case where the Gram matrix G = X'X is nonsparse but sparsifiable by a finite order linear filter. We focus on the regime where signals are both rare and weak so that successful variable selection is very challenging but is still possible. We approach this problem by a new procedure called the covariate assisted screening and estimation (CASE). CASE first uses a linear filtering to reduce the original setting to a new regression model where the corresponding Gram (covariance) matrix is sparse. The new covariance matrix induces a sparse graph, which guides us to conduct multivariate screening without visiting all the submodels. By interacting with the signal sparsity, the graph enables us to decompose the original problem into many separated smallsize subproblems (if only we know where they are!). Linear filtering also induces a so-called problem of information leakage, which can be overcome by the newly introduced patching technique. Together, these give rise to CASE, which is a two-stage screen and clean [Fan and Song Ann. Statist. 38 (2010) 3567-3604; Wasserman and Roeder Ann. Statist. 37 (2009) 2178-2201] procedure, where we first identify candidates of these submodels by patching and screening, and then re-examine each candidate to remove false positives. For any procedure β]. for variable selection, we measure the performance by the minimax Hamming distance between the sign vectors of β]. and β]. We show that in a broad class of situations where the Gram matrix is nonsparse but sparsifiable, CASE achieves the optimal rate of convergence. The results are successfully applied to long-memory time series and the change-point model. © 2014 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.","Asymptotic minimaxity; Graph of least favorables (GOLF); Graph of strong dependence (GOSD); Hamming distance; Multivariate screening; Phase diagram; Rare and weak signal model; Sparsity; Variable selection",,,,,,"Andreou, E., Ghysels, E., Detecting multiple breaks in financial market volatility dynamics (2002) J.

When conventional estimators work in unfavorable scenarios, e.g., at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with a small number of snapshots, or for sources with a different strength, it is challenging to maintain good performance. In this paper, the detection limit of the minimum description length (MDL) estimator and the signal strength required for reliable detection are first discussed. Though a comparison, we analyze the reason that performances of classical estimators deteriorate completely in unfavorable scenarios. After discussing the limiting distribution of eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix, we propose a new approach for estimating the number of sources which is based on a sequential hypothesis test. The new estimator performs better in unfavorable scenarios and is consistent in the traditional asymptotic sense. Finally, numerical evaluations indicate that the proposed estimator performs well when compared with other traditional estimators at low SNR and in the finite sample size case, especially when weak signals are superimposed on the strong signals. © 2012, IEEE.

Signal-to-noise ratios are assumed unknown and the signals at the different sensors may be statistically dependent. Analytical expressions are provided that describe the best way to fuse the quantized observations for cases with any given number of sensors. The best schemes for originally quantizing the observations at each sensor are also studied for the case of an asymptotically large number of sensors. These schemes are shown to minimize the mean-squared error between the best weak-signal test statistic based on unquantized observations and the best weak-signal test statistic based on quantized observations. Analytical expressions describing optimum sensor quantizers are provided. The approach used to obtain these expressions insures these sensor quantizers give good performance for cases with a finite number of sensors. A novel iterative technique to search for optimum sensor quantizers efficiently is described. Numerical solutions are presented, some of which involve cases where the best schemes for independent signal observations are shown to be suboptimum. © 1998 IEEE.","Asymptotically optimum quantization; Decentralized detection; Distributed detection; Distributed quantization; Quantization for detection","Decision theory; Error analysis; Iterative methods; Random processes; Sensors; Signal to noise ratio; Spurious signal noise; Statistics; Decentralized detection; Distributed detection; Distributed quantization; Multibit sensor decisions; Signal detection",,,,,"Viswanathan, R., Varshney, P.K., Distributed detection with multiple sensors - Part I: Fundamentals (1997) Proc.

The in-phase and quadrature components of the received narrowhand observation at each sensor consist of a common weak random signal in additive Gaussian combined clutter and noise. The sensors use cell-averaging CFAR tests to each generate binary decisions which are sent to a fusion center.

This is a challenging task as photons propagate predominantly diffusively (rather than ballistically) due to random multiple scattering off the inhomogenieties. Real-time imaging with ballistic light under continuous-wave illumination is even more challenging due to the extremely weak signal, necessitating voluminous data-processing. Here we report imaging through strongly scattering media in real-time and at rates several times the critical flicker frequency of the eye, so that motion is perceived as continuous. Two factors contributed to the speedup of more than three orders of magnitude over conventional techniques - the use of a simplified algorithm enabling processing of data on the fly, and the utilisation of task and data parallelization capabilities of typical desktop computers. The extreme simplicity of the technique, and its implementation with present day low-cost technology promises its utility in a variety of devices in maritime, aerospace, rail and road transport, in medical imaging and defence. It is of equal interest to the common man and adventure sportsperson like hikers, divers, mountaineers, who frequently encounter situations requiring realtime imaging through obscuring media.

We identify and estimate the model with a large panel that matches data on publicly listed firms to information on their executives. The structural estimates obtained are used to decompose the firm-size pay gap. We find that although total compensation and incentive pay increase with firm size, certainty-equivalent pay decreases with firm size. In larger firms, and for more highly ranked executives, weaker signal quality about effort results in higher risk premiums. This risk premium accounts for roughly 80 percent of the firm-size gap in total compensation. Larger firms are also willing to pay more than smaller ones to attract executives. Finally, the estimated coefficients on human capital accumulation from formal education and experience gained from different firms are individually significant, but their collective effect on firm-size pay differentials nets out. © 2015 The Econometric Society.","asymmetric information; career concern; compensating differential; executive compensation; firm-size pay differential; identification; moral hazard; sequential equilibrium; structural estimation; Agency cost",,,,,,"Alchian, A.A., Demsetz, H., Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization (1972) American Economic Review, 62, pp. 777-795; Altug, S., Miller, R.A., The Effect of Work Experience on Female Wages and Labour Supply (1998) Review of Economic Studies, 65, pp. 45-85; Andersen, S., Harrison, G.W., Lau, M.I., Rutstrom, E.E., Eliciting Risk and Time Preferences (2008) Econometrica, 76, pp. 583-618; Antle, R., Smith, A., Measuring Executive Compensation: Methods and an Application (1985) Journal of Accounting Research, 23, pp. 296-325; Antle, R., Smith, A., An Empirical Investigation of the Relative Performance Evaluation of Corporate Executives (1986) Journal of Accounting Research, 24, pp. 1-39; Antonovics, K., Golan, L., Experimentation and Job Choice (2012) Journal of Labor Economics, 30, pp. 333-366; Aron, D.J., Ability, Moral Hazard, Firm Size, and Diversification (1988) Rand Journal of Economics, 19, pp. 72-87; Baker, G.P., Hall, B.J., CEO Incentives and Firm Size (2004) Journal of Labor Economics, 22, pp. 767-798; Bayer, P., Khan, S., Timmins, C., Nonparametric Identification and Estimation in a Roy Model With Common Nonpecuniary Returns (2011) Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 29, pp. 201-215; Becker, G.S., (1964) Human Capital, , New York: National Bureau for Economic Research; Bellman, R., (1957) Dynamic Programming, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Ben-Porath, Y., The Production of Human Capital and the Life Cycle of Earnings (1967) Journal of Political Economy, 75, pp. 352-365; Brown, C., Medoff, J., The Employer Size-Wage Effect (1989) Journal of Political Economy, 97, pp. 1027-1059; Cahuc, P., Postel-Vinay, F., Robin, J.M., Wage Bargaining With on-the-Job Search: Theory and Evidence (2006) Econometrica, 74, pp. 323-364; Calvo, G.A., Wellisz, S., Technology, Entrepreneurs, and Firm Size (1980) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 95, pp. 663-677; Chevalier, J., Ellison, G., Career Concerns of Mutual Fund Managers (1999) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114, pp. 389-432; Debreu, G., (1959) Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium, 17. , Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics Monograph.

While the relevance of dealing with trends is constantly underlined, the effects of labeling phenomena as trends and megatrends in an organizational context have not been widely discussed. In particular, the dangers of dealing with megatrend semantics are that the strategic implications of these phenomena are unclear and that an organization is likely to increase its blind spots, thereby actually undermining its foresight capability.This paper applies a discourse-theoretical perspective developed by Ernesto Laclau and Chantalle Mouffe to trend management in organizations. It argues that megatrends can be perceived as empty signifiers, as they provide an overdetermined, abstract form of meaning that addresses discourses but cannot convey concrete meaning for management. It is proposed that instead of concentrating on megatrends (empty signifiers), trend management should reconstruct those elements of a discourse in which shifts of meaning can be observed, detecting and understanding the nodal points of a discourse. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Discourse theory; Empty signifier; Megatrends; Nodal points; Trends","detection method; management; organizational framework; strategic approach; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic response in turbulent environments (1982) Working Paper no 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision-making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21, pp. 307-320; Martinet, A.-C., Strategic planning, strategic management, strategic foresight: the seminal work of H.

Many futurists are developing foresight of future technologies based on Delphi studies, unfolding history, brainstorming, expert surveys, trend analysis, data mining, and so on. However, formalizing these processes is still a necessary task. In this paper, we introduce the NEST (New and Emerging Signals of Trends) model developed by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI). The NEST collects information from worldwide expert networks and detects the weak signals of emerging future trends systematically, based on massive data analysis, inference techniques, and Delphi studies, to support the development of foresight of future research and technology. The NEST model combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. In the quantitative approach stages, NEST uses clustering, pattern recognition, and cross-impact analysis using a Bayesian network. In the stages of qualitative approaches, NEST conducts environmental scanning, brainstorming, and a Delphi study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bayesian network; Delphi study; Emerging trend; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative analysis; Weak signal","Bayesian analysis; decision making; Delphi analysis; detection method; future prospect; model; quantitative analysis; research and development; science and technology; technology adoption; trend analysis; Korea",,,,,"Zhang, D., Extracting social and community intelligence from digital footprints: an emerging research area (2010) UIC'10 Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, , Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, Xi'an, China; Chen, W., Social network analysis supporting collaborative knowledge building (2009) SOCINFO '09 Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Social Informatics, , IEEE Computer Society; Zhuhadar, L., Visual knowledge representation of conceptual semantic networks (2010) Social Network Anal.

Collective detection combines correlations from multiple satellites prior to detection in a direct-to-navigation solution algorithm without performing separate acquisition and tracking functions. In relatively clear conditions, a final positioning accuracy of 15 m was obtained with 3 ms of data, beginning with an a priori uncertainty of ±10 km horizontal, 200 m vertical, and 1 ms in clock. In high blockage environments of a courtyard and balcony 45 m horizontal positioning accuracy was achieved with the same initial uncertainties and 3 to 5 ms of signal samples. These findings demonstrate the utility of collective detection and direct positioning in poor signal environments where conventional tracking and navigation solutions are not feasible. In addition it can provide a robust initialization for or validation of filtered solutions obtained using conventional GPS tracking measurements.",,"Detection algorithm; GPS signals; GPS tracking; Multiple satellites; Navigation solution; Performance analysis; Positioning accuracy; Priori uncertainty; Signal environment; Signal samples; Solution algorithms; Tracking function; Weak signals; Algorithms; Navigation; Satellites; Signal detection; Global positioning system",,,,,"Axelrad, P., Donna, J., Mitchell, M., Enhancing GNSS Acquisition by Combining Signals from Multiple Channels and Satellites (2009) ION GNSS-2009, Savannah, GA, pp. 2617-2628. , September 22-25; Borio, D., O'Driscoll, C., Lachapelle, G., Coherent, Non-Coherent, and Differentially Coherent Combining Techniques for the Acquisition of New Composite GNSS Signals IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, May 2008; Borio, D., Camoriano, L., Lo Presti, L., Impact of GPS Acquisition Strategy on Decision Probabilities (2008) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 44 (3), pp. 996-1011. , July; Borre, K., Akos, D.M., (2007) A Software-Defined GPS and Galileo Receiver; Closas, P., Fernández-Prades, C., Fernández-Rubio, J.A., Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Position in GNSS (2007) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 14 (5), pp. 359-362. , May; Closas, P., Fernández-Prades, C., Fernández-Rubio, J.A., Cramér-Rao Bound Analysis of Positioning Approaches in GNSS Receivers (2009) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 57 (10). , October; DiEsposti, R., GPS PRN Code Signal Processing and Receiver Design for Simultaneous All-in-View Coherent Signal Acquisition and Navigation Solution Determination ION NTM 2007, pp. 91-103; Gustafson, D., Dowdle, J., Deeply Integrated Code Tracking: Comparative Performance Analysis ION GPS 2003; Haddrell, T., Pratt, A.R., Understanding the Indoor GPS Signal ION GPS 2001, pp. 1487-1499; Misra, P., Enge, P., (2006) Global Positioning System - Signals, Measurements, and Performance, , 2nd Edition; O'Driscoll, C., (2007) Performance Analysis of the Parallel Acquisition of Weak GPS Signals, , PhD Dissertation, National University of Ireland, Cork; Pany, T., Eissfeller, B., Deep Integration of Navigation Solution and Signal Processing (2005) ION GNSS 2005, Long Beach, pp. 1095-1102; Psiaki, M.L., Block Acquisition of Weak GPS Signals in a Software Receiver ION GPS 2001, pp. 2838-2850; Watson, Investigating GPS Signals Indoors with Extreme High-Sensitivity Detection Techniques (2005) Navigation, 52 (4), pp. 199-213. , Winter","Bradley, B.

First, the principle of this technique was analyzed. Secondly, the method was verified by an experimental study on optoelectric sensor. In the experiment, an optical shaped function signal was imposed upon the sensor, combined with the faint optical signal. After oversampling, the obtained data shows that this method can improve optoelectric sensor's resolving power effectively. This provides a feasible measure for the detection of faint signal. It has also opened a new path to upgrade the sensor's resolution and detection sensitivity.","Oversampling; Sensitivity; Sensor; Shaped function","Detection sensitivity; Experimental studies; Optical signals; Over sampling; Resolving power; Sensitivity; Shaped function; Weak signals; Sensors; Signal detection",,,,,"Dhulla, V., Gudkov, G., Stepoukhovitch, A., Single photon detection module for multi-channel detection of weak fluorescence signals (2005) Proceedings of SPIE: Smart Medical and Biomedical Sensor Technology(III), p. 600719. , Bellingham WA, USA: International Society for Optical Engineering; Du, S., Zhang, D., Shi, Y., Experimental study of amplification on extreme faint optical signal with picoseconds BBO-OPG system (2007) Chinese Journal of Quantum Electronics, 24 (1), p. 126. , (in Chinese); Fercher, A.F., Drexler, W., Hitzenberger, C.K., Optical coherence tomography: Principles and applications (2003) Reports on Progress in Physics, 66, pp. 239-303; Lin, L., Hong, Q., Li, G., The application of analog multiplier MLT04 in the high accuracy phase lock-in detecting circuit for faint optical signal (2005) Optoelectronic Technology, 25 (4), pp. 263-266. , (in Chinese); Zhang, Y., Zhao, Y., Liu, L., Detection of weak signal in laser ranging based on the theory of stochastic resonance (2005) Lasers and Laser Technologies, (6028), p. 602815; Vrcelj, B., Vaidyanathan, P.P., Equalization with oversampling in multiuser CDMA systems (2005) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 53 (5), pp. 1837-1851; Lim, S., Apostolopoulos, J., Gamal, A.E., Benefits of temporal oversampling in optical flow estimation (2004) 2004 International Conference on Image Processing, 4, pp. 2567-2570. , Los Angeles, USA; Sharif, M., Gharavi-Alkhansari, M., Khalaj, B.H., On the peak-to-average power of OFDM signals based on oversampling (2003) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 51 (1), pp. 72-78; Li, G., Zhang, L., Lin, L., Research of bioelectricity signal detection based on oversampling (2008) Acta Electronica Sinica, 36 (7), pp. 1465-1467. , (in Chinese); Oppenheim, A.V., Scharer, R.W., Buck, J.R., (2001) Discrete-Time Signal Processing. 2nd ed, , Liu Shutang, Huang Jianguo, Trans.

We explore, theoretically, the influence of thermal noise in arrays of metal nanoparticles functionalised with organic ligands acting as tunnelling junctions, with emphasis on the interplay between the SR phenomena and the nanostructure variability. In this system, the transference of a reduced number of electrons may suffice to implement a variety of electronic functions. However, because nanostructures are expected to show a significant variability in their physical characteristics, it is important to study the relation between the diversity-induced static noise and the dynamic noise caused by thermal fluctuations. We consider an ideal model based on the Coulomb blockade and tunnelling effects that includes the stochastic nature of electron transference due to thermal noise together with the nanostructure variability found in experimental distribution functions. The correlation between the input (potential) and the output (current) signals, as well as the absolute value of the current and its time fluctuations, are analysed as a function of the temperature and the number of nanostructures. Extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the interplay between thermal noise and variability could permit reliable processing of weak signals with many non-identical nanostructures. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Absolute values; Dynamic noise; Electronic functions; Ideal model; Influence of thermal noise; Input signal; Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation; Metal nanoparticles; Number of electrons; Organic ligands; Parallel arrays; Physical characteristics; Static noise; Stochastic nature; Stochastic resonances; Thermal fluctuations; Tunnelling junctions; Weak signals; Circuit resonance; Computer simulation; Linear systems; Magnetic resonance; Monte Carlo methods; Nanostructures; Signal processing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Thermal noise; Tunneling (excavation); Distribution functions",,,,,"Gammaitoni, L., Hanggi, P., Jung, P., Marchesoni, F., (1998) Rev.

In practice, the background covariance is estimated from samples in the image, and imprecision in this estimate can lead to a loss of detection power. In this paper, we describe the sparse matrix transform (SMT) and investigate its utility for estimating the covariance matrix from a limited number of samples. The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordinate (Givens) rotations. Experiments on hyperspectral data show that the estimate accurately reproduces even small eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In particular, we find that using the SMT to estimate the co-variance matrix used in the adaptive matched filter leads to consistently higher signal-to-clutter ratios. © 2009 IEEE.","Covariance matrix; Hyperspectral imagery; Matched filter; Signal detection; Sparse matrix transform","Adaptive matched filters; Co-variance; Covariance estimation; Detection algorithm; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral image analysis; Hyperspectral imagery; Matched filters; Number of samples; Signal-to-clutter ratios; Solid targets; Sparse matrices; Weak signal detection; Atmospherics; Covariance matrix; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Estimation; Image analysis; Online searching; Radar target recognition; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Signal processing",,,,,"Reed, I.S., Mallett, J.D., Brennan, L.E., Rapid convergence rate in adaptive arrays (1974) IEEE Trans.

The main focus is on wideband A/D conversion where a collection of different waveforms at different frequency channels is digitized as a whole. The overall dynamic range in such composite signal can easily be in the order of tens of dB's, especially in the emerging cognitive radio type developments, and the nonlinear distortion due to strong carriers can easily block the weaker signal bands. In this article, DSP-based post-processing is proposed and demonstrated for reducing the effects of A/D converter integral nonlinearities (INL), stemming from unintentional deviations in the quantization intervals, as well as clipping due to improper input conditioning in wideband radio receiver context. © 2009 IEEE.","A/D converter; Clipping; Integral nonlinearity; Interference cancellation; Nonlinear distortion; Radio receiver","A/D conversion; A/D converter; Analog to digital converters; Cognitive radio; Different frequency; DSP-based; Dynamic range; Integral nonlinearity; Interference cancellation; Non-Linearity; Post processing; Signal band; Wave forms; Wide-band; Analog to digital conversion; Digital signal processors; Nonlinear distortion; Radio interference; Radio receivers; Signal processing; Digital radio",,,,,"Mak, P.-I., U, S.-P., Martins, R.P., Transceiver architecture selection: Review, state-of-the-art survey and case study (2007) IEEE Circuits and Systems Mag., 7, pp. 6-25. , 2nd quarter; Rusu, A., Rodriguez De Llera Gonzalez, D., Ismail, M., Reconfigurable ADCs enable smart radios for 4G wireless connectivity (2006) IEEE Circuits and Devices Mag., 22 (3), pp. 6-11. , May-June; Araujo, T., Dinis, R., Analytical evaluation and optimization of the ADC (analog-to-digital converter) in software radio architectures (2004) Proc.

Traditionally, it has been discussed in respect to telecommunications, information technologies and electronics. Subjects of this convergence often change what and where customers buy, with Apple's renowned iPhone being one current example for customers' tendency towards products with multiple benefits. More recently also the chemical and its related industries find themselves affected by a larger convergence process. Concentrating on developments at the outposts of the chemical industry, we discuss indications of convergence with an example from the area of Nutraceuticals and Cosmeceuticals. Furthermore, we present and discuss a multiple indicator concept for monitoring convergence in an R&D-intensive field on the basis of publicly available data. We analyze 7, 455 scientific and patent references on phytosterols with the aid of SciFinder Scholar and 3, 836 documents employing STN AnaVist. Our results show clear indications for convergence and a proof of principle for our monitoring concept. A closer look at convergence and effective tools for spotting weak signals appears to be necessary. Particularly for practitioners, the opportunity to get a head start on their current and future competitors is of high strategic importance. © 2009 PICMET.",,"Convergence process; Cosmeceuticals; Effective tool; Nutraceuticals; Proof of principles; Scientific discipline; Weak signals; Chemical industry; Competition; Customer satisfaction; Technology",,,,,"Agrawal, A., Henderson, R., Putting patents in context: Exploring knowledge transfer from MIT (2002) Management Science, 48, pp. 44-60. , Jan; Bainbridge, W.S., Transformative Concepts in Scientific Convergence (2006) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1093, pp. 24-45; Bierly, P., Chakrabarti, A.K., Managing through industry fusion (1999) The dynamics of innovation: Strategic and managerial implications, pp. 7-26. , K.

The measure of similarity (ZM) is an F-distributed test statistic that quantifies the degree of alignment, correlation or coincidence between two or more (time- or space-dependent) waveforms. The test statistic may he used to automate detection, classification, localisation, association and registration operations. When used to estimate time-of-arrival differences, which is typically done using cross correlation or beam formation, the technique provides an efficient means of: maintaining a low and constant false-alarm rate, detecting weak signals in noise and reducing angular errors. The method is applied to the problem of acoustic source detection and localisation. Real data are used to compare the method with cross correlation and normalised cross correlation. The new method yields prominent and narrow peaks, at the true source locations, with false peaks due to misalignment, misassociation, and background noise, suppressed. When processing continuous data streams, the test statistic is computed efficiently in the time domain. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Beamforming; Correlation methods; Digital signal processing; Error analysis; Signal detection; Statistical tests; Waveform analysis; Automate detection; Beam formation; Signal similarity; Signal analysis",,,,,"Patent Pending, Provisional Application No. 2006901479, Signal Analysis Methods, Mar. 2006; Van Veen, B.D., Buckley, K.M., Beamforming: A versatile approach to spatial filtering (1988) IEEE ASSP Mag, 5, pp. 4-24. , Apr; Knapp, C.H., Carter, G.C., The Generalized Correlation Method for Estimation of Time Delay (1976) IEEE Trans.

These efforts are typically costly and will be ineffective if habitat is not limiting. Therefore it is important to assess, rather than assume, habitat limitation wherever habitat rehabilitation projects are considered. Catch-count data from a standardized probability-based stratified-random monitoring programme were examined for indirect evidence of backwater habitat limitation by centrarchid fishes in the Upper Mississippi River System. The monitoring design enabled fitting statistical models of the association between mean catch at the spatial scale of tens of river kilometres and the percentage of contiguous aquatic area in backwater at least 1 m deep by maximizing a stratum-area weighted negative binomial log-likelihood function. Statistical models containing effects for backwater limitation failed to account for substantial variation in the data. However, 95% confidence intervals on the backwater parameter estimates excluded zero, indicating that population abundance may be limited by backwater prevalence where backwaters are extremely scarce. The combined results indicate, at most, a weak signal of backwater limitation where backwaters are extremely scarce in the lower reaches, but not elsewhere in the Upper Mississippi River System. This suggests that habitat restoration projects designed to increase the area of backwaters suitable for winter survival of centrarchids are unlikely to produce measurable benefits over intermediate spatial scales in much of the Upper Mississippi River System, and indicates the importance of correct identification of limiting processes.

This paper presents one of two modifications of linear TFA to provide the enhanced detailing behavior of quadratic TFAs without introducing cross terms, making it possible to see the time-frequency detail of extremely weak signal components. The technique described is based on subspace-enhanced linear predictive extrapolation of the data within each analysis window to create a longer data sequence for conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT) TFA.

However, the applications of layered materials in optoelectronic devices are hampered by the low light absorption of monolayers/few layers, the lack of p-n junction, and the challenges for large-scale production. Here, we report a scalable production of β-In 2 Se 3 /Si heterojunction arrays using pulsed-laser deposition. Photodetectors based on the as-produced heterojunction array are sensitive to a broadband wavelength from ultraviolet (370 nm) to near-infrared (808 nm), showing a high responsivity (5.9 A/W), a decent current on/off ratio (∼600), and a superior detectivity (4.9 × 10 12 jones), simultaneously. These figures-of-merits are among the best values of the reported heterojunction-based photodetectors. In addition, these devices can further enable the detection of weak signals, as successfully demonstrated with weak light sources including a flashlight, lighter, and fluorescent light. Device physics modeling shows that their high performance is attributed to the strong light absorption of the relatively thick β-In 2 Se 3 film (20.3 nm) and the rational energy band structures of β-In 2 Se 3 and Si, which allows efficient separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. These results offer a new insight into the rational design of optoelectronic devices from the synergetic effect of layered materials as well as mature semiconductor technology. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","layered materials; p-n junction; photodetector array; weak signal detection; β-In 2 Se 3 /Si heterojunction","Band structure; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Heterojunctions; Infrared devices; Light absorption; Light sources; Optoelectronic devices; Photodetectors; Photons; Pulsed laser deposition; Self assembly; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor devices; Semiconductor junctions; Large scale productions; Layered material; P-n junction; Photo detector array; Photoexcited electron-hole pairs; Scalable production; Semiconductor technology; Weak signal detection; Signal detection",,,,,"Novoselov, K.S., Geim, A.K., Morozov, S.V., Jiang, D., Zhang, Y., Dubonos, S.V., Grigorieva, I.V., Firsov, A.A., Electric Field Effect in Atomically Thin Carbon Films (2004) Science, 306, pp. 666-669; Mannix, A.J., Zhou, X.-F., Kiraly, B., Wood, J.D., Alducin, D., Myers, B.D., Liu, X., Guest, J.R., Synthesis of Borophenes: Anisotropic, Two-dimensional Boron Polymorphs (2015) Science, 350, pp. 1513-1516; Lopez-Sanchez, O., Lembke, D., Kayci, M., Radenovic, A., Kis, A., Ultrasensitive Photodetectors Based on Monolayer MoS 2 (2013) Nat.

Why do men and women respond differently to invitations to seek office? We hypothesize that women view party recruitment as a weaker signal of informal support than men do. We use a survey experiment on a sample of 3,640 elected municipal officeholders—themselves prospective recruits for higher office—to test this. We find that female respondents generally believe party leaders will provide female recruits less strategic and financial support than male recruits. In other words, even when elites recruit women, women are skeptical that party leaders will use their political and social capital on their behalf. This difference may account for many women’s lukewarm responses to recruitment. © 2016, © 2016 University of Utah.","experiment; gender; local politics; recruitment",,,,,,"Borgatti, S.P., Cross, R., A Relational View of Information Seeking and Learning in Social Networks (2003) Management Science, 49 (4), pp. 432-445; Bos, A.L., The Unintended Effects of Political Party Affirmative Action Policies on Female Candidates’ Nomination Chances (2015) Politics, Groups, and Identities, 3 (1), pp. 73-93; Broockman, D.E., Mobilizing Candidates: Political Actors Strategically Shape the Candidate Pool with Personal Appeals (2014) Journal of Experimental Political Science, 1 (2), pp. 104-119; Butler, D.M., Kousser, T., How Do Public Goods Providers Play Public Goods Games?

The major objectives of the ESA Moon-GNSS project have been to determine the feasibility of using GNSS (GPS/Galileo) weak-signal technology in future lunar missions to improve the navigation performance in terms of accuracy, cost reduction and autonomy. The Moon mission scenario is very challenging for the GNSS signals processing: less visibility compared to an Earth-based receiver, low signal strength, poor satellite geometry, Earth and Moon signal occultation, and spacecraft dynamics. The identification of the Moon-GNSS navigation receiver requirements for the upcoming lunar exploration missions has been performed. The impact of the receiver requirements on the Moon-GNSS receiver module architecture and algorithms has been analyzed (weak signal processing, filtering and navigation), including an overview of the state of the art space-borne GNSS receivers. Besides, the synergies between GNSS signal/navigation processing and other navigation sensors (i.e. accelerometers, optical camera, laser altimeter) have been analyzed, using the state of the art of sensors integration for space missions. A demonstrator of the weak-signal Moon-GNSS navigation has been designed and implemented, showing the main functional and performance capabilities of the Moon-GNSS receiver.

The most traditional C/N0 estimation technique is implemented based on the Narrowband and the Wideband Power Ratio (NWPR), which works just perfectly for the legacy GPS LI C/A receiver. With the advent of new modernized GNSS signals from different systems, some basic signal characteristics of these signals have also changed in such a way that they might no longer enjoy the similar C/N0 estimation performance that NWPR-based C/N0 estimation does for GPS LI C/A signal. For example, in case of BeiDou B1I signal, the presence of an extra tier of modulation (i.e., Neumann-Hoffman code) for Dl signal, and the higher data bit rate in D2 signal may deteriorate the performance of NWPR-based C/No estimation technique. In view of this particular issue, two noise-estimation based C/N0 estimation techniques, namely Signal-to-Noise Power Ratio (SNPR) and Signal-to-Noise Variance Ratio (SNVR), are implemented along with the traditional NWPR-based C/N technique for four different GNSS signals in L1/E1/B1 bands. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of these three C/N0 estimation techniques via Matlab-based signal simulations and also via hardware signal simulator and a software-defined multi-GNSS receiver. The simulation results show that the SNPR and SNVR-based C/N0 estimation techniques offer much better estimation performance than the traditional NWPR-based technique in weak signal condition and also with the signals which have relatively higher data bit rate (i.e., BeiDou Bl D2 signal and Galileo El signal). © 2014 IEEE.","BeiDou B1I; Carrier-to-Noise density ratio; Narrow-band Wide-band Power Ratio","Computer software; Global positioning system; Location based services; MATLAB; Radio navigation; Relativity; Signal receivers; Signal to noise ratio; Telecommunication services; BeiDou B1I; Estimation performance; Estimation techniques; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Noise density; Signal characteristic; Signal-to-noise power ratio; Wide-band; C (programming language)",,,,,"Groves, P.D., GPS signal-to-noise measurement in weak signal and high-interference environments, navigation (2005) Journal of the Institute of Navigation, 52 (2), pp. 83-94; Parkinson, B.W., Spilker, J.J., (1996) Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications, pp. 390-395. , American Institute of Aeronautics 1, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW, Washington DC; Nunes, F., Sousa, F., Leitao, J., Innovation-based code discriminator for GPS/galileo BOC signals (2004) IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, 6, pp. 4127-4131; Ramasubramanian, K., Performance bounds for carrier-to-noise ratio estimation in GPS receivers (2006) ION NTM, , USA; Kaplan, E.D., Hegarty, C., (2006) Understanding GPS-Principles and Applications. 2nd Ed, , chapter 5 Artech House Publishers, Boston, USA; Schmid, A., Neubauer, A., Carrier to noise power estimation for enhanced sensitivity galileo/GPS receivers (2005) Vehicular Technology Conference, 4, pp. 2629-2633. , Sweden; Islam, A.K.M.N., Lohan, E.S., Renfors, M., Moment based CNR estimators for BOC/BPSK modulated signal for Galileo/GPS (2008) Proc. of the 5th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication 2008, , Germany; Piny, M., Falletti, E., Fantino, M., Performance evaluation of C/N0 estimators using a real time GNSS software receiver (2008) IEEE 10th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications, pp. 28-31. , Italy; Linty, N., (2010) Codeless Tracking Algorithms for GNSS Software Receivers, , Master Thesis, Facolt' di Ingegneria dell'infromazione, Politecnico di Torino.

Here, we consider instead informal and unobservable networks. The paper explores how hidden informal exchanges can impact upon organisational decision-making and performance, particularly around inter-agency working, as knowledge distributed across organisations and shared between organisations is often shared through informal means and not captured effectively through the formal decision-making processes. Early warnings and weak signals about potential risks and crises are therefore often missed. We consider the implications of these dynamics in terms of crisis avoidance and crisis management. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","control; crisis; informal networks; organisational performance; risk",,,,,,"Ackroyd, S., Thompson, P., (1999) Organizational Misbehaviour, , London, SAGE; Argyris, C., (1990) Overcoming Organizational Defences.

What lies beneath the spate of recent RIS3s, in terms of specialization options as well as of the processes through which the latter were reached, is only now beginning to be examined in depth. Notably, the Commission did not offer a proper blueprint for RIS3-making, but opted instead to suggest a wide range of possible instruments.

Design/methodology/approach – An example of mapping and identifying expectations is presented as a result of a thematic analysis of qualitative interview data, collected from six stakeholder groups of the media industry. Findings – Expectation types and gaps can be identified through the use of systematic expectation mapping, conceptualized in this paper as “expectation management.” Expectation management analyzes expectation types and priorities, and it assists in crafting response strategies. Four types of expectations (must, will, should, and could) were identified in an empirical study of the media industry. Research limitations/implications – As the empirical study focussed on one industry in one country, the findings should be considered an introduction to expectation mapping and expectation management, to be further developed in other settings. Practical implications – Organizations can gain strategic advantages by using expectation management to deepen communication management. New skills and processes may be needed to enable communication professionals to analyze and understand the core level of expectations. Social implications – Expectation management can help organizations respond to current societal pressures and help publics voice their concerns toward organizations. Originality/value – A new concept with strategic value is presented. The reported study of mapping and identifying expectations helps to clarity and interpret factors that shape stakeholder relationships and satisfaction on a deeper level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Expectation management; Expectations; Public relations theory; Weak signals",,,,,,"Boulding, W., Kalra, A., Staelin, R., Zeithaml, V.A., A dynamic process model of service quality: From expectations to behavioral intentions (1993) Journal of Marketing Research, 30 (1), pp. 7-27; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Brønn, P.S., Adapting the PZB service quality model to reputation risk analysis and the implications for CSR communication (2012) Journal of Communication Management, 16 (1), pp. 77-91; Burgoon, J.K., Interpersonal expectations, expectancy violations, and emotional communication (1993) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 12 (1-2), pp. 30-48; Chung, J.Y., Examining the legitimacy gap in issues management applying expectancy violation theory (2009) Proceedings of the 12th annual International Public Relations Research Conference, pp. 101-119. , Yamamura, K.

Due to the weak signal strength of navigation signals, these applications are easily threatened by interference sources. In particular, a serious threat for these systems is represented by the so called in-car jammers, cheap devices able to obscure the navigation signal in a radius of several hundreds of meters. The introduction of standards for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) enables the exchange of data regarding detected interference events which can be used to enhance the awareness of interference sources, thus increasing the reliability of future ITSs. The main idea of this work is to make use of VANETs in order to monitor and locate jammers representing a threat for vehicular commercial applications. In the first part of the paper the analytic description of the jammer localization problem is described. The technique here adopted makes use of Differential Received Signal Strength (DRSS) measurements, which can be used to estimate the jammer position through a centralized maximum likelihood method. The theoretical lower bond on the estimation accuracy is also derived. In the second part of the paper the jammer localization is performed with real measurements. The measurement campaign carried out in the Galileo test range (GATE) in Berchtesgaden (Germany) is described in details, as well as the equipment used during the experiments and the set-up of the scenarios. Finally the results obtained from the post-processing of the measurements are presented.",,"Analytic descriptions; Commercial applications; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Intelligent transport systems (ITSs); Localization problems; Maximum likelihood methods; Received signal strength; Vehicular adhoc network (VANET); Jamming; Navigation; Telecommunication networks; Traffic control; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Global positioning system",,,,,"(2010) Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications: Amendment 6: Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments, , IEEE 802.11p-2010: Jul. 15, DOI: 10.1109/IEEESTD.2010.5514475; Proctor, A.G., (2011) Protecting the UK Infrastructure: A System to Detect GNSS Jamming and Interference, , InsideGNSS September/October; Bauernfeind, R., In-Car Jammer interference detection in automotive GNSS receivers and localization by means of vehicular communication (2011) Integrated and Sustainable Transportation System (FISTS), 2011 IEEE Forum on, pp. 376-381. , vol., no., June 29 2011-July 1; Patwari, N., Locating the nodes (2005) IEEE Signal Processing Mag., 22 (4), pp. 54-69. , July; Thompson, R.J.R., Balaei, A.T., Dempster, A.G., Dilution of precision for GNSS interference localization systems Proceedings of ENC-GNSS, 2009; Lee, J.H., Buehrer, R.M., Location Estimation Using Differential RSS with Spatially Correlated Shadowing (2009) Global Telecommunications Conference, 2009.

In the meantime, the emergence of network coding has brought about great promises for multicast in communication networks where intermediate nodes are allowed to process independent incoming information flows. Little is known about network coding for unicast, however. The objective of this paper is thus to depart from multicast scenarios and shed light on several possible unicast scenarios to which network coding may be applied in a WiFi hotspot in order to obtain communication benefits such as throughput gain, fairness, and reduced protocol complexity. We identify five representative scenarios in which network coding may be used to benefit unicasting in a WiFi hotspot. Several open research issues and practical challenges related to each scenario are discussed individually. To illustrate the benefits of network coding for unicast in a WiFi hotspot, we propose and implement iCORE: The interface COoperation Repeater-aided network coding Engine. iCORE is a practical system in which multi-channel multi-radio repeaters are used to relay unicast traffic for those terminals sitting far away from an access point and suffering from weak signals at a WiFi hotspot. It is based on our last scenario which illustrates the synergy among network coding, opportunistic routing, and interface management. Utilizing idle wireless interfaces and listening to traffic opportunistically, iCORE allows packets to move across the interfaces and to be coded across flows whenever it sees more transmission opportunities. We evaluate iCORE on a four-node chain-like topology testbed implemented using IEEE 802.11b/g radios and compare it to MORE - the state-of-art intra-flow network coding implementation based on opportunistic routing. Our experimental results reveal promising gains in terms of throughput over MORE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Secondly, the move to transcend disciplinary specialisation, via inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary approaches is strengthening. Thirdly, at a higher order theoretical level, these developments are explicitly theorized in the discourses associated with postformal reasoning, integral theory and planetary consciousness. In spite of all these developments in other disciplines and knowledge fields, the institution of mass public education, with its underpinning industrial worldview, has been pretty static since its inception two hundred years ago. Finally, the paper identifies three minor, but significant, waves of evolutionary emergence in education over the last hundred years that if articulated and nurtured could strengthen the development of evolutionary pedagogies for the 21st century. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolution of consciousness; Evolutionary pedagogies; Foresight; Futures studies; Integral; Planetary; Postformal; Postformal pedagogies","education; theoretical study",,,,,"Gidley, J., Inayatullah, S., (2002) Youth Futures: Comparative Research and Transformative Visions, , Praeger, Westport, CT; Gidley, J., Bateman, D., Smith, C., (2004) Futures in Education: Principles, Practice and Potential, , Australian Foresight Institute, Melbourne; Freire, P., (1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, , Herder and Herder, New York; Illich, I., (1975) Deschooling Society, , Calder and Boyers, London; Gidley, J., Beyond homogenisation of global education: do alternative pedagogies such as Steiner education have anything to offer an emergent globalis/ing world?

The modernized GPS signals, although more robust than the legacy GPS C/A signal, they still suffer from attenuation and multipath reflection errors. This paper introduces a particle filtering-based tracking algorithm that has the ability to separate the line-of-sight signal from the multipath signals, and track their parameters. The algorithm is designed to exploit the benefits of combining the processing of same-satellite signals when operating in dual or multi-frequency receivers. Same-satellite signals are broadcast on different carrier frequencies from the same satellite. The relationships between the corresponding signals parameters are functions in two factors, which are the relative motion between the GPS satellite and the receiver, and the ionospheric effects on the signals propagation. Those relationships are derived and utilized to increase the tracking robustness. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by examining the multipath detection capability, the tracking of multipath parameters variations, and the tracking accuracy for signals with different carrier to noise rations (C/N 0 ). Several multipath scenarios are conducted in the evaluation. The results verify the ability of the proposed algorithm to mitigate multipath errors under strong and weak signals conditions. The advantage of combining the processing of same-satellite signals is also demonstrated in the results.",,"Carrier frequency; Combined processing; GPS satellites; Ionospheric effects; Line-of-sight; Modernized gPS; Multi frequency; Multipath detection; Multipath error; Multipath parameters; Multipath reflections; Multipath signals; Noise ration; Particle Filtering; Positioning accuracy; Relative motion; Tracking accuracy; Tracking algorithm; Urban areas; Weak signals; Algorithms; Degradation; Multipath propagation; Satellites; Signal filtering and prediction; Global positioning system",,,,,"Parkinson, B., Spilker, J., Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications (1996) AIAA; Fontana, R.D., Stansell, T.A., Cheung, W., The Modernized L2 Civil Signal (2001) GPS World, , September; Fontana, R.D., Cheung, W., Novak, P.M., Stansell, T.A., The New L2 Civil Signal (2001) Proc.

Weak signals are identified from the early 20th century indicating the emergence of new knowledge patterns. These signals have strengthened in the last 40 years. The paper first identifies new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, religion and education. New knowledge patterns are then identified in discourses that traverse disciplinary boundaries through transdisciplinary approaches such as futures studies and planetary/global studies. The paper then discusses evolution of consciousness, identifying research that theorises new ways of thinking as being related to individual psychological development and/or socio-cultural evolution. Finally, evolutionary concepts are discussed that attempt to meta-cohere the new knowledge patterns via the terms postformal, integral and planetary. Notably, academic research on "" futures of thinking,"" "" evolution of consciousness"" and/or "" global mindset change"" has been, until now, largely ignored by mainstream academic discourse on evolution, consciousness and futures studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Adult developmental psychology; Evolution of consciousness; Futures; Integral; Macrohistory; Planetary; Postformal; Transdisciplinarity","academic research; evolution; future prospect; interdisciplinary approach; philosophy; psychology",,,,,"Miller, R., Making connections to the world: some thoughts on holistic curriculum [Electronic version] (2006) Encounter: Education for Meaning and Social Justice, 19 (3); Naisbitt, J., (2006) Mindset: Eleven Ways to Change the Way You See - and Create - The Future, , Collins Business, Harper Collins, New York, NY; László, E., (2006) The Chaos Point: The World at the Crossroads, , Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc., Charlottsville, VA; Gidley, J., An other view of integral futures: de/reconstructing the IF brand (2010) Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning and Futures Studies, 42 (2), pp. 125-133; Hampson, G., Integral futures and futures of integral: an analysis of Richard Slaughter's analysis of Causal Layered Analysis (2010) Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning and Futures Studies, 42 (2), pp. 134-148; Slaughter, R., Introduction: Integral futures methodologies (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 101-108; Hayward, P., Pathways to integral perspectives (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 109-119; Gidley, J., The evolution of consciousness as a planetary imperative: an integration of integral views (2007) Integral Review: A Transdisciplinary and Transcultural Journal for New Thought, Research and Praxis, 5, pp. 4-226; Commons, M.L., Richards, F.A., Organizing components into combination: how stage transition works (2002) Journal of Adult Development, 9 (3), pp. 159-177; Einstein, A., Relativity: The Special and General Theory (Translated Robert W.

Analyzing to what extent a weak signal endures in noisy environments, we identify the underlying mechanisms, and it results a description of how the excitability associated to (non-equilibrium) phase changes and criticality optimizes the processing of the signal. Our setting is a network of integrate-and-fire nodes in which connections are heterogeneous with rapid time-varying intensities mimicking fatigue and potentiation. Emergence then becomes quite robust against wiring topology modification - in fact, we considered from a fully connected network to the Homo sapiens connectome - showing the essential role of synaptic flickering on computations. We also suggest how to experimentally disclose significant changes during actual brain operation. © 2015 Scientific Reports.",,"biological model; brain; computer simulation; human; nervous system function; physiology; time factor; Brain; Computer Simulation; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nervous System Physiological Phenomena; Time Factors",,,,,"Ashby, W.R., (1954) Design for A Brain: The Origin of Adaptive Behavior, , (John Wiley & Sons); Kelso, J.A.S., Scholz, J.P., Schöner, G., Nonequilibrium phase transitions in coordinated biological motion: Critical fluctuations (1986) Physics Letters A, 118, p. 279; Linkenkaer-Hansen, K., Nikouline, V.V., Palva, J.M., Limoniemi, R., Long-range temporal correlations and scaling behaviour in human brain oscillations (2001) J. of Neurosci., 21, p. 1370; Beggs, J.M., Plenz, D., Neuronal avalanches are diverse and precise activity patterns activity patterns that are stable for many hours in cortical slice cultures (2004) J. of Neurosci., 24, p. 5216; Ashwin, P., Timme, M., When instability makes sense (2005) Nature, 436, p. 36; Eguíluz, V.M., Chialvo, D.R., Cecchi, G.A., Baliki, M., Vania Apkarian, A., Scale-free brain functional networks (2005) Phys.

The dynamic detection of health information requires the biomedical amplifier with small volume, low power consumption, multi-function, and high robustness to noise. In this paper, a novel biomedical signal acquisition circuit based on over-sampling and shaped signal technology is proposed, which is able to detect multiple biomedical signals. A novel algorithm based on the shaped signal has been investigated to extract multiple biomedical signals synchronously without complex signal processing scheme. Specifically, electrocardiograph, respiratory, and standard lead dropping signals are detected synchronously by the circuit. Experiments show that the circuit achieves dynamic monitoring of multiple biomedical signals, good manufacturability, low requirement to the device performance and high-noise suppression. The circuit is highly suitable for the biomedical signals as well as other weak signals monitoring. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biomedical signal detection; Multi-function; Over-sampling; Shaped signal","Algorithms; Bioelectric phenomena; Signal detection; Signal sampling; Biomedical signal acquisition; Biomedical signal detection; Complex signal processing; Low-power consumption; Multi-functions; Over sampling; Synchronous acquisition; Ubiquitous health care; Signal processing",,,,,"Barros, A.K., Vigario, R., Jousmaki, V., Extraction of event-related signals from multichannel bioelectrical measurements (2000) IEEE Trans.

However, these concepts often go unused in practice. The 2008/2009 economic crisis provided a strong, ongoing impulse for redesigning such information systems (IS). This article develops six guidelines for the conceptual design of environmental scanning systems that are more applicable than those specified by previous research. We start with literature research, which reveals three gaps in existing approaches. Then we develop design guidelines to fill these gaps with the help of ""modern"" IS. To address the lack of sound requirements analysis, our first design principle proposes 360-degree environmental scanning systems for executives and suggests how to select the most important scanning areas. Three further findings cover weaknesses in the IS model perspective, focusing on more effective implications of weak signals. In terms of method, we propose incorporating scanning results more closely into executives' decision-making processes. Applying the design guidelines at a raw materials and engineering company, we arrive at a prototype we call the ""corporate radar."" It includes an IS-based tree with economic value added at risk on top. The resulting lessons learned help to evaluate our findings and the research method presented here, as well provide concrete starting points for future research. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","""Modern"" information system technology;

The corresponding de novo motif discovery problem in bioinformatics is formulated as pattern discovery from strings, where challenges come from both modeling and optimization, because the short TFBSs are weak signals in massive and noisy experimental data. While genetic algorithms have been widely applied to the problem, recent memetic algorithms (MAs) employing local operators demonstrate the superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose and study various MA components including local operators and models for motif discovery, through the newly established MA framework. The demonstrated optimization and modeling capabilities are analyzed in-depth on real datasets and their noisy versions. Selected optimal MAs show significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in extensive tests including the blind test on the eukaryotic benchmark. This paper serves as the first systematic study of MAs on de novo motif discovery, where important issues are highlighted in the analyses of MA design. The comprehensive component categorization and the MA framework provide a useful platform for future MA developments, especially on the newly emerging chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing data. © 2012 IEEE.","Bioinformatics; evaluation functions; local operators; memetic algorithms; motif discovery; TFBS identification","Blind test; Chromatin immunoprecipitation; Evaluation function; Local operators; Memetic algorithms; Modeling and optimization; Modeling capabilities; Motif discovery; Noisy versions; Pattern discovery; Real data sets; State-of-the-art methods; Systematic study; Transcription factor binding sites; Weak signals; Benchmarking; Binding sites; Optimization; Transcription factors; Bioinformatics",,,,,"Galas, D.J., Schmitz, A., DNAse footprinting: A simple method for the detection of protein-DNA binding specificity (1987) Nucleic Acids Res., 5 (9), pp. 3157-3170. , Sep; Garner, M.M., Revzin, A., A gel electrophoresis method for quantifying the binding of proteins to specific DNA regions: Application to components of the Escherichia coli lactose operon regulatory system (1981) Nucleic Acids Res., 9 (13), pp. 3047-3060. , Jul; Tompa, M., Li, N., Bailey, T.L., Church, G.M., De Moor, B., Eskin, E., Favorov, A.V., Zhu, Z., Assessing computational tools for the discovery of transcription factor binding sites (2005) Nature Biotechnology, 23 (1), pp. 137-144. , DOI 10.1038/nbt1053; Smith, A.D., Sumazin, P., Das, D., Zhang, M.Q., Mining ChIP-chip data for transcription factor and cofactor binding sites (2005) Bioinformatics, 21 (SUPPL. 1), pp. i403-i412. , DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti1043; MacIsaac, K.D., Fraenkel, E., Practical strategies for discovering regulatory DNA sequence motifs (2006) PLoS Comput.

We develop an experimental apparatus composed of a piezoelectric actuator and its controller, and generate a step several microns high mixed with noise to perform a series of psychophysical experiments. Since psychophysical experiments are conducted based on the Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST) method, we produce a PEST program that generates a stimuli sequence based on PEST. The experimental result shows that variation in the difference threshold (Difference Limen; DL) has a local minimum point in the relationship between DL and noise. Therefore, the tactile sensation's just noticeable difference (JND) is decreased by appropriate external noise. Since JND denotes the scale divisions of sensation in the human mind, the present result shows that precise tactile sensations are enhanced by the appropriate external noise. Finally, we introduce a neural network model composed of nonlinear neurons with the bi-stable equilibrium condition to explain this result. Although original sensor data do not represent the morphology of the fine texture, the neural network model extracts the morphology and distinguishes the wave amplitude of the fine texture. © 2011 Springer Science & Business Media BV.","Complex systems; Human sensation; Neural network; Psychophysical experiment; Stochastic resonance; Tactile sensor","Bistables; Difference limen; Difference threshold; Equilibrium conditions; Experimental apparatus; External noise; Human mind; Human sensation; Just-noticeable difference; Local minimum point; Neural network model; Non-linear neurons; Processing method; Psychophysical experiments; Sensor data; Sequential testing; Social robotics; Stochastic resonances; Tactile sensation; Tactile sensors; Wave amplitudes; Weak signals; Color photography; Data processing; Large scale systems; Magnetic resonance; Morphology; Neural networks; Parameter estimation; Piezoelectric actuators; Sensors; Signal processing; Software testing; Textures; Circuit resonance",,,,,"Herrmann, G., Melhuish, C., Towards safety in human robot interaction (2010) Int J Soc Robot, 2, pp. 217-219; Tanaka, M., Lévêque, L., Tagami, H., Kikuchi, K., Chonan, S., The ""haptic finger""-a new device for monitoring skin condition (2003) Skin Res Technol, 9, pp. 131-136; Hosoda, K., Tada, Y., Asada, M., Anthropomorphic robotic soft fingertip with randomly distributed receptors (2006) Robot Auton Syst, 54, pp. 104-109; Shirado, H., Maeno, T., Modeling of human texture perception for tactile displays and sensors (2005) The First Joint Eurohaptics Conference and Symposium on Haptic Interface for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems: 57-58; Moss, F., Wiesenfeld, K., The benefits of background noise (1995) Sci Am, 273 (2), pp. 50-53; Gammaitoni, L., Hänggi, P., Jung, P., Marchesoni, F., Stochastic resonance (1998) Rev Mod Phys, 70 (1), pp. 223-287; Gluckman, B.J., Netoff, T.I., Neel, R.J., Ditto, W.L., Spano, M.L., Schiff, S.J., Stochastic resonance in a neuronal network from mammalian brain (1996) Phys Rev Lett, 77 (19), pp. 4098-4101; Kanamaru, T., Horita, T., Okabe, Y., Stochastic resonance in the Hodgkin-Huxley network (1998) J Phys Soc Jpn, 67 (12), pp. 4058-4063; Chik, D.T.W., Wang, Y., Wang, Z.D., Stochastic resonance in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron in the absence of external noise (2001) Phys Rev, 64. , 021913; Schmid, G., Goychuk, I., Hänggi, P., Stochaerhstic resonance as a collective property of ion channel assemblies (2001) Europhys Lett, 56 (1), pp. 22-28; Sakumaru, Y., Aihara, K., Stochastic resonance and coincidence detection in single neurons (2002) Neural Process Lett, 16 (2002), pp. 235-242; Collins, J.J., Imhoff, T.T., Grigg, P., Noise-mediated enhancements and decrements in human tactile sensation (1997) Phys Rev E, 56 (1), pp. 923-926; Gescheider, G.A., (1997) Psychophysics: The fundamentals, , Lawrence Erlbaum associates; Taylor, M.M., Creelman, C.D., PEST: efficient estimation provability functions (1967) J Acoust Soc Am, 41 (4), pp. 782-787; Ohka, M., Kondo, S., Stochastic resonance aided tactile sensing (2009) Robotica, 27, pp. 633-639; Hodgkin, A.L., Huxley, A.F., A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve (1952) J Physiol, 117, pp. 500-544; Miyaoka, T., Ohka, M., Tactile information processing mechanisms of fine surface texture discrimination in humans: a study with ridge height discrimination tasks (1997) Int, Ergonomics Association 13th Triennial Congress of the IEA, 7, pp. 264-266; Miyaoka, T., Mano, T., Ohka, M., Mechanisms of fine-surface-texture discrimination in human tactile sensation (1999) J Acoust Soc Am, 105 (4), pp. 2485-2492; Miyaoka, T., Measurements of detection thresholds presenting normal and tangential vibrations on human glabrous skin (2004) Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Meeting of the International Society for Psychophysics, 20, pp. 465-470; Miyaoka, T., Mechanoreceptive mechanisms to determine the shape of the detection-threshold curve presenting tangential vibrations on human glabrous skin (2005) Proceedings of the 21st Annual Meeting of the International Society for Psychophysics, 21, pp. 211-216","Ohka, M.; Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan; email: ohka@is.nagoya-u.ac.jp",,,,,,,,18754791,,,,"English","Int.

Focusing on the strength of the signal generated by HRM practices, we develop a framework for contract creation. Specifically, we define and outline how weak signals generate psychological contracts and strong signals develop legally binding contracts. We provide several examples of HRM hiring practices, the weak and strong signals which they emit and the psychological and legal contracts which they create. Our key contribution is to provide a precise model for understanding the distinction between a psychological and legal contract. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Human resource management practices; Legal contracts; Psychological contracts; Signaling theory",,,,,,"Aiman-Smith, L., Bauer, T.N., Cable, D.M., Are you attracted?

Although a rich body of know-ledge exists, concepts are not often used in practice. This article contributes a literature review addressing six findings for ESS design to become more applicable than the state of the art. They are structured by the elements of information systems (IS) design theories. Addressing the lack of a sound requirements analysis, our first finding proposes 360-degree ESS for executives’ “managing a company” task and presents how to select just the most important scanning areas to keep focus. Three other findings cover the IS model perspective focusing on a better “grasp” of weak signals: define concrete indicators and use IT to identify relevant cause-effective-chains, leverage IT to automate dayto- day routines and monitor the variety of indicators’ movements, and—as a fourth finding—leverage expert experience with an impact matrix and translate indicators’ impact into a balanced opportunity-and-threat portfolio. From the methods perspective on ESS, we propose to more closely incorporate scanning results into executives' decision-making process by generating scenarios from a set of environment assumptions as well as to use retrospective controls to continuously update the ESS and collaborate to share the scanning findings day-to-day. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2011.","Balanced chance and risk management; Corporate management; Information and communication technology (ICT); Literature review","Decision making; Imaging systems; Information systems; Risk management; Scanning; Balanced chance and risk managements; Corporate management; Decision making process; Environmental scanning; Information and Communication Technologies; Literature reviews; Managing a companies; Requirements analysis; Sustainable development",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York; Albright, K.S., Environmental scanning: Radar for success (2004) The Information Management Journal, 38 (3), pp. 38-45; Ansoff, H.I., Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-32; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic Issue Management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1 (2), pp. 131-148; Arnott, D., Pervan, G., Eight key issues for the decision support systems discipline (2008) Decision Support Systems, 44 (3), pp. 657-672; Choo, C.W., Information Use and Early Warning Effectiveness: Perspectives and Prospects (2009) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60 (5), pp. 1071-1082; Choudhury, V., Sampler, J.L., Information Specificity and Environmental Scan-ning: An Economic Perspective (1997) MIS Quarterly, 21 (1), pp. 25-53; Ciborra, C., Notes in Improvisation and Time in Organizations.

Yet, the exact implications of complexity science for FS remain somewhat opaque. This paper explicitly sets out the challenges for FS that arise from six complexity science concepts: (1) irreversibility of time (2) path dependence 3) sensitivity to initial conditions (4) emergence and systemness (5) attractor states (6) complex causation. The discussion highlights the implications of these challenges for FS tools such as horizon scanning and weak signals, and sets out the benefits of overcoming the challenges to create an explicitly complexity-orientated FS. The discussion concludes with a set of questions summarising the challenge for FS from complexity science with the aim of stimulating a discussion as to how they can be met. The concluding remarks make some initial suggestions in this regard. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Complexity science; Emergence; Futures Studies; Horizon scanning; Scenario planning; Uncertainty; Weak signals","complexity; future prospect; planning process; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Multi-ontology, sense-making and the emergence of the future (2009) Futures, 41, pp. 279-283; Aiginger, K., The great recession vs. the great depression: stylized facts on siblings that were given different foster parents (2010) Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment e-Journal, 4; Aldred, J., Climate change uncertainty, irreversibility and the precautionary principle (2012) Cambridge Journal of Economics, 36, pp. 1051-1072; Almunia, M., Benetrix, A., Eichengreen, B., O'Rourke, K.H., Rua, G., From great depression to great credit crisis: similarities, differences and lessons (2010) Economic Policy, 25, pp. 219-265; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 28, pp. 28-33; Arthur, W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by small historical events (1989) Economic Journal, 99, pp. 116-131; Arthur, W.B., (2009) The nature of technology: what it is and how it evolves, , Penguin, London; Axtell, R., The complexity of exchange (2005) The Economic Journal, 115, pp. F193-F210; Ayres, R.U., Axtell, R., Foresight as a survival characteristic: when (if ever) does the long view pay?

Standard single marker methods may lack power in selecting informative markers or estimating effects. Most existing methods also typically do not account for nonlinearity. Identifying markers with weak signals and estimating their joint effects among many noninformative markers remains challenging. One potential approach is to group markers based on biological knowledge such as gene structure. If markers in a group tend to have similar effects, proper usage of the group structure could improve power and efficiency in estimation. We propose a two-stage method relating markers to disease risk by taking advantage of known gene-set structures. Imposing a naive Bayes kernel machine (KM) model, we estimate gene-set specific risk models that relate each gene-set to the outcome in stage I. The KM framework efficiently models potentially nonlinear effects of predictors without requiring explicit specification of functional forms. In stage II, we aggregate information across gene-sets via a regularization procedure. Estimation and computational efficiency is further improved with kernel principal component analysis. Asymptotic results for model estimation and gene-set selection are derived and numerical studies suggest that the proposed procedure could outperform existing procedures for constructing genetic risk models. © 2015, American Statistical Association.","Gene-set analysis; Genetic association; Genetic pathways; Kernel machine regression; Kernel PCA; Principal component analysis; Risk prediction",,,,,,"Bach, F.R., Lanckriet, G.R., Jordan, M.I., Multiple Kernel Learning, Conic Duality, and the SMO Algorithm (2004) Proceedings of the Twenty-first International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 6-13. , ACM; Bengio, Y., Delalleau, O., Le Roux, N., Paiement, J., Vincent, P., Ouimet, M., Learning Eigenfunctions Links Spectral Embedding and Kernel PCA (2004) Neural Computation, 16, pp. 2197-2219; Borchers, A., Uibo, R., Gershwin, M., The Geoepidemiology of Type 1 Diabetes (2010) Autoimmunity Reviews, 9, pp. 355-365; Braun, M., (2005) Spectral Properties of the Kernel Matrix and Their Application to Kernel Methods in Machine Learning, , Ph.D. dissertation, University of Bonn; Breiman, L., Spector, P., Submodel Selection and Evaluation in Regression: The x-Random Case (1992) International Statistical Review/Revue Internationale de Statistique, 60, pp. 291-319; Burton, P., Genome-Wide Association Study of 14, 000 Cases of Seven Common Diseases and 3, 000 Shared Controls (2007) Nature, 447, pp. 661-678. , and The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium; Casanova, R., Hsu, F.C., Sink, K.M., Rapp, S.R., Williamson, J.D., Resnick, S.M., Espeland, M.A., Initiative, A.D.N., Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Assessment Using Large-Scale Machine Learning Methods (2013) PloS One, 8, p. 77949; Cassidy, A., Myles, J., van Tongeren, M., Page, R., Liloglou, T., Duffy, S., Field, J., The LLP Risk Model: An Individual Risk Prediction Model for Lung Cancer (2008) British Journal of Cancer, 98, pp. 270-276; Chatterjee, N., Carroll, R., Semiparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation Exploiting Gene-Environment Independence in Case-Control Studies (2005) Biometrika, 92, pp. 399-418; Chen, J., Pee, D., Ayyagari, R., Graubard, B., Schairer, C., Byrne, C., Benichou, J., Gail, M., Projecting Absolute Invasive Breast Cancer Risk in White Women With a Model That Includes Mammographic Density (2006) Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 98, pp. 1215-1226; Cristianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines, , New York: Cambridge University Press; D’Agostino, R., Wolf, P., Belanger, A., Kannel, W., Stroke Risk Profile: Adjustment for Antihypertensive Medication.

Furthermore, sufficient coherent integration can help to separate the line-of-sight (LOS) and non LOS (NLOS) signals-primarily in the Doppler domain-for multipath mitigation. However, extending integration time is limited by the presence of the navigation message data bits. The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation method has been shown as the most effective way to estimate the navigation bit boundary locations (i.e., bit synchronization) and subsequently estimate the data bit values (i.e., bit decoding) in the presence of noise alone. This paper further analyzes the performance of ML estimation method as a function of various other parameters by using the successful synchronization rate (SSR) and successful decoding rate (SDR) as the criteria. The parameters considered include the number of data bits required (i.e., integration time) and the Doppler frequency error, and both are evaluated under different signal strength scenarios. The requirements for bit synchronization are analyzed under three SSRs, which are 85%, 90% and 95%. Results indicate that, under the SSR of 90% and the SDR of 90%, bit synchronization and bit decoding are valid for signal strengths of 15 dB-Hz and 20 dB-Hz respectively, and the Doppler frequency errors should not be larger than 24 Hz and 11 Hz respectively. © 2012 IEEE.","bit decoding; bit sychronization; extended integration; GNSS (GPS) receiver; high sensitivity; standalone; weak signal","Bit synchronization; Coherent integration; Data bits; Decoding rates; Doppler; Doppler frequency; GNSS receivers; GNSS signals; High sensitivity; Integration time; Line-of-sight; ML estimation; Multi-path mitigation; Navigation messages; Number of datum; Requirements analysis; Signal strengths; standalone; Synchronization rate; Weak signals; Decoding; Doppler effect; Estimation; Integration; Location based services; Navigation; Signal receivers; Synchronization; Global positioning system",,,,,"MediaTek, MT3336, MediaTek Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores the grey area that lays between some consolidated analytical concepts, namely: spillovers, corporate responsibility, social cooperation and non-governmental organizations. It is in this grey area that ""social multinationals"" can be placed and examined. Scattered evidence is provided to illustrate the emergence of this relatively new phenomenon. Findings: There are weak signals that the ""social multinational"" is a viable institutional innovation. The economic rationale is mainly represented by what could be defined in Smithian terms as the ""selfless component of self-interest"", combined with the ex ante and ex post advantages associated to multinationality. Institutional and technological transformations have created opportunities for the emergence of this phenomenon over the past three decades. However, there is a need for specifically designed policies to reinforce this relatively new trend in international business. Originality/value: The paper proposes a new analytical category and draws insights on its potential implications for welfare, poverty reduction and economic development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cooperatives; Multinational companies; Non-governmental organizations; Social business; Social responsibility; Spillovers",,,,,,"Aldashev, G., Verdier, T., When NGOs go global: Competition on international markets for development donations (2009) Journal of International Economics, 79 (2), pp. 198-210; Andreoni, J., Payne, A., Do government grants to private charities crowd out giving or fund-raising?

Full bit method avoids effects of the data bit modulation thereby preserves a longer coherent integration yet consumes too much time and resources. In this paper, an enhanced full bit method is proposed, which aims at speeding up the full bit acquisition remarkably and maintain the superiority in receiving weak signals. All the acquisitions are based on the constant false alarm rate (CAFR) criteria. However, it is difficult to acquire the theoretical detection probability of the full bit method. Thus, an approach to it is given in this paper, and as a standard compared with the enhanced full bit results. The simulation results show that the new method increases the speed of acquisition by 28% on the average; the detection probability of the new method stay close to the full bit method; when non-coherent integration number equals 40, signals whose C/N 0 (carrier-to-noise ratios) are as low as 19 dB·Hz can be acquired. © 2011 IEEE.","acquisition methods; CAFR; Full bit; weak signal","acquisition methods; CAFR; Carrier to noise ratio; Coherent integration; Constant false alarm rate; Detection probabilities; Intermediate frequencies; Non-coherent; Observation interval; Software GPS receiver; Weak signals; Global positioning system; Signal detection; Signal receivers",,,,,"Van Dierendonck, A.J., GPS Receivers (1996) Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications, 1, pp. 329-407. , Parkinson, B.W. and Spilker, J.J.

A new detection scheme for weak signal acquisition in the presence of data bits is derived from the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) and its performance is evaluated against that of existing techniques using simulations. A new architecture for tracking GPS weak signals is also proposed. The technique uses squaring to remove data bit transitions and block processing to allow long integrations and solve for loop stability problems. Performance of the proposed tracking scheme is evaluated using both software and hardware simulations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is also shown by tracking GPS weak signals in several indoor environments under dynamic conditions, where the signal power levels falls below 10 dB-Hz on several occasions. It is shown that the proposed tracking technique is able to quickly recover from deep power fades and provide accurate Doppler estimates in signal degraded environments.",,"Block processing; Data bits; Detection scheme; Doppler; Dynamic condition; Generalized likelihood-ratio tests; Hardware simulation; Indoor environment; Loop stability; Non-coherent; Power fade; Signal power levels; Tracking scheme; Tracking techniques; Weak signals; Algorithms; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Tracking (position); Global positioning system",,,,,"Borio, D., Lachapelle, G., A non-coherent architecture for GNSS digital tracking loops (2009) Annals of Telecommunications, 64 (9-10), pp. 601-614; Borio, D., Sokolova, N., Lachapelle, G., Memory Discriminators for Non-Coherent Integration in GNSS Tracking Loops (2009) Proceedings of the European Navigation Conference,, Naples, Italy; Borio, D., (2008) A Statistical Theory for GNSS Signal Acquisition, , Doctoral Thesis, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino; Borio, D., (2010) GNSS Receiver Design, ENGO 638 Course Notes, , Department of Geomatics Engineering, University of Calgary, Canada; Corazza, G.E., Pedone, R., Generalized and Average Likelihood Ratio Testing for Post Detection Integration (2007) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 55 (11), pp. 2159-2171; Graas, V.F., Soloviev, A., Haag, U.D.M., Gunawardena, S., Braasch, M., Comparison of Two Approaches for GNSS Receiver Algorithms: Batch Processing and Sequential Processing Considerations (2005) Proceedings of the ION-GNSS,, Long Beach, CA, pp. 200-211; John, G.P., Manolakis, K.D., (1996) Digital Signal Processing: Principles, Algorithms and Applications, , Prentice-Hall Publications, New Jersy, US; Kaplan, E.D., Hegarty, C., (2006) Understanding GPS Principles and Applications, , Artech House, Boston; Kay, S.M., (1998) Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing, 2. , Detection Theory, Prentice-Hall, Inc, New Jersey; Lyons, R.G., (2004) Understanding Digital Signal Processing, , Prentice Hall; O'Driscoll, C., (2007) Performance Analysis of the Parallel Acquisition of Weak GPS Signals, , Phd Thesis, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The National University of Ireland; Satyanarayana, S., Borio, D., Lachapelle, G., Power Levels and Second Order Statistics for Indoor Fading Using a Calibrated A-GPS Software Receiver (2010) Proceedings of the ION GNSS, 21-24 Sep, Portland; Satyanarayana, S., (2011) GNSS Channel Characterization and Enhanced Weak Signal Processing, , PhD Thesis, Dept. of Geomatics Engineering, University of Calgary; Shanmugam, S., (2008) New Enhanced Sensitivity Detection Techniques for GPS L1 C/A and Modernized Signal Acquisition, , Technical Report No. No. 20264, Phd Thesis, Department of Geomatics Engineering, University of Calgary, Canada; Soloviev, A., Graas, F.V., Gunawardena, S., Implementation of Deeply Integrated GPS/Low-Cost IMU for Reacquisition and Tracking of Low CNR GPS Signals (2004) Proceedings of the ION-NTM,, San Diego, CA, pp. 923-935; Van Diggelen, F., (2009) A-GPS: Assisted GPS, GNSS, and SBAS, , Artech House; Yang, C., Han, S., Tracking of Weak GPS Signal with BACIX (2007) Proceedings of the ION GNSS, 25-28 Sept, Fort Worth, TX, pp. 2797-2807","Satyanarayana, S.; Position, Location and Navigation (PLAN) Group, Department of Geomatics Engineering, University of CalgaryCanada",,,,"24th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation 2011, ION GNSS 2011","19 September 2011 through 23 September 2011","Portland, OR",89839,,9781618394750,,,"English","Int.

Previous research has shown that weak signals can be detected by a chaotic system. Many researchers use the Lyapunov exponent to flag the detection of a chaotic state, but our research shows that the Lyapunov exponent follows statistical characteristics, and therefore more factors should be considered in flagging chaotic weak signals. Here, we analyze the statistical characteristics inherent in the Lyapunov exponent calculation steps, and build up a statistical model for different chaotic states based on simulation data. Furthermore, we provide expressions for false-alarm and detection probabilities, selection of driving force threshold and detection of signal-noise-ratio. Finally, we summarize the method of signal amplitude estimation. Our research indicates that the performance of the detection system is related to sampling times and intervals, in accord with the theory of statistical signal detection. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","chaos; Duffing oscillation; Lyapunov exponent; statistical signal process; weak signal detection",,,,,,"Birx, D.L., Pipenberg, S.J., Chaotic oscillators and complex mapping feed forward networks (CMFFNs) for signal detection in noisy environments (1992) International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 881-888. , New York: IEEE Neutral Networks Council; Haykin, S., Xiao, B.L., Detection of signals in chaos (1995) Proc IEEE, 83, pp. 95-122; Leung, H., Huang, X., Parameter estimation in chaotic noise (1996) IEEE Trans Signal Process, 44, pp. 2456-2463; Kennedy, M.P., Kolumban, G., Digital communications using chaos (2000) Signal Process, 80, pp. 1307-1320; Short, K.M., Signal extraction from chaotic communication (1997) Int J Bifurcation Chaos, 7, pp. 1579-1597; Wang, G., Lin, J., Chen, X., The application of chaotic oscillators to weak signal detection (1999) IEEE Trans Ind Electron, 46, pp. 440-444; Wang, G., Zheng, W., He, S., Estimation of amplitude and phase of a weak signal by using the property of sensitive dependence on initial conditions of a nonlinear oscillator (2002) Signal Process, 82, pp. 103-115; Wang, F.P., Guo, J.B., Wang, Z.J., Harmonic signal extraction from strong chaotic interference (in Chinese) (2001) Acta Phys Sinica, 50, pp. 1019-1023; Li, Y., Xu, K., Yang, B.J., Analysis of the geometric characteristic quantity of the periodic solutions of the chaotic oscillator system and the quantitative detection of weak periodic signal (in Chinese) (2008) Acta Phys Sinica, 57, pp. 3353-3358; Li, Y., Yang, B.J., Lin, H.B., Simulation and theoretical analysis on detection of the frequency of weak harmonic signals based on a special chaotic system (in Chinese) (2005) Acta Phys Sinica, 54, pp. 1994-1999; Li, Y., Yang, B.J., Shi, Y.W., Chaos-based weak sinusoidal signal detection approach under colored noise background (in Chinese) (2003) Acta Phys Sinica, 52, pp. 526-530; Liu, Q.Z., Song, W.Q., Detection weak period signal using chaotic oscillator (2009) Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2009), pp. 685-692. , Berlin: Springer; Dubuc, B., Quiniou, J.F., Roques-Carmes, C., Evaluating the fractal dimension of profiles (1989) Phys Rev A: At Mol Opt Phys, 39, pp. 1500-1512; Kolmogorov, A.N., New metric invariant of transitive dynamical systems and endomorphisms of lebesgue spaces (1958) Dokl Russ Acad Sci, 119, pp. 861-864; Pecora, L.M., Carroll, T.L., Johnson, G.A., Fundamentals of synchronization in chaotic systems, concepts, and applications (1997) Chaos Interdisciplinary J Nonlinear Sci, 7, pp. 520-543; Zhang, B., Li, Y., Ma, H.T., An algorithm based on Lyapunov exponents to determine the threshold of chaotic detection for weak signal (in Chinese) (2003) Progress Geophys, 4, pp. 748-751; Lu, S., Wang, H.Y., Calculation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent from multivariate data (in Chinese) (2006) Acta Phys Sinica, 55, pp. 572-576; Xu, W., Guo, J.B., Detection of chaotic direct sequence spread spectrum signal based on the largest lyapunov exponent (in Chinese) (2009) J Appl Sci, 27, pp. 111-116; Zhang, B., Li, Y., Lu, J., Study of the Lyapunov characteristic exponents used as the criteria for chaos (in Chinese) (2004) J Jilin University, 22, pp. 111-114. , (Inf Sci Ed); Moon, F.C., Holmes, P.J., A magnetoelastic strange attractor (1979) J Sound Vib, 65, pp. 275-296; Wang, G.Y., Chen, D.J., Lin, J.Y., The statistical characteristics of weak signal detection based on Duffing oscillator (in Chinese) (1998) Acta Electronica Sinica, 10, pp. 38-44; Grassberger, P., Procaccia, I., Characterization of strange attractor (1983) Phys Rev Lett, 50, pp. 346-349; Wolf, A., Swift, J.B., Swinney, H.L., Determining Lyapunov exponents from a time series (1985) Physica D, 16, pp. 285-317; Rosenstein, M.T., Collins, J.J., de Luca, C.J., A practical method for calculating largest Lyapunov exponents from small data sets (1993) Physica D, 65, pp. 117-134; Liu, W.J., (2005) Probability and Mathematics Statistic, p. 82. , Beijing: Tsinghua University Press; Neyman, J., Pearson, E.S., On the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses (1933) Philos Trans R Soc London, Ser A, 231, pp. 289-337","Jin, T.; School of Electronic Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing 100191, China; email: jintian@buaa.edu.cn",,,,,,,,1674733X,,,,"English","Sci.

This paper introduces the Duffing oscillator weak signal detection method for the downhole acoustic telemetry systems. First, by solving the Duffing equation, analyzed the dynamics characteristic of Duffing oscillator and weak signal detection principle; and then on this basis, built Duffing oscillator circuit based on the Duffing equation, by circuit simulation to study the Duffing circuit sensitive to different initial parameters, conducted a detailed analysis for how the different parameters impacted the system statuses and the low-pass filter with simplicity and availability was proposed for signal demodulation. The results show that the method could effectively detect the weak changes of input signal and suppress strong noise; it is feasible, advanced and practical used for downhole acoustic telemetry system. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Downhole acoustic telemetry system; Downhole communication; Duffing chaos circuit simulation; Duffing oscillator; Weak signal detection","Acoustic telemetry systems; Downholes; Duffing chaos circuit simulation; Duffing oscillator; Weak signal detection; Circuit simulation; Low pass filters; Oscillators (electronic); Oscillators (mechanical); Telemetering; Telemetering equipment; Signal detection",,,,,"Shah, V., Gardner, W., Johnson, D.H., Sinanovic, S., ""Design Considerations for a New High Data Rate LWD Acoustic Telemetry System,"" [R] (2004) SPE 88636, pp. 1-7; Gao, L., Gardner, W., Robbins, C., Memarzadeh, M., Johnson, D., Limits on Data Communication Along the Drillstring Using Acoustic Waves,"" [R] (2005) SPE 95490, pp. 1-6; Jinzhan, G., Weak Signal Detection"" [M], , Tsinghua University Press, in Chinese; Wang, G.D., Chen, D.J., Lin, J.Y., Chen, X., The application of chaotic oscillators to weak signal detection"" [J] (1999) IEEE Transactions On Industrial Electronics, 46 (2), pp. 440-444; Wang, G.Y., Zheng, W., He, S.L., Estimation of amplitude and phase of a weak signal by using the property of sensitive dependence of initial conditions of a nonlinear oscillator"" [J] (2002) Signal Processing, 82 (1), pp. 103-115; Yongsheng, W., Zicai, X., Jin, S., Hongda, F., Circuit Simulation of Duffing chaotic system""[J] (2008) Circuits and Systems, 13 (1), pp. 132-135. , in Chinese; Birx, D.L., (1992) Chaotic Oscillators and CMFFNS to Signal Detection In Noise Environments, 2, pp. 881-888. , IEEE International joint conference on neural networks; Zhihong, Y., Qiong-hui, Y., Unified chaos and its control system EWB design and simulation"" [J] (2005) Circuits and Systems, 10 (2), pp. 45-47. , in Chinese; Li, L., Jun, S., Weak signal detection method study based on Chaotic oscillator"" [J] Journal of Shenyang Agricultural University, 536 (6), pp. 667-668. , 200, in Chinese; Zhiqi, L., Jianjun, L., Li, H., Dapeng, T., (2006) Proteus Based Microcontroller Visualization Software and Hardware Simulation""[M], , Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Press in Chinese","Xuanchao, L.; School of Electronic Engineering, Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China; email: xcliu@xsyu.edu.cn",,,,,,,,1796203X,,,,"English","J.

The first one pursues the opening and specialization characterizing the long-term evolution of the last 50 years of most French agricultural regions, while the second assumes a shift, already perceptible through weak signals, towards more autonomy at the farm and regional scales, a reconnection of crop and livestock farming and a more frugal human diet. A procedure is proposed to translate these qualitative narratives into a quantitative description of the corresponding nutrient fluxes using the GRAFS (Generalized Representation of Agro-Food Systems) methodology, thus allowing a comprehensive exploration of the agronomical and environmental performance of these two scenarios. The results show that the pursuit of the opening and specialization of French agriculture, even complying with regulations regarding reasoned fertilization, would result in considerable environmental burdens namely in terms of water pollution. The scenario generalizing organic farming practices, reconnection of crop and livestock farming systems and a demitarian human diet makes it possible to meet the future national food demand while still exporting significant amounts of cereals to the international market and ensuring better groundwater quality in most French regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural specialization; Agro-food system; Demitarian diet; GRAFS; Organic farming; Prospective scenarios","Crops; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Groundwater; International trade; Water pollution; Water quality; Agricultural specialization; Agro foods; GRAFS; Organic farming; Prospective scenarios; Long Term Evolution (LTE); ground water; autonomy; cereal; cropping practice; diet; livestock farming; organic farming; scenario analysis; agricultural procedures; agro food system; agronomy; Article; cereal; controlled study; crop production; fertilization; food availability; food industry; France; livestock; nonhuman; organic farming; priority journal; prospective study; water pollution; water quality; France",,,,,"Anglade, J., Billen, G., Makridis, T., Garnier, J., Puech, T., et Tittel, C., Nitrogen soil surface balance of organic vs conventional cash crop farming in the Seine watershed (2015) Agric.

In this present study, five ancient silver alloy coins (225 BCE-244 CE) were used as test vehicles to measure their immediate surface microchemistry and evaluate the appropriateness and limitations of High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (HS-LEIS, 0.3 nm depth analysis), High Resolution-X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HR-XPS, 1-3 nm depth analysis) and High Resolution-Raman Spectroscopy (HR-Raman, ∼1000 nm depth analysis). Additional information about the deeper corrosion layers, up to ∼300-1000 nm, was provided by dynamic HS-LEIS and HR-Raman spectroscopy. While not archeologically significant, the use of these coins of small commercial value provides data that is more representative of the weaker signals typically obtained from ancient corroded objects, which can be in stark contrast to pristine data often obtained from carefully prepared alloys of known composition. The oldest coins, from 225 to 214 BCE, possessed an outermost surface layer containing Cu 2 O, Na, Al, Pb, and adsorbed hydrocarbons, while the more recent coins, from 98 to 244 CE, contained Cu 2 O, Ag, N, F, Na, Al, S, Cl, and adsorbed hydrocarbons in similar corresponding surface layers. It thus appears that alloying with copper, even in small amounts, leads to the formation of an outer Cu 2 O layer. Depth profiling revealed the presence of K, Na, Cl, and S as key corrosion components for both sets of coins with S, most likely as Ag 2 S, concentrated towards the surface while the Cl, most likely as AgCl, penetrated deeper. Schema to understand the overall chemistry of the corrosion layers present on these silver alloy coins were developed from the equipment limitations encountered and are presented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To do so, we use the concepts of meta-organizations and partial organizations that were developed by Ahrne and Brunsson (2008, 2010). We conduct a case study of the oil and gas sector and show that while literature has expected these devices to retreat due to globalization and weakening of states and collective negotiations, they actually remain a powerful mean of collective action between firms. Notably, firms widely use these devices to deal with CSR and sustainable development issues, in relation with all the different stakeholders. From a strategic standpoint, these collective action devices allow firms to manage reputational effects and weak signals coming from the environment, as well as to neutralize conflicts with stakeholders. From the institutional standpoint, the invention of new organizational forms since the 1960s - business thematic and multi-stakeholder meta-organizations - occurred in a dynamics of institutional complementarity Indeed, these devices rely on one another and complete each other, therefore allowing firms to develop a broad range of collective strategies. © Presses Universitaires de France.","Collective action; Collective strategies; Devices; Meta-organization; Partial organization",,,,,,"Ahrne, G., Brunsson, N., (2008) Meta-organizations, , Cheltenham, Edward Elgar Publishing; Ahrne, G., Brunsson, N., L'organisation en dehors des organisations, ou l'organisation incomplète (2010) Le Libellio d'AEGIS, 6 (1), pp. 36-52; Andolfatto, D., Labbé, D., (2012) Sociologie des Syndicats, , Paris, La Découverte; Aoki, M., (2001) Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis, , Cambridge MA, MIT Press; Astley, G.W., Fombrun, C., Collective strategy: Social ecology of organizational environments (1983) Academy of Management Review, 8 (4), pp. 576-587; Barley, S., Signifying institutions (2010) Management Communication Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 200-206; Baron, D., Integrated strategy: Market and nonmarket components (1995) California Management Review, 37 (2), pp. 47-65; Baron, D., (2010) Business and its Environment, , Upper Saddle River, Prentice-Hall, 6 th ed; Bastianutti, J., Dumez, H., Pourquoi les entreprises sont-elles désormais reconnues comme socialement responsables ?

On the one hand it considers the external approach, that is, the analysis of visible signals linked to the emerging issues that in an early stage are called ""weak signals"". On the other hand, it tries to study emerging issues taking into account their internal motivations. In this case the aim is to value the social, economic or other kind of reasons that are hidden under emerging issues. A post-structuralism perspective (CLA, causal layered analysis) is used to address this objective.This double approach allows to consider emerging issues in a holistic way, taking into account what is visible and what is not so apparent.

The sensor data allow inferring transportation modes as car, bus, walk, and bike. Despite some techniques show improvements in accuracy, researchers constantly deal with issues such as over-segmentation and low precision in trip reporting. Journeys are over-segmented due to the ambiguous situations, for instance: traffic lights, traffic jam, bus stops and weak signal reception. Thereby, current techniques report high misclassification errors. We present a method for detecting changes of transportation mode on a multimodal journey, where the input data regard to the classification of human activities. We use a space transformation for extracting features that identify a transition between two transportation modes. The data are collected from the Google API for Human Activity Classification through a crowdsourcing-based application for smartphones. Results show improvements on precision and accuracy in comparison to initial classification data outcomes. Therefore, our approach reduces the over-segmentation for multimodal journeys. © 2015 IEEE.","activity classification; change mode detection; Segmentation","Application programming interfaces (API); Image segmentation; Information fusion; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Activity classifications; Extracting features; Human activities; Misclassification error; Mode detection; Over segmentation; Space transformations; Transportation mode; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Reddy, S., Mun, M., Burke, J., Estrin, D., Hansen, M., Srivastava, M., Using mobile phones to determine transportation modes (2010) ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks, 6 (2), pp. 1-27. , http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1689239.1689243, Feb; Liao, L., Patterson, D.J., Fox, D., Kautz, H., Learning and inferring transportation routines (2007) Artificial Intelligence, 171 (5-6), pp. 311-331. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0004370207000380, Apr; Zheng, Y., Liu, L., Wang, L., Xie, X., Learning transportation mode from raw GPS data for geographic applications on the web (2008) Proceeding of the 17th International Conference on World Wide Web-WWW '08, (49), p. 247. , http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1367497.1367532; Bolbol, A., Cheng, T., Tsapakis, I., Haworth, J., Inferring hybrid transportation modes from sparse GPS data using a moving window SVM classification (2012) Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 36 (6), pp. 526-537. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0198971512000543, Nov; Zhang, L., Qiang, M., Yang, G., Mobility transportation mode detection based on trajectory segment (2013) Journal of Computational Information Systems, 8, pp. 3279-3286; Feng, T., Timmermans, H.J., Transportation mode recognition using GPS and accelerometer data (2013) Transportation Research Part C: Emerg-ing Technologies, 37, pp. 118-130. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968090X13002039, Dec; Wang, H., Calabrese, F., Di Lorenzo, G., Ratti, C., Transportation mode inference from anonymized and aggregated mobile phone call detail records (2010) 13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 318-323. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5625188, Sep; Anderson, T., Natcen, V.A., Wolf, J., Geostats, M.L., (2009) National Travel Survey GPS Feasibility Study Final Report, , National Centre for Social Reseach, Tech.

We propose a random-effects mixture model coupled with a Dirichlet-process prior for clustering. The mixture model formulation allows for probabilistic cluster assignments. The random-effects formulation allows for attributing the total variability in the data to the sources that are consistent with the experimental design, particularly when the noise level is high and the temporal dependence is not strong. The Dirichlet-process prior induces a prior distribution on partitions and helps to estimate the number of clusters (or mixture components) from the data. We further tackle two challenges associated with Dirichlet-process prior-based methods. One is efficient sampling. We develop a novel Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure to sample the partitions. The other is efficient use of the MCMC samples in forming clusters.We propose a two-step procedure for posterior inference, which involves resampling and relabeling, to estimate the posterior allocation probability matrix. This matrix can be directly used in cluster assignments, while describing the uncertainty in clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and sampling procedure through simulated data. Applying our method to a real data set collected from Drosophila adult muscle cells after five-minute Notch activation, we identify 14 clusters of different transcriptional responses among 163 differentially expressed genes, which provides novel insights into underlying transcriptional mechanisms in the Notch signaling pathway. The algorithm developed here is implemented in the R package DIRECT, available on CRAN. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2013.","Bayesian clustering; Chinese restaurant process; Dirichlet process; Label switching; Markov-chain monte carlo (mcmc); Microarray gene expression; Mixture model; Multivariate analysis; Random effects; Time series",,,,,,"Antoniak, C.E., Mixtures of Dirichlet processes with applications to Bayesian nonparametric problems (1974) Ann.

However, as bandwidth used for next generation cellular network keeps moving to higher frequency spectrum, weaker signals for indoor cellular users has attracted additional attention. Femtocell technology has become an emerging solution and has recently been extensively studied for indoor cellular signal coverage. But, it is important to categorically analyze pros and cons of incorporating new techniques in order to judge their compatibility with existing wireless networks. The existing cellular network primarily comprises of two elements; macro base stations (M-BSs) and macro user equipments (M-UEs). In this paper, we study the effect of large scale femtocell deployment on M - UEs. Femtocells devices are designed to be deployed by individual end user, thus distribution pattern of femtocell network is not controllable. However, due to the fact that cellular signal strength decreases as the distance to the M - BS increases, it is envisioned that more femtocell devices would be installed at the edge of macrocell than the center area. Before formation of large scale femtocell, it is meaningful to simulate this deployment scenario and discover the impacts on M-UEs. We utilize a Reverse Gaussian distribution to simulate the deployment of femtocells. Then, we provide a mathematical formulation of the interference caused by femtocells on M-UEs. Extensive simulations are also performed to indicate that the results of our mathematical analysis provide an excellent guideline for interference management in future large scale femtocell deployment. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Deployment scenarios; Distribution patterns; Extensive simulations; Higher frequencies; Interference management; Mathematical analysis; Mathematical formulation; Next generation cellular networks; Next generation networks; Femtocell",,,,,"Mansfield, G., Femtocells in the us market-business drivers and consumer propositions Femtocells Europe 2008.

We propose a hierarchical partitioning of the graph that groups the activated vertices into few partitions, so that a top-down sensing procedure can identify these partitions, and hence the activations, using few measurements. By exploiting the cluster structure, we are able to provide localization guarantees at weaker signal-to-noise ratios than in the unstructured setting. We complement this performance guarantee with an information-theoretic lower bound, providing a necessary signal-to-noise ratio for any algorithm to successfully localize the cluster.

Then, the wavelet packet entropy of each reconstructed signal was calculated. Finally, the reconstructed signal with minimum wavelet packet entropy was selected to detect the ship shaft-rate electric signal by sliding power spectrum algorithm.

It has traditionally been tackled using correlation-based techniques. However, correlation-based detection is not the optimum choice either when the host media doesn't follow a Gaussian distribution or when the watermark is not embedded in the host media in an additive way. This paper addresses the problem of DCT (discrete cosine transform) domain multiplicative watermark detection for digital images. First, generalized Gaussian distributions are applied to statistically model the AC (alternative current) DCT coefficients of the original image. Then, the imperceptibility constraint of watermarking is exploited, and watermark detection is formulated as the problem of weak signal detection in non-Gaussian noise. A binary hypothesis test concerning whether or not an image is watermarked is established, and an optimum detection structure for blind watermark detection is derived. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the new detector in the case that the embedding strengths are unknown to the detector.

Different from existing research efforts that either only deal with undirected graphs or circumvent directionality by means of symmetrization, we propose a novel random walk approach on directed graphs using absorbing Markov chains, which can be regarded as maximizing the accumulated expected number of visits from the unlabeled transient states. Our algorithm is simple, easy to implement, and works with large-scale graphs on binary, multiclass, and multi-label prediction problems. Moreover, it is capable of preserving the graph structure even when the input graph is sparse and changes over time, as well as retaining weak signals presented in the directed edges. We present its intimate connections to a number of existing methods, including graph kernels, graph Laplacian based methods, and spanning forest of graphs. Its computational complexity and the generalization error are also studied. Empirically, our algorithm is evaluated on a wide range of applications, where it has shown to perform competitively comparing to a suite of state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm is shown to work exceptionally well with large sparse directed graphs with e.g., millions of nodes and tens of millions of edges, where it significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. In the dynamic graph setting involving insertion or deletion of nodes and edge-weight changes over time, it also allows efficient online updates that produce the same results as of the batch update counterparts. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","absorbing Markov chain; Random walks on directed graphs; transduction generalization error; transductive learning","Bacteriophages; Chains; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Laplace equation; Laplace transforms; Markov processes; Absorbing Markov chain; Algorithm design and analysis; Generalization Error; Kernel; Prediction algorithms; Random Walk; Symmetric matrices; Transductive learning; Directed graphs",,,,,"Hoover, A., Kouznetsova, V., Goldbaum, M., Locating blood vessels in retinal images by piecewise threshold probing of a matched filter response (2000) IEEE Trans.

The quantitative studies of PVSs are meaningful but usually difficult, due to their thin and weak signals and also background noise in the 7 T brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). To clearly distinguish the PVSs in the 7 T MRI, we propose a novel PVS enhancement method based on the Haar transform of non-local cubes. Specifically, we extract a certain number of cubes from a small neighbor to form a cube group, and then perform Haar transform on each cube group. The Haar transform coefficients are processed using a nonlinear function to amplify the weak signals relevant to the PVSs and to suppress the noise. The enhanced image is reconstructed using the inverse Haar transform of the processed coefficients. Finally, we perform a block-matching 4D filtering on the enhanced image to further remove any remaining noise, and thus obtain an enhanced and denoised 7 T MRI for PVS segmentation. We apply two existing methods to complete PVS segmentation, i.e., (1) vesselness-Thresholding and (2) random forest classification. The experimental results show that the PVS segmentation performances can be significantly improved by using the enhanced and denoised 7 T MRI. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"algorithm; brain; diagnostic imaging; human; image enhancement; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; reproducibility; three dimensional imaging; vascularization; Algorithms; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,"Iliff, J.J., Cerebral arterial pulsation drives paravascular CSF-interstitial fluid exchange in the murine brain (2013) J.

The results reached by single UWB sensors for such applications have shown that they are able to detect and track a person very well in a single person scenario. However, in multiple moving person scenarios, the ability of a single UWB sensor to detect several persons is usually significantly reduced. This is caused by a mutual shielding among people. In this paper, we will deal with the mutual shielding effect and its impacts, as well as with the methods of improving multiple moving person tracking by UWB radars. Firstly, we will provide a comprehensive description of the mutual shielding effect. Then, based on its analyses, we will state three complementary approaches created by the authors of this paper to reduce its impacts. They include an enhancement of the low-level echo of the targets, radar antenna array positioning at a convenient height, UWB sensor network application and, finally, their mutual combinations. The properties of those approaches will be demonstrated by two experimental measurements aimed at through wall tracking of two and three people, respectively. The results obtained in the experiments will illustrate the mutual shielding effect and the potential of the methods we have proposed to reduce its impacts. © 2017, The Author(s).","Radar; Sensor; Sensor network; Shielding effect; Tracking; Weak signal enhancement","Antenna arrays; Radar; Radar antennas; Radar shielding; Sensor networks; Sensors; Shielding; Surface discharges; Target tracking; Tracking radar; Critical environment; Mutual shielding effect; Person tracking; Shielding effect; Through walls; Ultra wideband radars; UWB radars; Weak signal enhancements; Ultra-wideband (UWB)",,,,,"Zaikov, E., UWB radar for detection and localization of trapped people (2010) 11th International, Radar Symposium (IRS), , IEEE, Vilnius; Yamauchi, B., Fusing ultra-wideband radar and LIDAR for small UGV navigation in all-weather conditions (2010) Int.

The DPCAs of FM and V that are represented by the classical control theory as an integral control present limitations in the accuracy of signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) estimates in weak-signal environments. Furthermore, in this work the development of DPCA-PID-FM and DPCA-PID-V based on PID schemes originated as DPCA-FM and DPCA-V, respectively, has been conducted to overcome the SNIR estimation limitation. The main results have shown that DPCA-FM reaches convergence with a lower number of iterations than DPCA-V for situations of a good SNIR. However, under weak-signal scenarios, DPCA-V exhibits a smaller discrepancy from the optimum power vector solution and better convergence than DPCA-FM. Also, the proportional and differential actions taken in DPCA-V to originate DPCA-PID-V do not present a noticeable impact on the tendency and the velocity of the convergence compared with DPCA-V. On the other hand, DPCA-PID-FM changes the trend in convergence from DPCA-FM. Finally, the increase in channel error estimation causes an error of convergence for all DPCAs studied in this work. The main advantage of DPCAs based on PID is the possibility of utilizing adaptive tuning procedures to tune the PID gains. © 2016 Optical Society of America.","Distributed power control algorithms; Optical networks; Proportional-integrative-derivative","Adaptive optics; Algorithms; Digital radio; Fiber optic networks; Next generation networks; Passive optical networks; Power control; Signal to noise ratio; Two term control systems; Adaptive tuning; Classical control theory; Distributed power control algorithms; Integral control; Number of iterations; Power allocations; Proportional integral derivatives; Signal to noise plus interference ratio; Proportional control systems",,,,,"Song, H., Kim, B.W., Mukherjee, B., Long-reach optical access networks: A survey of research challenges, demonstrations, and bandwidth assignment mechanisms (2010) IEEE Commun.

RTI Foresight practitioners need to complement their well developed set of technology oriented methods with equally sophisticated approaches tackling societal aspects of innovation. In this paper we aim to make a contribution to this requirement. Building on user innovation theory we argue that demand oriented RTI Foresight needs to systematically integrate voices and hypotheses from the fringes of the innovation system. In order to develop a sound approach for this we set out from well established Foresight theory on ""weak signals"" and ""cognitive biases"". Adopting a constructivist stance towards such signals leads us to the need to set up a socially robust, diverse discourse on ""seeds of change hypotheses"". We then outline a practical implementation of such a discourse in the context of the recent Foresight process of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany. We describe and discuss the experience of this Foresight process and suggest avenues for further development of the approach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive biases; Demand oriented RTI policy; Innovation policy; Lead user theory; Perception filters; Seeds of change; Weak signals","innovation; research; technology policy; theory; Germany",,,,,"Aichholzer, G., The Austrian foresight programme: organisation and expert profile (2001) International Journal of Technology Management, 21 (7-8), pp. 739-755; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, XVIII, pp. 21-33; Bijker, W.E., Law, J., (1997) Shaping technology/building society.

Earthquakes occur infrequently in long-duration data and may produce weak signals, which are challenging to detect while limiting the number of false discoveries. Earthquake detection based on waveform similarity has demonstrated success in detecting weak signals from small events, but existing techniques either require prior knowledge of the event waveform or have poor scaling properties that limit use to small data sets. In this paper, we describe ongoing research into the use of similarity search for large-scale earthquake detection.We describe Fingerprint and Similarity Thresholding (FAST), a new earthquake detection method that leverages locality-sensitive hashing to enable waveformsimilarity-based earthquake detection in long-duration continuous seismic data.We demonstrate the detection capability of FAST and compare different fingerprinting schemes by performing numerical experiments on test data, with an emphasis on false alarm reduction. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Data mining; Earthquake detection; Locality-sensitive hashing; Signal processing; Similarity search; Template matching; Time series","Data mining; Earthquakes; Fire fighting equipment; Geophysics; Numerical methods; Seismology; Signal processing; Template matching; Time series; Detection capability; Earthquake detection; False alarm reductions; Fingerprinting schemes; Large-scale earthquakes; Locality sensitive hashing; Numerical experiments; Similarity search; Signal detection",,,,,"Allen, R., Automatic phase pickers: Their present use and future prospects (1982) Bull.

Box 16500, Aalto, FI 00076, Finland","Growing flexibility in work arrangements, particularly in the knowledge industries, and the ensuing possibilities for teleworking are challenging the traditional ways of conceptualizing and designing public spaces and public services. As an example of this development, public and university libraries are studied from the point of view of teleworking. Although work still only accounts for a small amount of the activities that take place in libraries, its transformations can be seen as a 'weak signal' of newly emerging spatial arrangements. In addition to the home and workplace, teleworkers are using a network of public, semi-public and private spaces (so-called third places) for different types of working. The research used the concept ""spatial portfolio"" to address this phenomenon of spatial modalities. The new role of public libraries within this context is discussed. In addition to their traditional functions of lending books and providing spaces for reading newspapers and magazines, libraries are now becoming more multifunctional, providing space for different activities, including work. This new phenomenon has been studied empirically by conducting a qualitative interview and observing teleworkers in two public libraries and one university library in the City of Helsinki, Finland. The objective was to find and analyze different profiles of workers in libraries, thus providing input for future planning and design of these spaces, as well as the urban fabric around them. The results show that a considerable range of activities within research and education, art and culture, information technology, business and finance, and social services and government are performed in the libraries, all of which are in part supported by the new concepts and policies of the city. Libraries can be seen as 'transitory workspaces' where people work at least a couple of hours per week and for different reasons such as free wifi connection and location. Also, libraries might be considered 'spatial incubators' or rather places able to attract people who start up their own activities. These concepts contribute to define a new way of appropriating libraries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,"Aabø, S., Audunson, R., Use of library space and the library as place (2012) Library and Information Science Research, 34, pp. 138-149; Appelbaum, E., Batt, R., (1994) The new American workplace: Transforming work systems in the United States, , Cornell University Press, New York, NY; Augé, M., (1995) Non-places: Introduction to an anthropology of super modernity, , Verso, London, UK; (2008) Augmented urban spaces, , Ashgate Publishing Company, Burlington, VT, A.

A novel signal processing method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network is proposed and applied in the field of biological signal processing (left and right hands move imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signal). Firstly, EMD is used to decompose EEG signal. Secondly, the major intrinsic mode function components are extracted and their mean absolute values are calculated as the features. Finally, LVQ is used to finish the classification task. Then the results are compared with the support vector machine and error back propagation neural network classification algorithms. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy rate of the proposed algorithm reaches 87%. Compared to the other two contrast algorithms, the new algorithm has better performance in the specific signal processing field and thus has high reference and research value.","Brain-computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network",,,,,,"Wolpaw, J.R., Birbaumer, N., McFarland, D.J., Brain-computer interface for communication and control (2002) Clinical Neurophysiology, 113 (6), pp. 767-791; Hu, J., Xiao, D., Mu, Z., Application of entropy in motor image EEG classification (2009) International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications, 3 (2), pp. 83-90; Khalilil, Z., Moradi, M.H., Emotion recognition system using brain and peripheral signals: Using correlation dimension to improve the results of EEG (2009) International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1571-1575. , Atlanta: IEEE; Zouridakis, G., Patidar, U., Padhye, N.S., Spectral power of brain activity association with emotion: A pilot MEG study (2010) Proceeding of International Conference on Biomagnetism Advances in Biomagnetism, pp. 354-357. , Dubrovnik, Croatia: Springer; Lin, Y.P., Wang, C.H., Jung, T.P., EEG-based emotion recognition in music listening (2010) IEEE Transaction on Biomedical Engineering, 57 (7), pp. 1798-1806; Qin, J.Z., Li, Y.Q., Cichocki, A., ICA and committee machine-based algorithm for cursor control in a BCI system (2005) Springerlink on Advances in Neural Networks, 3496 (1), pp. 973-978; Zhong, M.J., Lotte, F., Girolami, M., Classifying EEG for brain computer interfaces using gaussian processes (2008) Pattern Recognition Letters, 29 (3), pp. 354-359; Park, C., Looney, D., Kidmose, P., Time-frequency analysis of EEG asymmetry using bivariate empirical mode decomposition (2011) IEEE Transaction on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 19 (4), pp. 366-373; Yu, Z., Jin, W., Chen, C., Phase-coded BPSK signal sequence algorithm based on EMD decomposition (2009) Journal of Data Acquisition and Processing, 24 (1), pp. 73-77; Ying, J., Wang, X., Analysis of right and left motor imagery based on empirical mode decomposition (2009) Progress in Biomedical Engineering, 30 (3), pp. 125-130; Khorshidtalab, A., Salami, M.J.E., Hamedi, M., Evaluation of time-domain features for motor imagery movements using FCM and SVM (2012) JCSSE 2012-9th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, pp. 17-22. , Washington: IEEE Computer Society; Duan, M., He, Y., Handwritten alphabet recognition based on LVQ neural network (2010) Journal of Jishou University: Natural Sciences Edition, 31 (2), pp. 41-43; Lloyd, G.R., Brereton, R.G., Faria, R., Learning vector quantization for multiclass classification: Application to characterization of plastics (2007) Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 47 (4), pp. 1553-1563; Ma, L., Zhang, Y., Yu, Y., A hybrid approach for face detection based on modified retinal sampling model (2002) Journal of Data Acquisition and Processing, 17 (1), pp. 37-41","Yu, W.; Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and TechnologyChina",,,"Nanjing University of Aeronautics an Astronautics",,,,,10049037,,SCYCE,,"Chinese","Shu Ju Cai Ji Yu Chu Li",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910080400

Owing to the fact that short-text has inherent defects such as short length, weak signal and less features. It is hard to avoid noise words when doing feature extension which will highly influence the accuracy of classification. In order to solve the above problem, this paper proposes a semantic dictionary method for short-text classification. The method builds a set of domain dictionary by analyzing the specific characteristics in certain field. As each word's weight in the dictionary is designed according to the correlation between the word and the category, classification accuracy has improved to some extent. Then, in order to enhance dictionary vocabulary coverage, association rules are utilized to automatically extend semantic dictionary. Finally, an experiment based on micro-blog data is conducted which shows that the method has a good effect. © 2013 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.","association extension; association rule; semantic dictionary; short-text classification","Accuracy of classifications; Classification accuracy; Micro-blog; Semantic dictionaries; Short text classifications; Statistical features; Weak signals; Association rules; Classification (of information); Text processing; Semantics",,,,,"Sebastiani, F., Machine learning in automated text categorization (2002) ACM Computing Surveys, 34 (1), pp. 1-47; Lewis, D.D., Evaluating and optimizing autonomous text classification systems (1995) Proceedings of SIGIR-95, the 18th ACM International Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 246-254. , Seattle, US; Liu, L.Z., Song, H.T., Feature selection in text categorization (2004) Journal of Computer Engineering, 30 (4), pp. 14-15. , in Chinese; Hu, J.X., Xu, H.B., Wang, B., Short-text clustering based on repeats (2005) Proceedings of the 8th National Joint Science Conference on Linguistics, 85, pp. 64-85. , in Chinese; Hu, J.N., Guo, J., Deng, W.H., Independent semantic feature extraction algorithm based on short text (2007) Journal of Communications, 28 (12), pp. 121-122. , in Chinese; Teng, S.H., (2009) Chinese Word Segmentation and Short Text Classification Techniques Based on CRFs, , Tsinghua University Beijing, China (in Chinese); Fan, X.H., Hu, H.G., Construction of high-quality feature extension mode library for Chinese short-text Information Engineering (ICIE) (2010) 2010 WASE International Conference, 2, pp. 87-90. , IEEE; Ning, Y.H., Fan, X.H., Wu, Y., Short text classification based on domain word ontology (2009) Journal of Computer Science, 36 (3), pp. 142-145. , in Chinese; Lin, X.J., Zhang, M., Bao, X., Short-text classification method based on concept network (2010) Journal of Computer Engineering, 36 (21), pp. 4-6. , in Chinese","Tang, H.-J.; State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China; email: tanghaojin@bupt.edu.cn",,,,,,,,10058885,,JCUPC,,"English","J.

A large variety of algorithms for edge detection already exists but strong image noise is still a challenge. Especially in automatic surveillance and reconnaissance applications with visual-optical, infrared, or SAR imagery, high distance to objects and weak signal-to-noise-ratio are difficult tasks to handle. In this paper, a new approach using Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) is presented, which is a crossover between texture analysis and edge detection. It shows similar results as the Canny edge detector under normal conditions but performs better in presence of noise.

In this paper, the basic principle of the cross-correlation mitigation method based on subspace projection is analyzed and the architecture of suppressor is presented. The corresponding subspace matrix for strong signals can be constructed after the receiver acquiring the code phases, carrier frequencies and data-bit modulation of all strong signals. The projection of the input signals onto the strong signal subspace is the sum of the strong signals and the projection of the noise. Then the projection can be used as an estimate of the strong signals. After subtracting the estimated strong signals from the input signals, the result consists of weak signals, noises and the residue error resulted from the projection operation. Then the acquisition and tracking of the weak signals can be implemented. Two kinds of receiver structure have been proposed for two different scenarios. One is for that the strengths of the strong signals are almost the same. And the other is under that the strengths of the strong signals are largely different. In comparison with the direct interference cancellation technique, only the code phases, carrier frequencies and data-bit modulation of strong signals are required and the method is independent of the carrier phases of the strong signals with complex signal processing. The simulation results indicate that the method can suppress the cross-correlation interference effectively and ADC requires 4-bit quantization at least when the weak signal to the strong signal ratio is -20 dB.",,"Carrier frequency; Complex signal processing; Cross correlations; Detection probabilities; Interference-cancellation technique; Mitigation methods; Receiver structure; Subspace projection; Interference suppression; Modulation; Global positioning system",,,,,"Kapplan, E.D., Hegarty, C.J., (2006) Understanding GPS Principles and Applications, pp. 140-142. , 2nd Edition.

This problem arises in several applications such as detecting anomalies, targets, interference and brain activations. In these applications, the object of interest is described by a large number of features and the ability to detect them using only linear combination of the features (without the need to measure, store or compute the entire feature vector) is desirable. We present a test statistic for subspace detection using compressive samples and demonstrate that the probability of error of the proposed detector decreases exponentially in the number of compressive samples, provided that the energy off the subspace scales as n. Using information-theoretic lower bounds, we demonstrate that no other detector can achieve the same probability of error for weaker signals. Simulation results also indicate that this scaling is near-optimal. © 2012 IEEE.","compressed sensing; subspace detection","Brain activation; Compressive sampling; Compressive sensing; Feature vectors; High-dimensional; Linear combinations; Lower bounds; Object of interests; Probability of errors; Subspace detection; Information theory; Signal detection; Statistical tests; Vectors",,,,,"Stein, D., Beaven, S., Hoff, L., Winter, E., Schaum, A., Stocker, A., Anomaly detection from hyperspectral imagery (2002) IEEE Signal Processing Mag., , Jan; Ardekani, B., Kershaw, J., Kashikura, K., Kanno, I., Activation detection in functional mri using subspace modeling and maximum likelihood estimation (1999) IEEE Trans.

The spectral analysis of these signals in order to detect their components and estimate their parameters is crucial to the biochemical analysis of the samples under examination. This paper presents a novel time frequency representation based on a Gabor filterbank/notch filtering instantaneous frequency estimator, in order to enable the detection of weaker and shorter lived exponentials. Building on prior work involving filterank-based instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation, this new approach is an iterative procedure where a Gabor filterbank is first employed in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the IF of the strongest component present. This component is then notch filtered in order to un-mask weaker components and the procedure repreated. The performance of this method was evaluated using an artificial signal and compared to the short time Fourier transform and the original Gabor filterbank approach. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the new method in uncovering weaker signals and resolving components that are very close to one another in frequency. ©2010 IEEE.","Damped complex exponential; Discrete Fourier analysis; Gabor filter bank; Instantaneous frequency; Spectral estimation","Damped complex exponential; Fourier; Gabor filter banks; Instantaneous frequency; Spectral Estimation; Estimation; Filter banks; Fourier analysis; Fourier transforms; Magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Signal detection; Signal processing; Spectrum analysis; Frequency estimation",,,,,"Nicholson, J.K., Connelly, J., Lindon, J.C., Holmes, E., Metabonomics: A Platform for Studying Drug Toxicity and Gene Function (2002) Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 1, pp. 153-161; Aboutanios, E., Estimation of the Frequency and Decay Factor of a Decaying Exponential in Noise (2010) Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 58 (2), pp. 501-509. , Feb; Hoffman, R.E., Levy, G.C., Modern Methods of NMR Data Processing and Data Evaluation (1991) Progress in NMR Spectroscopy, 23, pp. 211-258; Poullet, J.B., Sima, D.M., Van Huffel, S., MRS signal quantitation: A review of time- And frequency-domain methods (2008) Journal of Magnetic Resonance, 195 (2), pp. 134-144; Sandgren, N., Parametric methods for frequency-selective MR spectroscopy - A review (2004) Journal of Magnetic Resonance, 168, pp. 259-272; Stoica, P., Selen, Y., Sandgren, N., Van Huffel, S., Using prior knowledge in SVD-based parameter estimation for magnetic resonance spectroscopy - The ATP example (2004) Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on, 51 (9), pp. 1568-1578. , Sept; Bertocco, M., Offelli, C., Petri, D., Analysis of Damped Sinusoidal Signals via a Frequency-Domain Interpolation Algorithm (1994) Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on, 43 (2), pp. 245-250. , Apr; Umesh, S., Tufts, D.W., Estimation of parameters of exponentially damped sinusoids using fast maximum likelihood estimation with application to NMR spectroscopy data (1996) Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 44 (9), pp. 2245-2259. , Sep; Quinn, B.G., Hannan, E.J., (2001) The Estimation and Tracking of Frequency, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Cohen, L., (1989) Time-frequency Distributions - A Review, 77, pp. 941-981. , July; Kopsinis, Y., Aboutanios, E., Waters, D.A., McLaughlin, S., Investigation of bat echolocation calls using high resolution spectrogram and instantaneous frequency based analysis Statistical Signal Processing, 2009.

A new two steps acquisition strategy has been proposed in order to mitigate the CAF peak impairments. To achieve better acquisition sensitivity, differentially coherent detection scheme has been considered. When two steps acquisition strategy is employed in the differentially coherent detection scheme, the sign transition problem can be solved and much improved acquisition performance can be obtained specifically in a severe weak signal environment. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed technique has been deeply assessed with simulation analysis. © 2010 IEEE.","Differential detection; GNSS weak signals; Sign transition; Two steps acquisition","Acquisition performance; Bit sign transitions; Cross-ambiguity function; Data channels; Differential detection; Differentially coherent detection; GALILEO; Global navigation satellite systems; Gnss weak signals; Navigation messages; Next generation systems; Pilot channels; Sign transition; Simulation analysis; Transition problems; Two steps acquisitions; Weak signals; Global positioning system; Mobile computing; Navigation; Room and pillar mining; Signal detection; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Signal processing",,,,,"Helstrom, C.W., (1968) Statistical Theory of Signal Detection, , 2nd ed.

In this paper, the merit of NH code is analyzed in detail. Using the I5 component of GPS L5 code, the acquisition method of NH code, which is under normal and weak signal, is analyzed respectively.

In the traditional GPS receivers, the acquisition and tracking of the signals are usually processed by hardware devices, such as the Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). The main disadvantage of ASIC is the high cost of system reconstructions. While a GPS software receiver can perform almost all the operations in a programmable microprocessor, which makes the system more flexible. The specific software correlator inside can greatly accelerate the speed by the bit-wise parallel algorithm which changes large numbers of multiplications into exclusive-or operations. In the acquisition process, the block acquisition method was introduced here to solve the weak signal processing. In the tracking process, the Delay Locked Loop (DLL) and the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) were used for code tracking and carrier tracking respectively. The whole software was developed based on C language under Windows XP environment. Both the simulated GPS data and actual GPS signals were used to verify the performance of the acquisition and tracking processes. The simulation results showed that the software receiver can work properly in real time even in hostile environments. ©2009 IEEE.","Correlator; Global positioning system (GPS); Real-time; Software receiver","Acquisition process; Block acquisition; C language; Carrier tracking; Code tracking; Delay-locked loops; Exclusive-OR; GPS data; GPS receivers; GPS signals; Hardware devices; High costs; Hostile environments; Real-time; Real-time GPS; Simulation result; Software correlator; Software receiver; Software receivers; System reconstruction; Tracking process; Weak signals; Windows XP; Application specific integrated circuits; Computer science; Education computing; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Integrated circuits; Mergers and acquisitions; Parallel algorithms; Phase locked loops; Signal processing; Global positioning system",,,,,"Psiaki, M.L., Real-time generation of bit-wise parallel representations of over-sampled PRN codes (2006) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 5 (3), pp. 487-491. , March; Ledvina, B.M., Psiaki, M.L., Powell, S.P., Kintner, P.M., Bit-wise parallel algorithms for efficient software correlation applied to a GPS software receiver (2004) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 3 (5), pp. 1469-1473. , September; Ledvina, B.M., Psiaki, M.L., Powell, S.P., Kintner, P.M., A 12-channel real-time GPS L1 software receiver (2003) Proc.

It focuses on how it could be possible to analyse emerging trends from actor's strategies toward the future. The main research question is to understand how early signals of new trends appear in a field which is not formally stabilised. We looked at the spontaneously produced categorisations (folksonomy) of 250 start-ups. This corpus is analysed in order to explore how these descriptions identify key future evolutions and how these categorisations of future trends change over time. Our central hypothesis is to consider that early elements of future changes (weak signals) are not given once and for all, but exist within perpetual shifting processes and could be tracked with folksonomic maps. The discussion of the results will suggest that weak signals should not be conceptualised as static entities blessed with some strange power to shape the future but as a set of components, whose main features are their abilities to be constantly rearranged among themselves by the involved actors.","Folksonomy; Future trends; User driven categorisation; Weak signals; Web 2.0","conceptual framework; future prospect; hypothesis testing; information technology; innovation; Internet; signal; technological change; trend analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Ball, P., (2004) Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another, , Arrow Books, London; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: Designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Third American Conference on Information Systems (AIS) Conference, , Paper presented at the Indianapolis USA; Bloor, D., (1976) Knowledge and Social Imagery, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Berlin, B., (2002) Ethnobiological Classification: Principles of Categorization of Plants and Animals in Traditional Societies, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T.J., (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in The Sociology and The History of Technology, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Bijker, W.E., Law, J., (1992) Shaping Technology/building Society, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Coffman, B., (1997) Weak Signal Research, , MG Taylor Corporation; Fitzgerald, M., Tagging tools offer powerful way to organize information (2006) CIO Magazine; Glassey, O., When taxonomy meets folksonomy: Towards hybrid classification of knowledge?

However, there are still some problems remained in conventional LIA, such as high circuit parameter dependence and low application flexibility of analogue LIA, and algorithmic complexity of digital LIA. A new type of LIA detecting circuit is presented in this paper, which combines the advantages of conventional LIA with characteristics of over-sampling and integration of Σ-Δ A/DC. It is theoretically analyzed and proved through experiment that this circuit is better in performance than conventional LIA. Another outstanding feature of the circuit is that it collects and transfers data from/to micro-processing unit (MPU) seamlessly.","Σ-Δ A/DC; Correlation principle; Digital integrator; Lock-in amplifier","Analog to digital conversion; Correlation theory; Delta sigma modulation; Digital integrated circuits; Microprocessor chips; Signal detection; Lock-in amplifiers; Micro-processing unit (MPU); Phase sensitive detectors; Weak signal detection; Amplifiers (electronic)",,,,,"Chen, J., (1987) The Detection of Weak Signal, , Beijing: Publishing House of Central Broadcasting and Television College, Chinese source; Feng, J., Chen, J., Physics of coherent detection in spectra measuring (1993) Physics, 22 (3), pp. 171-174. , Chinese source; Lai, F., Zhai, Y., Measurement of the thermal specification of thermistor by using phase-lock-amplifier (2002) Journal of Fujian Normal University, 18 (2), pp. 45-47. , Chinese source; Huang, S., Zang, G., Digital lock-in amplifier based on DSP and sampling ADC (2000) Journal of Data Acquisition and Processing, 15 (2), pp. 222-225; He, Q., An advanced fractional-n PLL frequency synthesizer (2003) Semiconductor Technology, 28 (3), pp. 74-76. , Chinese source; Zhong, J., Guo, X., Frequency synthesizer using sigma-delta modulation technology (2002) Electronic Engineer, 28 (6), pp. 55-58. , Chinese source; Li, S., Li, G., Sun, J., Analysis on the converting rate of Σ-Δ A/DC (2003) Measurement Technique, 6, pp. 28-30. , Chinese source; MSC1210 analog-to-digital converter with 8051 microcontroler and flash memory user's guide (2002), TI Corp","Lin, L.; Sch. of Precision Instrum., Tianjin Univ., Tianjin 300072, China; email: linling815@vip.sina.com",,,,,,,,04932137,,TCHHA,,"Chinese","Tianjin Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue yu Gongcheng Jishu Ban)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-14844355256

Synchrotron radiation (SR) has been mainly used for the measurements because of extremely weak signals that are about 0.3% of isotropic fluorescent radiation. The measurements limited to the use of a SR source clearly hinder from increasing the number of the users. Thus, we developed a laboratory XFH equipment with a conventional X-ray source by using a singly bent graphite monochromator with a large curvature and X-ray detector for a high counting rate. With this equipment, we have successfully demonstrated that high-quality hologram data of a gold single crystal almost equivalent to those with a SR source are obtained. Four different holograms are recorded in the normal and inverse XFH modes. An atomic image reconstructed from these holograms patterns shows a distinct atomic image of Au. © 2004 International Centre for Diffraction Data.",,"Atomic structures; X ray fluorescence holography (XFH); Absorption; Algorithms; Crystal atomic structure; Doping (additives); Fluorescence; Imaging techniques; Microscopic examination; Numerical methods; Single crystals; Synchrotron radiation; X ray diffraction analysis; Holography",,,,,"Barton, J.J., (1988) Phys.

In vitro detection methods using extracts from cell lysis cannot provide information about the spatial distribution of miRNAs. Due to the development of miRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), increasing amounts of intracellular expression information are being obtained. However, miRNA FISH suffers from weak signals and complex steps and thus remains very challenging. Herein, a strategy based on DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (AgNCs/DNAs) and their G-rich fluorescence enhancement effect was developed for FISH detection of miRNAs in gastric cancer cells. The method combines hybridization and signal amplification into one step, which allows imaging of intracellular miRNAs immediately after hybridization. Most importantly, using the method based on our design, miR-101-3p, miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p were found to be located in the nuclei of MGC803 cells with granulated shapes, indicating an unanticipated distribution pattern. In addition, before the final miRNA FISH, we performed an optimization of AgNCs/DNAs and their G-rich fluorescence enhancement effect; we found that the effect occurred at shorter wavelengths emitting green fluorescence, with weakened red fluorescence at longer wavelengths. However, the components involved in the FISH process impacted the fluorescence properties so greatly that the probes finally exhibited slightly strengthened red fluorescence signals. Our method enables facile visualization of miRNAs at the subcellular level, which may benefit the precise localization of miRNAs in single cells in the future. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cells; Cytology; Diseases; Fish; Fisheries; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Nanoclusters; Silver; Distribution patterns; Fluorescence enhancement effect; Fluorescence in situ hybridization; Fluorescence properties; Gastric cancer cells; Shorter wavelength; Signal amplifications; Silver nanoclusters; RNA; metal nanoparticle; microRNA; silver; chemistry; DNA probe; fluorescence in situ hybridization; genetics; human; stomach tumor; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Probes; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Metal Nanoparticles; MicroRNAs; Silver; Stomach Neoplasms",,"silver, 7440-22-4; DNA Probes; MicroRNAs; Silver",,,"Ferracin, M., Veronese, A., Negrini, M., (2010) Expert Rev.

However, how well it performs in high-dimensional regression is still poorly understood. Recently, Ando and Li [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 109 (2014) 254–265] introduced a new method of model averaging that allows the number of predictors to increase as the sample size increases. One notable feature of Ando and Li’s method is the relaxation on the total model weights so that weak signals can be efficiently combined from high-dimensional linear models. It is natural to ask if Ando and Li’s method and results can be extended to nonlinear models. Because all candidate models should be treated as working models, the existence of a theoretical target of the quasi maximum likelihood estimator under model misspecification needs to be established first. In this paper, we consider generalized linear models as our candidate models. We establish a general result to show the existence of pseudo-true regression parameters under model misspecification. We derive proper conditions for the leave-one-out cross-validation weight selection to achieve asymptotic optimality. Technically, the pseudo true target parameters between working models are not linearly linked. To overcome the encountered difficulties, we employ a novel strategy of decomposing and bounding the bias and variance terms in our proof. We conduct simulations to illustrate the merits of our model averaging procedure over several existing methods, including the lasso and group lasso methods, the Akaike and Bayesian information criterion model-averaging methods and some other state-of-the-art regularization methods. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2017.","Asymptotic optimality; High-dimensional regression models; Model averaging; Model misspecification",,,,,,"Akaike, H., On the likelihood of a time series model (1978) J.

However, the SBS noise arising from the unwanted coupling between photons and spontaneous non-coherent phonons in media is inevitable. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate this obstacle can be overcome via a method called orbital angular momentum mode division filtering. Owing to the introduction of a new distinguishable degree-of-freedom, even extremely weak signals can be discriminated and separated from a strong noise produced in SBS processes. The mechanism demonstrated in this proof-of-principle work provides a practical way for quasi-noise-free photonic-phononic operation, which is still valid in waveguides supporting multi-orthogonal spatial modes, permits more flexibility and robustness for future SBS devices. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"filtration; noise; orbit; phonon; photon",,,,,"Moody, J.D., Multistep redirection by cross-beam power transfer of ultrahigh-power lasers in a plasma (2012) Nat.

In particular, the systematic scanning of external expert opinions has been shown to be effective for the early detection of emerging threats and opportunities in an organization's environment. However, organizations tend to focus on internal advice more than on advice from external experts. This can be critical for organizations if it leads to an inertia in internal judgment, resulting in blind spots or a failure to see weak signals in the firm's periphery. In this article, we introduce a structured framework for the collection and structuring of internal and external expert judgment. This so-called 360∘ Stakeholder Feedback tool provides a structured and quantitative approach for the detection and discussion of blind spots and weak signals in scenario planning processes.

Although research has examined frameworks and concepts that lead to high-quality performance, few studies examine how to sustain high-quality performance. Sustaining performance may require additional capabilities from what it takes to achieve it. Drawing on quality management literature, organizational resilience literature, and the theory of dynamic capabilities in the strategy literature, this study empirically investigates the effects of four capabilities that help sustain high-quality performance. The analysis shows that capabilities in improvement, innovation, sensing weak signals, and responsiveness all help sustain high-quality performance. This suggests that what it takes to achieve high-quality performance is different, in part, from what it takes to sustain it. The data comes from a survey of 147 manufacturing business units. The analysis shows that the relative benefits of these capabilities may depend on the level of competitive intensity and environmental uncertainty. The findings provide empirical support for a theoretical model and practical guidance for sustaining quality performance. © 2016 Decision Sciences Institute","Dynamic capability; High reliability; Quality management; Resilience; Sustaining performance",,,,,,"Ahire, S.L., An empirical investigation of quality management in small firms (1996) Production & Inventory Management Journal, 37 (2), pp. 44-50; Ahire, S.L., O'Shaughnessy, K.C., The role of top management commitment in quality management: An empirical analysis of the auto parts industry (1998) International Journal of Quality Science, 3 (1), pp. 5-37; Aiken, L., West, S., (1991), #x0026;, Multiple regression Testing and interpreting interactions, Newbury Park, CA, Sage; Bagozzi, R.P., (1994), Advanced methods of marketing research, Cambridge, MA, Blackwell Business; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Benson, P.G., Saraph, J.V., Schroeder, R.G., The effects of organizational context on quality management: An empirical investigation (1991) Management Science, 37 (9), pp. 1107-1124; Berry, L.L., Parasuraman, A., Listening to the customer-the concept of a service-quality information system (1997) Sloan Management Review, 38, pp. 65-76; Bode, C., Wagner, S.M., Petersen, K.J., Ellram, L.M., Understanding responses to supply chain disruptions: Insights from Information processing and resource dependence perspectives (2011) Academy of Management Journal, 54 (4), pp. 833-856; Bodek, N., Green, J., (2011), #x0026;,).

As such crises are viewed as the result of a combination of two complementary cumulative processes of dysfunctions and ignorance. The concept of weak signal is introduced as an integral part of a theory of crisis to extend our conception of crisis and put forward the notion of genealogy of surprise. This approach to crisis contributes to the merging of risk communication and crisis communication because it acknowledges the developmental features of risks and crises, and recognizes that communication must be an integrated and ongoing process. Implications for risk and crisis communication are discussed in the conclusion. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Crisis; Crisis communication; Crisis definition; Crisis management; Crisis stages; Crisis theory; Risk communication; Weak signals",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Billings, R.S., Milburn, T.W., Schaalman, M.L., A model of crisis perception: A theoretical and empirical analysis (1980) Administrative Science Quarterly, 25, pp. 300-316; Boin, A., Lessons from crisis lessons (2004) International Studies Review, 6, pp. 165-194; Coombs, W.T., Information and compassion in crisis responses: A test of their effects (1999) Journal of Public Relations Research, 11 (2), pp. 125-142; Coombs, W.T., Holladay, S.J., Unpacking the halo effect: Reputation and crisis management (2006) Journal of Communication Management, 10 (2), pp. 123-137; Deschamps, I., Lalonde, M., Pauchant, T.C., Waaub, J.P., What crises could teach us about complexity and systemic management: The case of the Nestucca oil spill (1997) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 55, pp. 107-129; Forgues, B., Roux-Dufort, C., Crises: Events or processes (1998), Paper presented at Hazards and Sustainability Conference, Durham, UK, May 26-27; Francis, W., Catastrophes: une histoire culturelle, XVIe-XXIe siècles [Catastrophes: A cultural history, 16th-21st centuries] (2008), Paris: éditions du Seuil; Gundel, S., Towards a new typology of crises (2005) Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management, 13, pp. 106-115; Hermann, C.F., Some consequences of crisis which limit the viability of organizations (1963) Administrative Science Quarterly, 8, pp. 61-82; Hiltunen, E., The future signs and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 247-260; Janis, I.L., Crucial decisions: Leadership in policymaking and crisis management (1989), New York: Simon and Schuster; Kovoor-Misra, S., A multidimensional approach to crisis preparation for technical organizations: some critical factors (1995) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 48, pp. 143-160; Kouzmin, A., Crisis management in crisis (2008) Administrative Theory and Praxis, 30, pp. 155-183; Kuosa, T., Evolution of future studies (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 327-336; Lagadec, P., Katrina: Examen des rapports d'enquête [Katrina: Analysis of the investigation reports] (2007), Working Paper 2007-07, école Polytechnique, Paris; Lalonde, C., Roux-Dufort, C., Crisis management in institutional healthcare settings: From punitive to emancipatory solutions (2010) Organization Development Journal, 28 (1), pp. 19-36; Laufer, D., Coombs, W.T., How should a company respond to a product harm crisis?

Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) with Joint Transmission (JT) is a cellular networking technique allowing multiple Base Stations (BSs) to jointly transmit to a single user. This improves the users' reception quality and facilitates better service to cell-edge users. We consider a CoMP-enabled network, comprised of multiple BSs interconnected via a backhaul network. We formulate the OFDMA Joint Scheduling (OJS) problem of determining a subframe schedule and deciding if and how to use JT in order to maximize some utility function. We show that the OJS problem is NP-hard. We develop optimal and approximation algorithms for specific and general topologies, respectively. We consider a time dimension and study a queueing model with packet arrivals in which the service rates for each subframe are obtained by solving the OJS problem. We prove that when the problem is formulated with a specific utility function and solved optimally in each subframe, the resulting scheduling policy is throughput-optimal. Via extensive simulations we show that the bulk of the gains from CoMP with JT can be achieved with low capacity backhaul. Moreover, our algorithms distribute the network resources evenly, increasing the inter-cell users' throughput at only a slight cost to the intra-cell users. This is the first step towards a rigorous, network-level understanding of the impact of cross-layer scheduling algorithms on CoMP networks. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Approximation algorithms; Cellular networks; Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP); Joint transmission; Queueing networks; Scheduling","Algorithms; Cells; Cytology; Frequency division multiple access; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Problem solving; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Wireless networks; Cellular network; Coordinated multi point (CoMP); Cross layer scheduling; Extensive simulations; Joint transmissions; Scheduling policies; Strong interference; Throughput-optimal; Approximation algorithms",,,,,"3GPP, (2013) Coordinated multi-point operation for LTE physical layer aspects (Release 11), , TR 36.819, September; Irmer, R., Droste, H., Marsch, P., Grieger, M., Fettweis, G., Brueck, S., Mayer, H.-P., Jungnickel, V., Coordinated multipoint: Concepts, performance, and field trial results (2011) IEEE Commun.

In both of these examples, social media played a key role in group formation and organization, and in the coordination of the group's subsequent collective actions (i.e., the move from rhetoric to action). Surprisingly, despite its clear importance, little is understood about the factors that lead to this kind of group development and the transition to collective action. This paper focuses on an approach to the analysis of data from social media to detect weak signals, i.e., indicators that initially appear at the fringes, but are, in fact, early indicators of such large-scale real-world phenomena. Our approach is in contrast to existing research which focuses on analysing major themes, i.e., the strong signals, prevalent in a social network at a particular point in time. Analysis of weak signals can provide interesting possibilities for forecasting, with online user-generated content being used to identify and anticipate possible offline future events. We demonstrate our approach through analysis of tweets collected during the London riots in 2011 and use of our weak signals to predict tipping points in that context. © 2015 ACM.","Collective action; Content analysis; Early detection; Forecasting; London riots; Social media; Twitter; Weak signals","Forecasting; Signal detection; Collective action; Content analysis; London riots; Social media; Twitter; Weak signals; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Forsyth, D.R., (2009) Group Dynamics, , Wadsworth/Cengage; Diani, M., McAdam, D., (2003) Social Movements and Networks: Relational Approaches to Collective Action, , ser.

The theory postulates a set of technologies and practices that are unique to each wave. Although a challenge of the Kondratieff wave theory is great variance in interpretations about the timing of the waves among scholars, based on several analyses we suggest that with the financial crisis of 2008, and resulting economic instability, we are experiencing the end of the fifth wave and the emergence of the sixth. We take as our starting point the global trends, particularly those of scarcity and the rising cost of commodities such as energy and raw materials that have led to a widely shared hypothesis that resource productivity will be the key driver of technology and economic growth in the next wave. Socially, this driver will be fortified by growing environmental concerns since climate change and the destruction of natural ecosystems seem inevitably to proceed. Both these sources are boosting a generation of new companies and behaviour. In this article our focus is to evaluate weak signals that point to possible directions for the future of organisational practices in the sixth Kondratieff wave. We ask what will be the effects of the changing socio-technical landscape on the working life and organisational culture. The K-waves theory explains how certain ways of organising that have so far developed in the fringes of organisational culture may move into the mainstream, as a product of the systemic restructuring that has often accompanied the new K-wave. We present our findings from a workshop with representatives of five different resource efficiency oriented organisations in the Silicon Valley area. Based on the data we have gathered through the workshop and complementing interviews, we show how organisations base their considerations about the future to a surprisingly large extent on ethical arguments. Our material also includes a case that shows that this ethical approach is not self-evidently related to the aim for resource efficiency. We evaluate our results in the Future Sign - framework presented by Hiltunen. The signals we have gathered are combined with corporate shared value - thinking, and both are interpreted through the Kondratieff - wave theory. Based on our sample of five cases, along with a framework that supports our interpretation, we suggest the ethical motivations as backbone of organisations is a relatively strong future sign that has potential for strengthening in the sixth wave context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethics; Future sign; Kondratieff waves; Resource efficiency; Sixth wave; Social change","economic growth; economic instability; economic theory; ethics; future prospect; socioeconomic conditions; technological development; theoretical study",,,,,"(2014), http://www.ge.com/about-us/ecomagination, See; (2014), http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/, See; (2014), http://rt.com/usa/google-billion-solar-power-457/, See; (2014), http://www.givesomethingback.com/; (2014), http://www.newleafpaper.com/; (2014), http://www.shareable.net/; (2014), https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome; (2014), http://www.vinestove.com/; Arthur, W.B., The second economy (2011) McKinsey Quarterly, , https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/The_second_economy_2853; Ayres, R.U., Technological transformations long waves part I (1990) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 36, pp. 111-137; Ayres, R.U., Technological transformations long waves part II (1990) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 37, pp. 1-37; Barnosky, A.D., Hadly, E.A., Bascompte, J., Berlow, E.L., Brown, J.H., Fortelius, M., Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere (2012) Nature, 486, pp. 52-58; Braudel, F., (1996) The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II, , University of California Press, Berkeley; Brynjolfsson, E., McAfee, A., (2011) Race against the machine: How the digital revolution is accelerating innovation, driving productivity, and irreversibly transforming employment and the economy, , Digital Frontier Press, Lexington, Mass; Dator, J., From tsunamis to long waves and back (1999) Futures, 31 (1); Dator, J., Alternative futures for K-waves (2006) Kondratieff waves, warfare and world security, pp. 311-317. , IOS Press, Amsterdam, T.C.

Furthermore, we analyze whether internal experts (experts employed with firms) and external experts (e.g., consultants) differ in the importance they attribute to signals as predictors of technological discontinuities. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset obtained from a conjoint analysis conducted with 29 experts in the ICT industry. The conjoint approach allows for a simulation of the forecasting process and considers utility trade-offs. The results show that for both types of experts the perceived benefit of users most highly contributes to predicting technological discontinuities. Internal experts assign more importance to legal frameworks (e.g., standards) as signals helping them to predict technological discontinuities than external experts. The latter, in turn, assign more importance to profit margins and the recombination potential of technologies than their internal counterparts. Our results add important insights to the literature on R&D and innovation management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While companies are compelled to manage exploration projects, the processes underlying the expansion of knowledge in these projects are not well known. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the literature, this paper first presents a conceptual view of the notion of expert. Then, the research question is analyzed by means of a case study of a polar expedition. The project leader seeks a knowledgeable person who has never been identified as an expert, but whose knowledge is essential. Findings – The expert appears both in his cognitive and social dimensions. Moreover, he emerges out of the situation, on the basis of neither strong nor weak signals. The rationality of expert solicitation falls within a pragmatic logic where the acquired knowledge must reduce the uncertainty so that the project can progress. The learning process enables to increase gradually the knowledge of the actor but also to build the legitimacy required in order to have access to the expert. Practical implications – Findings can be translated in more general situations. Indeed, polar expeditions projects and exploratory innovation projects (Garel and Lièvre, 2010) possess some common characteristics: lack of knowledge concerning, timing issues, need to implement a pragmatic, enquiry-based learning. These projects strongly rely on external expert knowledge. This case study suggests that, while it may be useful, planning should not strictly define the course of action. A central competence of the project leader is to manage the duality between planning and adaptation. This implies the ability to adapt, to detect and to assess human resources and knowledge flows rapidly, as well as to weave social links inside and outside the organisation. Originality/value – The existing literature offers a comprehensive view of experts in an organisation. However, the questions of expert selection and identification remain open. This paper fills a gap in the literature concerning the way experts are identified and selected. The case study shows that identifying experts does not solely depend on weak signals (reputation) or on strong signals (the expert’s social status). Rather, the expert emerges in the situation, in an unexpected way. The expert’s social dimension is not sufficient and one must look to the cognitive roots of the expertise. On the other hand, the fact is emphasised that the expert is a social construct which emerges from the solicitation process. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Experts; Knowledge; Learning; Project management; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Amin, A., Cohendet, P., (2004) Architectures of Knowledge, Firms, Communities and Competencies, , andOxford University Press, Oxford:; Ancori, B., Expertise et citoyenneté: les Grecs anciens et nous (2009) Revue d’anthropologie des connaissances, 3 (1), pp. 485-529. , , Vol.No., pp; Belleval, C., Deniaud, I., Lerch, C., A model for the management of design project issues: the case of the microsatellites design (2010) International Journal of Design and Innovation Research, 5 (1). , and, Vol.No; Ben Mahmoud-Jouini, S., Charue-Duboc, F., Enhancing discontinuous innovation through knowledge combination: the case of an exploratory unit within an established automotive firm (2008) Creativity and Innovation Management, 17 (2), pp. 127-135. , and, Vol.No., pp; Bootz, J.P., Schenk, E., Comment gérer les experts au sein et en dehors des communautés?

In foresight studies, usually their positive impact on the quality of life is considered or their negative environmental effects. This paper seeks to draw attention to an overlooked ""dark side"" of new technologies: their potential abuse by terrorists or organized crime. Recent cybercrime events are examples of abuse that perhaps could have been minimized if appropriate foresight studies were performed years ago. This was the aim of the recently completed EU-funded project FESTOS. Design/methodology/approach: Several foresight methodologies were employed. Following a horizon scanning for potentially threatening technologies, a Delphi-type expert survey helped to evaluate critical threat characteristics of selected 33 technologies: the likelihood that each technology will actually come to pose a security threat (in different time frames), the easiness of its malicious use, the severity of the threat, and the most threatened societal spheres. Findings: The results enabled ranking the technologies by their ""abuse potential"" and ""threat intensity"". Certain emerging technologies (or their combinations), regarded as ""weak signals"", inspired ideas for potential ""wild cards"". In a subsequent workshop, which employed a variant of the ""futures wheel"" method, four wild-card ""scenario sketches"" were constructed. These were later developed to full narrative scenarios. Originality/value: The entire process enables the introduction of security foresight into policy planning in a long-range perspective. The foresight results were followed by the evaluation of policy implications and coping with the knowledge control dilemma. The paper illustrates how a mix of foresight methods can help in a continuous analysis of new and threats posed by emerging technologies, thus raising awareness of decision makers and mitigating the risk of unforeseen surprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Emerging technologies; Foresight; Future threats; Security; Signals of change; Wild cards",,,,,,"Auffermann, B., Luoto, L., (2011) Integrated Security Threats Report, FESTOS Deliverable D3.3, , http://tinyurl.com/9auvja8, partners with contribution from all, available at; Brown, J., Isaacs, D., (2005) The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter, , Berrett-Koehler, San Francisco, CA; Dienel, H.L., Peperhove, R., (2011), Final Scenario and Indicators Report, FESTOS Deliverable D4.3; Glenn, J.C., (2009) The Futures Wheel, in Futures Research Methodology - V3.0, , Glenn, J.C., Gordon, T.J.

Findings-The major contribution is that the paper finds evidence suggesting that signal strength does indeed matter. The paper finds that a weak signal is more likely to produce herding when respondents answer questions relating their own decisions and strong signals produce more herding when respondents provide advice to others. The paper also finds that women are less likely to herd and people who report they are susceptible to information influences are more likely to herd. Not surprisingly, participants who are morally opposed to strategic default are less likely to herd in most scenarios.

People always connect to the Internet while moving. Although portable device can provide high-speed connectivity, a user may move into area with weak signal or thin bandwidth, which possibly hinder the reception of satisfactory multimedia traffic. In this paper, a ubiquitous computing platform is designed for quality control of multimedia and data context through the Internet to users. For the proposed platform to perform properly, traffic content should be classified into real-time or non-real-time, casual or critical, data or multimedia traffic type. Indeed, a session may consist of different traffic classes. Information for classifications may be identified through the communications between content providers and clients, or through direct communication between the platform and providers or clients. It is the goal of the proposed Quality of Service control framework which provides mechanisms for delivering satisfactory content to subscribers, through content adaptation and selections. The focus of this paper will be on setting real-time performance bound regarding multimedia traffic. Quality of images and videos can be adapted to fit different performance constraints in networks. Furthermore, traffic becomes redundant and useless when delivered information exceeds the delay tolerance of human beings. In our proposed platform, modifications are executed through agent technology inside the Internet. Thorough experiments have been carried out, and the impacts of real-time bounds are examined. Measured results indicate that the proposed framework works and meets the expectations of end-users. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Egress agent; Ingress agent; Monitoring capsules; Perceptual satisfaction; QoS control framework; Ubiquitous multimedia computing","Agent technology; Content adaptation; Content providers; Data contexts; Direct communications; End-users; High-speed; Human being; Measured results; Multimedia traffic; Perceptual satisfaction; Performance constraints; Portable device; QoS control; Quality-of-service control; Real time performance; Traffic class; Ubiquitous multimedia; Weak signals; Wireless devices; Internet; Quality of service; Ubiquitous computing",,,,,"Banavar, G., Bernstein, A., Software infrastructure and design challenges for ubiquitous computing (2002) Commun ACM, 45 (12), pp. 92-96; Byers, J.W., Considine, J., Mitzenmacher, M., Rost, S., Informed content delivery across adaptive overlay networks (2004) IEEE/ACM Trans Netw, 12 (5), pp. 767-780; Chen, B., Cheng, H.H., A review of the applications of agent technology in traffic and transportation systems (2010) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 11 (2), pp. 485-497; Daly, S., The visible differences predictor: An algorithm for the assessment of image fidelity (1993) Digital Images and Human Vision, pp. 179-206. , In: Watson AB, MIT Press, Cambridge; Fielding, R., (1999) Hypertext Transfer Protocol-HTTP/1. 1, , IETF, RFC 2616; (1996) Methods For Subjective Determination of Transmission Quality, , ITU-T Recommendation P. 800, International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T); Johnson, D., Perkins, C., Arkko, J., (2004) IP Mobility Support For IPv6, , IETF, RFC 3775; Jrad, Z.E.-F., Benmammar, B., Correa, J., Krief, F., Mbarek, N., A user assistant for QoS negotiation in a dynamic environment using agent technology (2005) 2nd IFIP International Conference On Wireless Optical Communications Networks (WOCN), pp. 270-274; Law, K.L.E., Lau, C., Mobility service agent (2010) 3rd IEEE Workshop On Wireless and Internet Services (WISe), In Conjunction With 35th IEEE Conference On Local Computer Networks (LCN); Lee, J.-S., Hsu, P.-L., Implementation of a remote hierarchical supervision system using petri nets and agent technology (2007) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part C, 37 (1), pp. 77-85; Lum, W.Y., Lau, F.C.M., A context-aware decision engine for content adaptation (2002) IEEE Pervasive Comput, 1 (3), pp. 41-49; Noble, B.D., System support for mobile, adaptive applications (2000) IEEE Pers Commun, 7 (1), pp. 44-49; Perkins, C., (2002) IP Mobility Support For IPv4, , IETF, RFC 3344; Pratistha, I.M., Zaslavsky, A., Cuce, S., Dick, M., Improving operational efficiency of web services with mobile agent technology (2005) IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference On Intelligent Agent Technology, pp. 725-731; Rahrer, T., Fiandra, R., Wright, S., (2006) Triple-play Services Quality of Experience (QoE) Requirements, , DSL Forum, Architecture & Transport Working Group, technical report TR-126; Satyanarayanan, M., Pervasive computing: vision and challenges (2001) IEEE Pers Commun, 8 (4), pp. 10-17","Law, K.

They are important as an intermediate step between stationary and Loève's harmonizable processes, perhaps the most general case that can be described with second-order statistics. However, when the cyclostationary period is unknown, or there are several periods, one must compute the Loève spectrum to isolate the relevant period or periods. This entails a high ""false discovery"" rate because, for a series of N samples, such spectra includes ∼ N 2 individual cross-spectra or coherence estimates. Moreover, most processes encountered from both natural and engineering sources contain many weak periodic, or almost periodic, components. For example, the RF spectrum is littered with weak signals from distant sources, intermodulation products, radiation from poorly-shielded digital circuits, etc. Similarly, processes such as daily temperature records contain evidence of many discrete solar normal modes. Because one sinusoid looks much like another, these cause spurious peaks in a Loève two-frequency coherence estimate. I show examples from daily temperature series and dropped calls in cellular phone systems. This paper describes a process for estimating the Loève spectrum via a singular value decomposition of multitaper eigencoefficients that is considerably faster than the direct method. Because it involves O(N) individual hypothesis tests the false alarm rate is lower than the naive approach. I also describe a multivariate, T 2, version of the harmonic F-test for simultaneous periodic components, and this has proven useful both for reducing the false alarm rate and for identifying some unexpected signals. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Almost periodic; Cellular phone systems; Cross spectra; Cyclostationary; Cyclostationary process; Daily temperatures; Direct method; Distant source; Eigen-coefficients; False alarm rate; Harmonizable process; Hypothesis tests; In-field; Inter-modulation products; Normal modes; Periodic components; RF-spectrum; Second order statistics; Weak signals; Errors; Estimation; Timing jitter",,,,,"Hurd, H.L., Miamee, A., (2007) Periodically Correlated Random Sequences, , John Wiley and Sons, New York; Lepage, K.Q., Thomson, D.J., Spectral analysis of cyclostationary time-series: A robust method (2009) Geophys.

The originality of the paper comes from some blocks proposal, which selective amplify the bio signals. One of the major problems in the electrophysiological signals monitoring is the impossibility to record the weak signals from deep organs that are covered by noise or by strong cardiac or muscular signals. An automatic gain control block is used, so that the high power skin signals are less amplified than the low components. The analog processing block is based on a dynamic range compressor, containing the automatic gain control block.

But the traditional differential method has a problem that the coherent integration time could not be too long and can hardly acquire very weak GPS signal. This paper introduces an improved differential coherent integration algorithm based on optimum path method, which can find the path of the maximum sum of differential blocks by estimating every possible product of the adjacent navigation data bits. So it could overcome the influence of navigation data bit transition and the long time coherent integration can be used in the differential method. Another advantage of this new method is that the loss of the square is reduced, because of the differential operation. Simulations show that, in the weak signal environment, if the same C/N0 and processing data length are provided, the performance of the new method is much better than the legacy half-bits method and full-bits method. With the increacing of the processing data length, the advantage of the new method on signal to noise ratio improvement is more significant. © 2010 IEEE.","Coherent integration; Differentially coherent integration; Optimum path; Squaring loss","C/A code acquisition; Coherent integration; Coherent integration time; Data length; Differential methods; Differential operation; GPS signals; Long-time coherent integrations; Navigation data; Optimum path; Path method; Path-based; Squaring loss; Weak signals; Algorithms; Data handling; Global positioning system; Integration; Navigation; Signal to noise ratio; Structural analysis; Ubiquitous computing; Signal processing",,,,,"Tsui James, B.-Y., (2005) Fundamentals of Global Positioning System Receiver a Software Approach, pp. 230-232. , (Second Edition) Hoboken, New Jersey: John Willy & Sons, Inc; Schmid, A., Neubauer, A., Performance evaluation of differential correlation for single shot measurement positioning Proc.

One of the main issues related to this type of systems is the time synchronization between receivers. The required precision of the synchronization depends on the type of data the receivers exchange. This paper presents a new technique devoted to solve the synchronization problem in a network of collaborative users, equipped with low cost GNSS receivers. Such a technique is based on the joint processing of the same GNSS signal received at different nodes of the network and exploits some attributes of the GNSS signal to evaluate the synchronization offset. The paper describes the new technique with the appropriated theory and gathers the results of some measurements performed in a real scenario. Moreover, on the basis of the clock offset estimate, an acquisition algorithm for aided GPS systems has been developed and tested in a real indoor application. ©2010 IEEE.","Assisted GPS; Time synchronization; Weak signals","Assisted GPS; Clock offset; Collaborative systems; Collaborative users; GNSS receivers; GNSS signals; Indoor applications; Joint processing; Low costs; Required precision; Synchronization problem; Time synchronization; Weak signals; Navigation; Signal processing; Synchronization; Global positioning system",,,,,"(2010) Deliverable D2: ""The Core Localization Framework: Algorithms and Architectures for Cooperative Localization in Emergency Scenarios"", , SALICE project, version 1, May; Dovis, F., Lesca, R., Margaria, D., Boiero, G., Ghinamo, G., An Assisted High-Sensitivity Acquisition Technique for GPS Indoor Positioning IEEE/ION PLANS 2008, Monterey, California (USA), May 5-8, 2008; Lachapelle, G., GNSS Indoor Localization Technologies (2004) Journal of Global Positioning Systems, 3 (1-2), pp. 2-11; Detoma, E., Capetti, P., Pielmeier, J., Maltzahn, U., Risueno, G.L., Precise Time and Frequency Distribution over a Wireless Network for A-GNSS Users IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium, 2009 Joint with the 22nd European Frequency and Time Forum, Besançon, France, Apr. 20-24, 2009, pp. 411-415; http://ieee1588.nist.gov/, PTP; www.ntp.org; Allan, D.W., Weiss, M.A., Accurate Time and Frequency Transfer during Common-View of a GPS Satellite 34th Annual Frequency Control Symposium, May 1980, pp. 334-346; Fantino, M., Molino, A., Nicola, M., N-Gene GNSS Receiver: Benefits of Software Radio in Navigation ENC-GNSS 2009, 3-6 May 2009, Naples, , http://www.encgnss09.it/proceedingsPDF/B2/3_B2.pdf, Available online; Kaplan, E.D., Hegarty, C., Understanding GPS: Principles and Applications (2006) Artech House Mobile Communications Series","Digenti, S.; Electronics Department, NavSAS, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy; email: Sebastiano.Digenti@polito.it",,,,"5th ESA Workshop on Satellite Navigation Technologies and European Workshop on GNSS Signals and Signal Processing, NAVITEC 2010","8 December 2010 through 10 December 2010","Noordwijk",84055,,9781424487417,,,"English","Programme Abstr.

Firstly, the array gain and phase mismatch is estimated using the norm of the error vector between the practical steering vector and the theoretical vector of the strong signal, and then the data covariance matrix is calibrated. Secondly, the new seek vectors are obtained by the eigenbeamforming normalization with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the calibrated covariance matrix. Finally, the directions of arrival of all the signals are estimated according to the spatial spectrum like MUSIC with the new seek steering vector.

Based on this algorithm, the receiver needn't accomplish the bit synchronization, frame synchronization and navigation data demodulation, which were usually necessary for the conventional GPS receiver, it could implement the positioning solution only by the measurement of pseudo-code phase and the assistance data (including ephemeris information and satellite clock corrections etc.). Compared with the conventional GPS positioning algorithm, the proposed algorithm increases the ambiguity of the signal transmission time as an unknown parameter for the pseudorange equation.

To this end, we propose a new adaptive detection rule. It is defined by plugging a kernel density estimator f̂ of f into the maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector. The estimate f̂ can either be computed off-line from a training sequence or on-line simultaneously with the detection. For the off-line detector, we prove that the (asymptotic) error probability for weak signals converges to the minimal error probability of the MAP detector as the number of training data tends to infinity, and we also establish rates of convergence and the optimal choice of bandwidth order for a certain class of noise densities. In a Monte Carlo study, the off-line plug-in MAP detectors are compared with the L 1 - and L 2 -detectors for various noise distributions. When the training sequence is long enough, the plug-in detectors have excellent performance for a wide range of distributions, whereas the L 2 -detector breaks down for heavy-tailed distributions and the L 1 -detector for distributions with little mass around the origin. © 1997 IEEE.","Adaptive; Additive noise; Detection; Kernel estimate; Nonparametric; Training sequence","Bandwidth; Error analysis; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Probability density function; Signal detection; Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator; Adaptive filtering",,,,,"Beran, R., Asymptotically efficient adaptive rank estimates in location models (1974) Ann.

Not all such devices will experience the promised 10 year battery life despite the high density of LPWAN gateways expected in cities. Transmission from devices located deep within buildings or in remote neighborhoods will suffer severe attenuation forcing the use of slow data-rates to reach even the closest gateway, thus resulting in battery drain. This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances both the battery life of client devices and the coverage of LPWANs in large urban deployments. Charm allows multiple LoRaWAN gateways to pool their received signals in the cloud, coherently combining them to detect weak signals that are not decodable at any individual gateway. Through a novel hardware and software design at the gateway, Charm carefully detects which chunks of the received signal need to be sent to the cloud, thereby saving uplink bandwidth. We present a scalable solution to decoding weak transmissions at city-scale by identifying the set of gateways whose signals need to be coherently combined over time. In evaluations over a test network and from simulations using traces from a large LoRaWAN deployment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Charm demonstrates a gain of up to 3x in range and 4x in client battery-life. © 2018 IEEE.","coherent combining; diversity; LPWAN; sensor networks","Decoding; Electric batteries; Low power electronics; Sensor networks; Software design; Wide area networks; Battery powered devices; Coherent combining; diversity; LPWAN; Received signals; Scalable solution; Uplink bandwidth; Wireless platform; Gateways (computer networks)",,,,,"Checko, A., Cloud RAN for mobile networksâǍŤA technology overview (2015) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 17 (1), pp. 405-426. , (2015); Del Coso, A., Cooperative distributed MIMO channels in wireless sensor networks (2007) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 25, p. 2. , (2007); Liu, C., The case for re-configurable backhaul in cloud-RAN based small cell networks (2013) Proceedings of the 32nd IEEE Infocom, pp. 1124-1132; Shepard, C., Argos: Practical many-antenna base stations (2012) Proceedings of the 18th ACM MobiCom, pp. 53-64; Sabella, D., RAN as a service: Challenges of designing a flexible RAN architecture in a cloud-based heterogeneous mobile network (2013) Proceedings of the Future Network and Mobile Summit (Future Network Summit), pp. 1-8; Wubben, D., Benefits and impact of cloud computing on 5G signal processing: Flexible centralization through cloud-RAN (2014) IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 31 (6), pp. 35-44. , (2014); Larsson, E.G., Massive MIMO for next generation wireless systems (2014) IEEE Communications Magazine, 52 (2), pp. 186-195. , (2014); Hamed, E., Real-time distributed MIMO systems Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM 2016 Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication, pp. 412-425; Rahul, H.S., JMB: Scaling wireless capacity with user demands Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGCOMM 2012 Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication, pp. 235-246; Bor, M., Do LoRa low-power wide-area networks scale?

It is based on the ontology of a technology trend, hype cycles methodology, and semantic indicators which provide evidence of a maturity level of a technology. This approach forms the basis for implementation of text-mining software tools. Algorithms behind these tools allow users to escape from getting too general or garbage results which make it impossible to identify promising technologies at early stages (early detection, weak signals). Besides, these algorithms provide high-quality results in extraction of complex multiword terms which correspond to technological concepts forming a trend. Methodology and software developed as a result of this study are applicable to various industries with minor adjustments and require no deep expert knowledge from a user. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","early detection; emerging trend; full text analysis; hype cycle; knowledge extraction; maturity level; ontology; promising solution; semantic indicator; Technology trend monitoring; weak signal",,,,,,"Ahn, S.-H., An evaluation of green manufacturing technologies based on research databases (2014) International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing.

In general, a signal search (carrier frequency and code phase) is implemented using two-dimensional partitioned fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which is limited by the memory of the processor. Nevertheless, the carrier's continuity is damaged by the circular shift. Noncoherent integration is performed to circumvent this problem. However, the acquisition sensitivity will be reduced because of the square loss. In this paper, we analyze the processing flow of traditional noncoherent integration method and the new presented coherent integration method with compensation. Besides, the comparison of computation cost between the new approach and the conventional method is done. Numerical results show that the coherent method can improve the sensitivity of acquiring weak signals and save about 60% computation cost as well. © 2016 IEEE.","acquisition; coherent integration; compensation; computaton cost; fast fourier transform (FFT); high sensitivity; Inter-satellite link","Compensation (personnel); Costs; Fast Fourier transforms; Image processing; Integration; Numerical methods; Satellite links; Satellites; Signal receivers; acquisition; Coherent integration; Conventional methods; Direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) signal; High sensitivity; Inter-satellite link; Navigation constellations; Non coherent integration; Signal processing",,,,,"Ananda, M.P., Bernstein, H., Cunningham, K.E., Feess, W.A., Stroud, E.G., Global positioning system (GPS) autonomous navigation (1990) IEEE PLANS90: Position Location and Navigation Symposium Record, Las Vegas, NV, pp. 479-508. , Mar; Amarillo, F., Gerner, J.L., Sanchez, J.M., Pulido, A., The ESA GNSS+"" project: Inter-Satellite ranging and communication links in the frame of the GNSS infrastructure evolutions (2008) Proc. of the 21st International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, pp. 2538-2546. , Savannah, GA Sept; Liu, J., Geng, T., Zhao, Q., Enhancing precise orbit determination of Compass with inter-satellite observations (2011) Survey Rev, 43 (322), pp. 333-342. , September; Maine, K.P., Langer, J.P., Crosslinks for the nextgeneration GPS (2003) Proc. of the 2003 IEEE Aerospace Conf, 4, pp. 1589-1596. , Los Angeles, CA March; Ziedan, N.I., Garrison, J.L., Unaided acquisition of weak GPS signals using circular correlation or double-block zero padding (2004) Position Location and Navigation Symposium, Monterey, pp. 461-470; Leclère, J., Botteron, C., Farine, P.-A., Acquisition of modern GNSS signals using a modified parallel code-phase search architecture (2014) Signal Processing, 95, pp. 177-191. , Aug; Wilhelmsson, L., Reial, A., GPS receiver using differential correlation (2005) Eur; Lin, D.M., Tsui, L.B.Y., Comparison of acquisition methods for software GPS receivers (2000) Proc. of the 13th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GPS 2000), pp. 2385-2390. , Salt Lake City; Lin, D.M., Tsui, L.B.Y., Howell, D., Direct P(Y)-code acquisition algorithm for software GPS receivers (1999) Proc. of the 12th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GPS 1999), pp. 363-367. , Nashville; Heckler, G.W., Garrison, J.L., Implementation and testing of an unaided method for the acquisition of weak GPS C/A code signals (2009) Navigation, 56, pp. 241-259; Tang, Y.Y., Wang, Y.K., Chen, J., Guo, X., Highsensitive acquisition of signals for inter-satellite links of navigation constellation (2015) Electronics Letters, 51 (23), pp. 1879-1880; Li, X.B., Wang, Y.K., Chen, J.Y., Ni, S.C., Rapid acquisition assisted by navigation data for inter-satellite links of navigation constellation (2014) IEICE Transactions On Communications, 4, pp. 915-922; Kaplan, E.D., Hegarty, C.J., (2006) Understanding GPS:principles and Applications 2nd Ed, pp. 219-230. , Artech House Inc: London; Misra, P., Enge, P., (2007) Principles of GPS and Receiver Design 2nd Ed, pp. 347-353. , Publishing House of Electronics Industry: Beijing",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing, ICSIP 2016","13 August 2016 through 15 August 2016",,127096,,9781509023769,,,"English","IEEE Int.

To combat such abuse, OSNs allow users to report fraudulent profiles or activity. The OSN can then use reporting data to review and/or limit activity of reported accounts. Previous authors have suggested that an OSN can augment its takedown algorithms by identifying a “trusted set” of users whose reports are weighted more heavily in the disposition of flagged accounts. Such identification would allow the OSN to improve both speed and accuracy of fake account detection and thus reduce the impact of spam on users. In this work we provide the first public, data-driven assessment of whether the above assumption is true: are some users better at reporting than others? Specifically, is reporting skill both measurable, i.e., possible to distinguish from random guessing; and repeatable, i.e., persistent over repeated sampling? Our main contributions are to develop a statistical framework that describes these properties and to apply this framework to data from LinkedIn, the professional social network. Our data includes member reports of fake profiles as well as the more voluminous, albeit weaker, signal of member responses to connection requests. We find that members demonstrating measurable, repeatable skill in identifying fake profiles do exist but are rare: at most 2.4% of those reporting fakes and at most 1.3% of those rejecting connection requests. We conclude that any reliable “trusted set” of members will be too small to have noticeable impact on spam metrics. © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)","Fake accounts; Online trust; Reputation systems; Social networks; Spam detection","Online systems; Fake accounts; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSNs); Online trust; Professional social networks; Reputation systems; Spam detection; Statistical framework; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Barnard, G., A new test for 2 2 tables (1945) Nature, 156, p. 177; Bonneau, J., Bursztein, E., Caron, I., Jackson, R., Williamson, M., Secrets, lies, and account recovery: Lessons from the use of personal knowledge questions at Google (2015) WWW, pp. 141-150; Bonneau, J., Herley, C., Van Oorschot, P., Stajano, F., The past, present, and future of password-based authentication on the web (2015) Commun.

The author directly connects the recent rise of corporate foresight with MNCs' growing need to fill the gaps in traditional corporate strategic management, which struggles with the challenges of today's global turbulent business-environment (known as VUCA world characterised by unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity). From this perspective, corporate foresight is capable of providing a number of viable responses. They include the significant expansion of the horizon of MNCs' long-term future vision, enhanced capabilities of business-environment scanning (identifying not only clearly visible trends but the so-called weak signals as well) and strengthening intra-firm communications over the course of the strategy development process, thus contributing to the implementation capacity of the multinational corporate team. Within the analysis of the actual corporate foresight practices of major multinationals, special attention is paid to the common features of foresight organisation (standard process phases, the typical set of methods used) and peculiarities related mainly to different MNCs' sector-specific environment characteristics, including the complexity and dynamics of change. An attempt is also made to describe the actual impact of corporate foresight activities on the effectiveness of the key functions of MNCs' strategic management. The author draws the conclusion that corporate foresight is becoming a core element of the strategic management architecture of multinational businesses, striving to protect and strengthen its global market positioning in an increasingly turbulent and unpredictable environment. For MNCs' top management, trying to find the right strategic course in a radically changing competitive landscape, this powerful tool is increasingly playing the same role as a GPS navigator for drivers lost in an unfamiliar city.","Corporate foresight; Corporate strategic management; Multinational corporations; Strategic positioning in global markets; Turbulent global environment",,,,,,"Ansoff, I., (1965) Corporate Strategy, , New York: McGrow-Hill; Ansoff, I., (1979) Strategic Management, , London: Macmillan; Ansoff, I., Declerck, R.P., Hayes, R.L., (1976) From Strategic Planning to Strategic Management.

Previous attempts of data-driven technology roadmaps have mainly focused on data from such sources as patents and literatures. However, as these sources catalogue posteriori trends of evolution, roadmaps based on these data cannot be counted on to predict disruptions. In this regard, futuristic data in technology foresight websites may provide a better source. The objective of this research, in response, is to develop a support system for technology roadmapping that uses futuristic data. To this end, we suggest keyword-based visual scanning approach involving three keyword maps, used in succession: keyword cluster map, keyword intensity map, and keyword relationship map. Particularly, keyword intensity map is designed using weak signal theory which can help identify the visibility, diffusion, and interpretation of signals. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","futuristic data; Technology roadmapping; visual analysis; weak signal","technological development; visual analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, (2), pp. 21-34. , citeulike-article-id:1109593; Cable, J.H., Ordonez, J.F., Chintalapani, G., Plaisant, C., (2004), “Project Portfolio Earned Value Management Using Treemaps.” Proceedings of the Project Management Institute Research Conference, London; Cachia, R., Compañó, R., Da Costa, O., Grasping the Potential of Online Social Networks for Foresight (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74 (8), pp. 1179-1203; Choi, S., Kim, H., Yoon, J., Kim, K., Lee, J.Y., An SAO-Based Text-Mining Approach for Technology Roadmapping Using Patent Information (2013) R and D Management, 43 (1), pp. 52-74; Christensen, C.M., Baumann, H., Ruggles, R., Sadtler, T.M., Disruptive Innovation for Social Change (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (12), pp. 94-101; Davies, D.L., Bouldin, D.W., A Cluster Separation Measure (1979) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine IntelligencePAMI-1, (2), pp. 224-227; Drew, S.A.W., Building Technology Foresight: Using Scenarios to Embrace Innovation (2006) European Journal of Innovation Management, 9 (3), pp. 241-257; Flexer, A., On the Use of Self-Organizing Maps for Clustering and Visualization (2001) Intelligent Data Analysis, 5 (5), pp. 373-384. , IOS Press; Geum, Y., Lee, H.J., Lee, Y., Park, Y., Development of Data-Driven Technology Roadmap Considering Dependency: An ARM-Based Technology Roadmapping (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 91, pp. 264-279. , Elsevier Inc; Hamel, G., (2002) Leading the Revolution: How to Thrive in Turbulent Times by Making Innovation a Way of Life, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Hiltunen, E., The Future Sign and Its Three Dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Jeong, Y., Yoon, B., Development of Patent Roadmap Based on Technology Roadmap by Analyzing Patterns of Patent Development (2015) Technovation, 39-40 (May), pp. 37-52; Kim, J., Park, Y., (2014), “Supporting Technology Foresight for Disruptive Innovation : Keyword-Based Visual Analysis for Futuristic Data.” Proceedings of the Asia Pacific Industrial Engineering & Management Systems Conference 2014, Jeju, South Korea; Kohonen, T., The Self-Organizing Map (1998) Neurocomputing, 21 (1-3), pp. 1-6; Kostoff, R.N., Boylan, R., Simons, G.R., Disruptive Technology Roadmaps (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 141-159; Lee, S., Lee, S., Seol, H., Park, Y., Using Patent Information for Designing New Product and Technology: Keyword Based Technology Roadmapping (2008) R&D Management, 38 (2), pp. 169-188; Martin, H., Daim, T., Technology Roadmapping through Intelligence Analysis: Case of Nanotechnology (2008) International Journal of Society Systems Science, 1 (1), pp. 49-66; Mendonça, S., Cardoso, G., Caraça, J., The Strategic Strength of Weak Signal Analysis (2012) Futures, 44 (3), pp. 218-228; Morris, S., DeYong, C., Wu, Z., Salman, S., Yemenu, D., DIVA: A Visualization System for Exploring Document Databases for Technology Forecasting (2002) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 43 (4), pp. 841-862; Paap, J., Katz, R., Anticipating Disruptive Innovation (2004) IEEE Engineering Management Review, 32 (4), pp. 74-85; Pang, A.S.K., Futures 2.0: Rethinking the Discipline (2010) Foresight, 12 (1), pp. 5-20; Park, H., Kim, K., Choi, S., Yoon, J., A Patent Intelligence System for Strategic Technology Planning (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (7), pp. 2373-23790; Phaal, R., Farrukh, C.J.P., Probert, D.R., Technology Roadmapping – A Planning Framework for Evolution and Revolution (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 5-26; Rossel, P., Weak Signals as a Flexible Framing Space for Enhanced Management and Decision-Making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21 (3), pp. 307-320; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The Big Picture – Trends, Drivers, Wild Cards, Discontinuities and Weak Signals (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 292-312; Schatzmann, J., Schäfer, R., Eichelbaum, F., Foresight 2.0 – Definition, Overview & Evaluation (2013) European Journal of Futures Research, 1 (1), pp. 1-15; Shneiderman, B., Dunne, C., Sharma, P., Wang, P., Innovation Trajectories for Information Visualizations: Comparing Treemaps, Cone Trees, and Hyperbolic Trees (2012) Information Visualization, 11 (2), pp. 87-105; Vesanto, J., Himberg, J., (1999), “Self-Organizing Map in Matlab: The SOM Toolbox.” The Matlab DSP Conference 1999, 35–40.

Damselflies and dragonflies show a variety of parasitism patterns, but large-scale comparative immune defence studies are rare, and it is difficult to say what the interplay is between their immune defence and parasitism. The aim of this study was to find whether there are differences in immune response between different damselfly and dragonfly species and whether these could explain their levels of gregarine and water mite parasitism. Using an artificial pathogen, a piece of nylon filament, we measured the encapsulation response of 22 different damselfly and dragonfly species and found that (i) there are significant encapsulation differences between species, (ii) body mass has a strong association with encapsulation and parasite prevalences, (iii) body mass shows a strong phylogenetic signal, whereas encapsulation response and gregarine and water mite prevalences show weak signals, and (iv) associations between the traits are affected by phylogeny. We do not know what the relationship is between these four traits, but it seems clear that phylogeny plays a role in determining parasitism levels of damselflies and dragonflies. © 2016 The Authors.","Encapsulation; Host–parasite associations; Immune defence; Insect; Parasitism",,,,,,"González-Santoyo, I., Córdoba-Aguilar, A., Phenoloxidase: A key component of the insect immune system: Biochemical and evolutionary ecology of PO (2012) Entomol.

The objective of the present work is to determine weaker coherent and non-coherent signals with low Signal-to-Ratio (SNR) in heavily faded areas, where performances of other conventional algorithms are not good. For the determination of weaker signal accurately, a combined method using Blind Source Separation (BSS) based Joint Approximation Diagonalisation of Eigen matrices (JADE) and Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is used. From simulated results, it is found that the resolution of MUSIC algorithm can be enhanced using this combined method. Also the capability of detection of angle of incoming signal can be enhanced using this proposed method. Since, smart antenna system is one of the main technologies in fourth generation mobile communication and beyond, the proposed method may be useful for next generation mobile communication.","Blind source separation; Coherent and non-coherent signals; Direction of arrival; Multiple signal classification; Smart antenna",,,,,,"Okamoto, G.T., (2002) Smart antennas and wireless LANS, , Kluwer Academic Publishers.

However, due to the increasing turbulence and dynamic complexity that characterize today’s competitive arenas, such systems need to be combined with simulation-based methodologies in order to improve entrepreneurial learning processes and, as a result, better detect possible crisis symptoms and weak signals of change—emerging from the business environment—to promptly react. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to show how a combination of traditional management control mechanisms with system dynamics modelling can effectively lead to better results in terms of SMEs’ performance measurement and management. As a result, a Dynamic Performance Management approach will be illustrated and discussed, also through an empirical application to a real small business. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Case-study; Dynamic Performance Management; Management control; Simulation; SMEs; System dynamics modelling",,,,,,"Bianchi, C., Introducing SD modeling into planning & control systems to manage SMEs growth: A learning-oriented perspective.

In this paper, we present a new gap filling strategy for 3D vascular networks. The novelty of our approach is to combine both skeleton- and intensity-based information to fill large discontinuities. Our approach also does not make any hypothesis on the network topology, which is particularly important for tumour vasculature due to the chaotic arrangement of vessels within tumours. Synthetic results show that using intensity-based information, in addition to skeleton-based information, can make the detection of large discontinuities more robust. Our strategy is also shown to outperform a classic gap filling strategy on 3D Micro-CT images of preclinical tumour models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Complex networks; Computerized tomography; Filling; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Musculoskeletal system; Tumors; Complex morphology; Gap filling; Micro CT; Network topology; Vascular network; Vasculature; Weak signals; Information use",,,,,"Bauer, C., Pock, T., Sorantin, E., Bischof, H., Beichel, R., Segmentation of interwoven 3d tubular tree structures utilizing shape priors and graph cuts (2010) Medical Image Analysis, 14, pp. 172-184; Bekkers, E., Duits, R., Berendschot, T., ter Haar Romeny, B., A Multi-Orientation Analysis Approach to Retinal Vessel Tracking (2014) J.

Such questions arise particularly when it comes down to making strategic decisions. To help with these questions, this book defines the concept of the ""weak signal"" and then demonstrates how it would be useful in relation to strategic decisions, and more precisely in relation to three moments of the strategic decision, i.e.: - The trigger of the strategic decision (what is the trigger, why and when) - The development of the strategic decision - The implementation of the strategic decision. © ISTE Ltd 2014.

Limitation of coherent combining time is overcome by block accumulation of demodulated GPS intermediate frequency data. Based on FFT frequency shift characteristics, a Doppler circular frequency search is used to achieve low computation instead of frequency compensation search. Loss in frequency is resolved by different down conversions. Compared to the original non-coherent combining, SNR is improved by differential-coherent combining of coherent results. Weak signal in a 39dB poor SNR environment is successfully acquired in experiments. High sensitivity and operation efficiency of the proposed algorithm are confirmed by experiment results. © 2014 IEEE.","Acquisition; Compass; GPS; Satellite receiver; Weak signal","Compasses (magnetic); Fast Fourier transforms; Global positioning system; Signal analysis; Signal receivers; Acquisition; Coherent combining; Differential coherent; Frequency compensation; Intermediate frequency datum; Operation efficiencies; Satellite receivers; Weak signals; Signal processing",,,,,"Gleason, S., Gebre-Egziabher, D., (2009) GNSS Applications and Methods, , Artech House; Tsui, J.B.-Y., (2004) Fundamentals of Global Positioning System Receivers a Software Approach, , 2nd ed.

Recently, in order to improve indoor performance, femtocell networks have been receiving a great deal of attention. However, since the femtocell and macrocell share the same frequency band, co-channel interference (CCI) between them is one of serious problems in femtocell networks. In order to reduce co-channel interference, this paper proposes a novel CCI avoidance scheme using the control channel information based on location information for the downlink of Long Term Evolution (LTE) femtocell networks. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of the outage probability and system throughput. © 2014 IEEE.","OFDMA; LTE; femtocell networks; interference mitigation; control channel information; location information","Broadband networks; Cochannel interference; Codes (symbols); Femtocell; Frequency bands; Frequency division multiple access; Interference suppression; Wireless telecommunication systems; Co-channel interference mitigations; Cochannel interference (CCI); Femtocell Networks; Femtocell systems; Interference mitigation; Location information; Outage probability; System throughput; Mobile telecommunication systems",,,,,"http://www.femtoforum.org; Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J., Gatherer, A., Femtocell networks: A survey (2008) Proc.

The proposed method uses batch mode to improve capture gain by adopting Doppler compensation and improves signal accumulate time tolerance. Moreover, the method can further improve the signal capture sensitivity. Comparing with traditional algorithm the capture probability rises greatly and it is proved by lots of simulation tests.

The main reasons of link failures are mobility, interference and congestion. Mobility means each node is free to move within its transmission range. Interference occurs due to collision and hidden node. Hidden node means two nodes out of each other's radio range, simultaneously try to transmit data to an intermediate node, which is in radio range of both the sending nodes. None of the sending nodes will be aware of the other node's transmission, causing a collision to occur at the intermediate node. Hidden node interference problem can be solved by using the RTS-CTS handshake method of 802.11 MAC. Signal strength is considered as cross layer interaction parameter. Received signal strength is taken from physical layer and is checked at MAC layer whether it is above certain threshold. If it is above threshold then link is strong, otherwise weak link, which can cause route failure. When a route is likely to fail due to weak signal strength of a node, it will find alternate path. AODV has better congestion avoidance mechanisms. This paper addresses four signal strength based congestion control mechanisms AODV, Reliable AODV, MAODV, CLS-AODV. © 2012 IEEE.","AODV (Adhoc On demand Distance Vector); Cross layer approach; MANET; Signal strength","802.11 MAC; Ad hoc on demand distance vector; Alternate path; Congestion avoidance; Congestion control mechanism; Cross-layer approach; Cross-layer interaction; Hidden nodes; Interference problems; Intermediate node; Link failures; MAC layer; MANET; Physical layers; Radio range; Received signal strength; Route failure; Signal strengths; Transmission ranges; Transmit data; Weak links; Weak signals; Network layers; Communication",,,,,"Lemma, F., Ye, Z., Krishnamurthy, S.V., Tripathi, S.K., (1996) Improving TCP Performance in Ad Hoc Networks Using Signal Strength Based Link Management, 1, pp. 98-104; Ramachandran, B., Shanmugavel, S., Impact of Node Density on Cross Layer Design for Reliable Route Discovery in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks; A cross-layer stability-based routing mechanism for ultra wideband networks (2010) Li-Na Wing, Jibe Yang Computer Communications, 33, pp. 2185-2194; Perkins, C.E., Royer, E.M., Das, S.R., Ad hoc on demand distance vector routing protocol (2003) IETF RFC 3651, , July; Marina, M.K., Das, S.R., On-demand multipath distance vector routing in ad hoc networks (2001) International Conference on Network Protocols, pp. 14-23; Oaken, K., Lertwatechakul, M., An improvement of ad hoc route maintenance International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT 2008); Perkins, C.E., Belding-Royer, E.M., Chokers, I., Ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing (2003) IETF Internet Draft, , Oct; Abolhasan, M., Winsock, T., Dutkiewicz, E., A review of routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (2004) Elsevier Ad Hoc Networks Journal, 2 (1), pp. 1-22; Shankar, C., Sankaranarayanan, V., A cross layer design for route maintenance in dense MANETs (2011) International Journal of Information Technology and Knowledge Management, 4 (2), pp. 539-543. , July-December; Song, W., Fang, F., Routing with congestion control using cross-layer design in wireless mesh network (2006) ICWMMN; Fu, Z., Zeros, P., Lou, H., Lu, S., Zhang, L., The impact of multihop wireless channel on TCP throughput and loss Mario Gela UCLA Computer Science Department, pp. 90095-1596. , Los Angeles, CA; Ramahandran, B., Shanmugavel, S., Reliable route discovery for mobile ad-hoc networks (2006) Proc of IETE International Conf. on Next Generation Networks, pp. 261-266. , Mumbai, India; Ramachandran, B., Shanmugavel, S., Impact of Node Density on Cross Layer Design for Reliable Route Discovery in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks; Romanowicz, E.W.A., TCP with Explicit Link Failure Notification; Shankar, C., Sankaranarayanan, V., A cross layer design for route maintenance in dense MANETs International Journal of Information Technology and Knowledge Management July-December 2011, 4 (2), pp. 539-543","Nandgave-Usturge, S.; G.

The Fetal signals are buried in other interference signals. Extracting FECG from the strong background interference has an important value in clinical application. ICA is a method for separating blind signals based on signal statistic characteristics. In this paper, the fundamental, discrimination condition and practical algorithm of Independent Component Analysis are discussed. Then, a fast Independent Component Analysis algorithm (FastICA) is introduced. But like FastICA, its convergence is dependent in initial weight. By importing loose gene in the algorithm, the new algorithm could implement convergence in large-scale. By modifying kernel iterate course, several iterations of FastICA are merged into one iteration of Modified FastICA, so the convergence of ICA will be accelerated. Finally, Modified ICA is applied to FECG extraction. The simulation shows that using the improved algorithm convergence speed can be increased. © 2012 IEEE.","BSS; EEG; FastICA; FECG; ICA","Algorithm convergence; Blind signals; Clinical application; Fast independent component analysis; FastICA; FECG; Fetal electrocardiograms; Important value; Initial weights; Interference signal; Maternal ECG; Signal statistics; Surface electrode; Weak signals; Algorithms; Blind source separation; Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography; Fuzzy systems; Iterative methods; Signal processing; Independent component analysis",,,,,"Gruber, P., Meyer-Bäse, A., Foo, S., ICA, kernel methods and nonnegativity: New paradigms for dynamical component analysis of fMRI data (2009) Institute for Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, pp. 497-504; Yang, F., Hong, B., (2006) Principles and Applications of ICA; Hyvǎrinen, A., Karhunen, J., Erkki, O., Independent Component Analysis, , ISBNs:0-471-40540-X (Hardback); 0-471-22131-7(Electronic); Hyvaerinen, A., Karhunen, J., Oja, E., (2001) Independent Component Analysis, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York; Hyvaerinen, A., Oja, E., Independent component analysis: Algorithm and application (2000) Neural Networks, 13 (4-5), pp. 411-430. , June; http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/ica/fastica/; Ma, J., Niu, Y., Chen, H., (2006) Blind Signal Processing, , National Defense Industry Press","Jin, H.; Department of Medical Device, Guangdong Food and Drug Vocational College, Guangzhou, China",,,,"2012 9th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2012","29 May 2012 through 31 May 2012","Chongqing",95177,,9781467300223,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Design/methodology/approach: Built upon the concept of the systemic foresight methodology, the Scan-4-Light approach involves the integrated use of horizon scanning, network analysis and evolutionary scenarios combined with expert consultations and workshops. The study identified the emerging trends, issues, weak signals and wild cards; created high-value visualisations to emphasize the results and findings; and produced narratives to increase the impact and awareness of the development issues. Findings: The Scan-4-Light project has resulted in a large number of specific outputs, providing the views of the Searchlight newsletters' contents at various levels of granularity. It has set out to show how the tools used here can be applied to illustrate the relationships among issues, and how these vary across countries and regions over time, and are linked to various stakeholders and possible solutions to problems. Research limitations/implications: Scan-4-Light demonstrates how foresight tools and techniques can be used for the analysis of complex and uncertain issues, such as development and poverty, in a systemic way. Practical implications: The Scan-4-Light approach can be applied in a number of areas for scanning and identifying emerging trends and issues, and understanding the relationships between systems and solutions. Social implications: The paper gives evidence that most of the issues, if not all, related to development are not isolated, but interlinked and interconnected. They require more holistic understanding and intervention with an effective collaboration between stakeholders.

Design/methodology/approach - The main method applied is critical thinking combined with a review of selected aspects of complexity theory and a general experience of applying foresight. Several new and practical implications for foresight techniques and their application are derived. Promoting variation is examined as one way to make policies more resilient in a complex system. Findings - Complexity science demonstrates that disruptive events do not need an associated trigger, as they are a normal part of a complex system. This insight implies that if we are always looking for weak signals we will certainly be caught unawares. Practical implications - The assumption that disruptive events can be managed by planning and forecasting is not a workable option. Instead, policy making needs to assume that unexpected disruptive events will happen even with the best horizon scanning system in place. Foresight techniques need to be developed to embrace emergence and to provide capabilities such as reframing to visualise systems from very different perspectives, including those considered impossible now.

The reason for spectral noise and its influence factors are discussed. Since some weak signals are inundated with the spectral noise, the method for amplitude damping based on least square technique is used to suppress the strong signals and spectral noise effectively. The weak signal is detected successfully in the simulation experiment and its amplitude is one hundred million times smaller than the strong one. The parameters of the components of nonuniformly sampled signal can be estimated with high accuracy.","Least square method; Nonuniform sampling; Spectrum analysis; Weak signal detection",,,,,,"Shannon, C.E., Communication in the presence of noise (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE, 86 (2), pp. 447-457; Margolis, E., Eldar, Y.C., Nonuniform sampling of periodic bandlimited signals (2008) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 56 (7), pp. 2728-2745; Maciejewski, M.W., Qui, H.Z., Rujan, I., Nonuniform sampling and spectral aliasing (2009) Journal of Magnetic Resonance, 199 (1), pp. 88-93; Wang, A., Wang, S., Chen, M., A novel spectrum analysis method for nonuniform periodically samping (2005) Signal Processing, 21 (3), pp. 240-243; Wang, A., Chen, L., Spectrum analysis and signal processing system of nonuniform sampling signal (2006) Application of Electronic Technique, 32 (11), pp. 118-120; Lomb, N.R., Least-squares frequency analysis of unequally spaced data (1976) Astrophysics and Space Science, 39, pp. 447-462; Ouderaa, E.V.D., Renneboog, J., Some formulas and applications of nonuniform sampling of bandwidth-limited signals (1998) IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 37 (3), pp. 353-357; Liu, L., Xie, J., Zhang, J., A lind of reconstruction method for non-uniform sampling signal (2001) Signal Processing, 17 (6), pp. 543-546; Xu, C., Wang, T., Wang, Z., Nonuniform sampling weak signal detection in frequency domain based on ICA (2007) Journal of Tianjin University, 40 (12), pp. 1463-1469; Wang, A., Wang, S., Chen, M., A novel method for signal detection based on nonuniform sampling (2004) Signal Processing, 20 (5), pp. 436-440; Wang, A., Chen, L., Weak signal detection and recovery from nonuniform samples using notch filter (2009) Signal Processing, 25 (1), pp. 18-21; Venkataramani, R., Bresler, Y., Optimal sub-Nyquist nonuniform sampling and reconstruction for multiband signals (2001) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 49 (10), pp. 2301-2313; Jacob, M., Optimized non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) for iterative tomographic reconstruction (2009) ICASSP' 09 Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 673-676. , Washington DC, USA: IEEE Computer Society; Chen, H., Liu, H., Li, D., Application of nonuniformly sampling and least square technique in interharmonic measurement (2009) Proceeding of the CSEE, 29 (10), pp. 109-114","Li, J.; State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400030, China; email: ljc@cqu.edu.cn",,,,,,,,10049037,,SCYCE,,"Chinese","Shu Ju Cai Ji Yu Chu Li",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864089646

The response proposed here is that many of the developments identified by efforts to detect and interpret weak signals are the result of designed interventions that define the repertoire of actions and frames. Very often, as Ansoff argued, actors use a variety of models and filters for seeking and using weak signals. Thus weak signals are not only dependent on the interpretative equipment applied by actors, but from a constructivist perspective the identification of and meaning given to weak signals are strongly influenced by design choices made at the outset. In this sense design is a constitutive element of both the environment and signal detection/use. An example of how design is constitutive of both context and understanding can be found in the history of hospital hygiene. This case study illustrates how dominant regimes of practice, established through the conception of pathogen bacteria and antibacterial treatments and disinfection, are now creating signals that call into question fundamental design of hygiene practices. By examining the epistemic assumptions of scientific disciplines and the designed repertoire of practical responses it becomes clear how contexts and frames of interpretation are constituted and how such contexts and frames then define what is recognised as a weak signal. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"design method; disinfection; environmental response; hospital sector; hygiene; modeling; planning method; signal",,,,,"Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Goffman, E., (1974) Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience, , Harper and Row; Bruno, B., (1988) The Pasteurization of France, , Belknap Press; Jørgensen, M.S., Lindegaard, H., Hygiene in a Historical Perspective (2007) Hygiejne i et historisk perspektiv, , Institut for Produktion og Ledelse, DTU; Latour, B., Woolgar, S., (1988) Laboratory Life - The Construction of Scientific Facts, , Princeton University Press; Weick, K.E., (1996) Sensemaking in Organizations, , Sage Publications; Simon, H., (1969) The Sciences of the Artificial, , MIT Press; Cross, N., (2007) Designerly Ways of Knowing, , Springer; Ministry of Science, Technology and Development (2004) Teknologisk fremsyn om hygiejne - Forkningspolitisk handlingsplan; Smith, L.H., Kristensen, J.E., Light, Fresh Air and Cleanliness - Birth of the Modern Social Hygiene (1986) Lys, luft og renlighed - Den moderne social-hygiejnes fødsel, , Akademisk Forlag; Semmelweis, I., Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers , 3, p. 2008. , 1861, republished as: The Etiology, Concept, and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever, Social Medicine; Boyce, J.M., Pittet, D., Guidelines for hand hygiene in health-care setting: recommendations for the healthcare infection control practices and advisory committee and hand hygiene task force (2002) Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 23 (12), pp. S3-S41; Latour, B., (1987) Science in Action - How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society, , Harward University Press; Pinch, T., Oudshorn, N., (2007) How Users Matter, , MIT Press; Bijker, W.E., (2002) Of Bicycles, Bakelites and Bulbs - Toward a Theory of Sociotechnical Change, , MIT Press; (1996) Making Technology Our Own?

The least we can say is that it has not been easy. Though this complexity lessens when measuring specific features for local appraisal goals or benchmarking them within a broader framework, measurement of the socio-economic value of ICTs is particularly controversial. Here the challenge is not only to count possessions, connections or usages, but assess to what extent ICT investments trigger new valued added and increase overall performance. This paper aims to highlight various types of measuring contributions, putting them in perspective within a new paradigmatic requirement. More specifically, we claim that ICTs can only be ""measured"" when the measuring objective and context are coupled with: 1. reflexive questioning (how do we know that we know what we know regarding ICT efficiency and effectiveness?), and 2. modelling design and research (how do we represent that efficiency and effectiveness, with what computing modelling techniques and within which kind of assumption and theoretical debates?). After examining traditional views on ICT measurement, this paper suggests some concrete steps forward in measuring-modelling and discusses the most promising ways to tackle grand challenge level issues (ICT impact is not about small improvements only). The paper builds upon the hypothesis that there is a need to develop meta-measuring and multi-modelling approaches which address macro-economic needs as well as micro-economic indications. The paper concludes by outlining how user-driven dynamics and broader transformational signals can lead us to a better understanding and measurement of critical Information Society dynamics such as participation and democracy, computer literacy and wellbeing, governance and inclusion to mention just a few.

The field of the information design (ID) applies to the process of translating complex, unorganized or unstructured data into valuable and meaningful information. ID practice requires an interdisciplinary approach, which combines skills in graphic design (writing, analysis processing and editing), human performances technology and human factors. Applied in the context of information system, it allows end-users to easily detect implicit topics known as ""weak signals"" (WS). In our approach to implement the ID, the processes cover the development of a knowledge management (KM) process in the context of EI. A case study concerning information monitoring health resources is presented using ID processes to outline weak signals. Both French and American bibliographic databases were applied to make the connection to multilingual concepts in the health watch process.","Business intelligence; Economic intelligence; Information design; Weak signals",,,,,,"(2010), http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/tlfiv5/advanced.exe?8;s=66859215, ATILF - CNRS, Université Nancy 2, Le Trésor de la Langue française [visIted date: Nov. 20, 2010]; Ansoff, H.I., (1975) Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals, 18 (2), pp. 21-33. , California Management Review; Ansoff, H.I., ""Strategic response in turbulent environments"" (1985) Handbook of business strategy; Card, S., Mackinlay, J., Shneiderman, B., (1999) Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think, , (Eds).

Despite many sophisticated defense techniques, attacks continue to increase. At present, in order to hide the source of the attack, many attackers prefer a stepping stone to launch their attack due to the anonymous nature of the Internet. The size, header and content of an IP packet will be changed because of the stepping stone and all these changes make it more difficult to trace the source of attacks. Currently, researchers study the time interval between IP packets and embed the watermark into the packet stream by adjusting the time interval between IP packets to trace the source of attacks. In this paper we study the previous watermarking schemes based on inter packet delay and propose a novel watermark scheme based on the rate of packets. For the first time we used weak signal detection model and cluster technology to resume the watermark, so as to avoid the present schemes which are based on precision time synchronization or packet number. Simulation tests show that the novel watermark is robust and can countermine the time perturbation, packet losing perturbation and packet padding perturbation caused by an attacker on purpose. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","IPD; Stepping stone; Watermark","Cluster technology; Defense techniques; Internet users; Interpacket delays; IP packets; IPD; Network-based; New approaches; Packet numbers; Packet streams; Simulation tests; Stepping stone; Time interval; Time synchronization; Traceback; Watermark; Watermark scheme; Watermarking schemes; Weak signal detection; Cellular radio systems; Internet; Internet protocols; Security systems; Watermarking; Security of data",,,,,"Sekar, V., Xie, Y., Maltz, D., Reiter, M., Zhang, H., Toward a framework for internet forensic analysis (2004) Proc. of ACM HotNets-III; Yaar, A., Perrig, A., Song, D., FIT: Fast internet traceback (2005) Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2005. 24th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies, 2; Strayer, W., Jones, C., Schwartz, B., Mikkelson, J., Livadas, C., Technol, B., Cambridge, M., Architecture for multi-stage network attack traceback (2005) The IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks, 2005, p. 8. , 30th Anniversary; Wang, X., Reeves, D., Wu, S., Inter-packet delay based correlation for tracing encrypted connections through stepping stones (2002) ESORICS 2002, 2502, pp. 244-263. , Gollmann, D.

Based on this segmentation, in a merchandising situation, one can interact with the customer to identify the segment to which the customer belongs and in turn offer the proper product and merchandising. Design/methodology/approach: The study deals with the creation of new hair products, using both ideation by brand Delphi™ and by experimental design of ideas with conjoint measurement (IdeaMap.Net). It ends with the creation of a merchandising product for hair coloring based on concept segmentation. First the internet was used to facilitate the acquisition and prioritization of new ideas. Then the experimental design of ideas was used to identify which perform well in the body of test concepts. Findings: Three segments were identified: Segment 1 (54 percent) wants easy to use, high technology, and reliable products. Segment 2 (25 percent) wants to give, and get information about themselves, with respect to hair coloring. Furthermore, they want to make information giving/getting a process, not simply a rapid 1-2-3 affair. Segment 3 (21 percent) wants results. They want information, primarily what the product will do for them, what it delivers. Research limitations/implications: The innovative research deals with the creation of ""new to the world"" product ideas and the segmentation of respondents into different groups, based on their mind-sets. Practical implications: The segmentation results provide the manufacturer and the trade with an opportunity to fine-tune the development of the new product and its merchandising. One of the recurring questions, however, is how to find these segments in the population? Data mining works by searching for assignment rules that put people into the segments based on a decision rule. The variables used by the decision rule come from external information about the respondent, which the respondent may have provided previously, or patterns of purchases that the individual may have made over time. The objective is to increase the chances of correctly classifying a new individual as a member of one of the three segments, and by so doing present the prospect with a better offer, whether an improved product or shopping experience.

This scheme can show all details except the private key. After the watermarking scheme is described, the model feasibility experiment and anti-attack ability experiments are made and discussed. Experimental and discussion results show that the scheme is robust enough against attacks of the commonly used image processing methods. Also, experimental results show that the algorithm is robust to malicious attacks. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Chaotic systems; Circuit oscillations; Image processing; Signal processing; Watermarking; Chaos systems; Chaotic oscillators; Detection methods; Feasibility experiments; Image processing - methods; Image Watermarking; Malicious attacks; Private keys; Public keys; Robust watermarking schemes; Watermarking schemes; Weak signal detections; Weakness signal detections; Signal detection",,,,,"Furon, T., Duhamel, P., An asymmetric watermarking method (2003) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 51 (4), pp. 981-995; Pan, J.S., Huang, H.C., Jain, L.C., Fang, W.C., (2007) Intelligent Multimedia Data Hiding, , New Directions.

In this paper, a new method, which combines the Adaptive Redundant Second-Generation Wavelet (ARSGW) and the Hilbert transform, is proposed. The ARSGW is applied to reveal the transient components of the signal in time domain clearly. Then the Hilbert transform is used to extract fault features of rolling bearing from the wavelet packets. The analysis results of the vibration signals from the experiment and the machine tool spindle show that the proposed method can detect the faults of the rolling bearing effectively.

In many ICA-based de-noising processing, however, they need noise-free source data to train the basis vectors as a priori knowledge. The noise-free data is always not acquirable in practice. In this paper, the generalized Gaussian model (GGM) is proposed as the p.d.f. estimator in ICA to extract the basis vectors directly from the noisy observation, since GGM can easily characterize a wide class of non-Gaussian statistical distributions. Simultaneously, the distribution of the coefficients learned by GGM is benefit for obtaining the shrinkage functions. The de-nosing experiments of noisy speech signals show that the proposed method is more efficient than conventional methods in the environment of additive white Gaussian noise. It demonstrates that the proposed method offer an efficient approach for detecting weak signals from the noise environment. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Extraction; Feature extraction; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Pattern recognition; White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; Conventional methods; Generalized Gaussian models; Noise environments; Noisy observations; Noisy speech signals; Shrinkage functions; Statistical distribution; Independent component analysis",,,,,"Hyvärinen, A., Sparse code shrinkage: Denoising of nongaussian data by maximum likelihood estimation (1998) Technical Report, A51. , Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Computer and Information Science; Lee, T.-W., Jang, G.-J., The Statistical Structures of Male and Female Speech Signals (2001) Proc.

In this method, the received time series is assumed to be composed of some kind of an unknown chaotic signal and very weak harmonics. Thus, the local-geometric-projection method of noise reduction for a chaotic signal can be applied, and, as a result, the purified chaotic signal and the residual error sequences are obtained. The residual error sequences contain most of the weak signals and are modeled as an autoregressive moving average process, and frequencies of the harmonics are resolved. The principles of the approach and the algorithm employed are described in detail. The optimal selection of the algorithm parameters such as the length of the received data, the embedding dimension, and the number of nearest-neighbor points are also discussed. Some simulations of extracting the weak signals with various amplitudes and frequencies from strong chaotic interference are made. Excellent results are achieved from these computer simulations indicating the high effectiveness of the approach.","Chaotic dynamics theory; Chaotic interference; Communication; Harmonic signal; Signal extraction","Algorithms; Chaos theory; Computer simulation; Signal interference; Harmonic signals; Signal processing",,,,,"Abarbanel, H.D.I., (1996) Analysis of Observed Chaotic Data, , Springer, New York; Cawley, R., Hsu, G.H., Local-geometric-projection method for noise reduction in chaotic maps and flows (1992) Phys.

These attributes, which may be time-varying (dynamic) or time-invariant (static), can be anything that are relevant to the physical processes that produce the measurements. In statistical signal processing, imperfections or uncertainties in the physical processes are described using probability models, and the complete probabilistic solution to the problem is given by the distribution of the attributes conditioned on all available measurements (the posterior distribution). We describe an algorithm for computing this solution, especially in situations with many measurements or low signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm combines sequential importance sampling (SIS) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) so as to achieve computational efficiency and stability. MCMC is performed sequentially for batches of measurements whose sizes are determined adaptively, hence the name sequential MCMC filter. For measurements within a batch, SIS is performed. Thus, bigger batch sizes mean that MCMC is performed less frequently. SIS is computationally efficient but with a finite Monte Carlo sample size, stability is not guaranteed indefinitely. MCMC is therefore needed from time to time to ""refresh"" the Monte Carlo sample, eliminating any errors that may have accumulated from the SIS steps. When MCMC is performed, it does not start from scratch but uses the most recent Monte Carlo sample from SIS to construct the proposal distribution. Adaptive batch sizing is based on a Kullback-Leibler distance that is easy to compute. By extending the algorithm to multiple models, the sequential MCMC filter can deal simultaneously with the dual pillars of statistical signal processing, namely detection (more generally, model selection) and parameter estimation. We discuss general uses of the sequential MCMC filter, and demonstrate its use for simultaneous weak signal detection and parameter estimation in a real-data experiment.",,"Algorithms; Computational methods; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Probability; Problem solving; Sampling; Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Sequential importance sampling (SIS); Digital filters",,,,,"Cappe, O., Robert, C.P., Markov chain Monte Carlo: 10 Years and still running!

The specific problem considered here arises in monitoring nuclear tests and nuclear treaty compliance, where the presence of ubiquitous background noise obscures the seismic signals associated with the tests. The problem is that the signal from a distant teleseismic event can be attenuated so that it is lost in the background noise, and since the noise overlaps the frequency band occupied by the teleseisms, frequency-based techniques provide only marginal improvements in detection capabilities. For the work in this paper, we studied a test set of actual seismic sensor data prepared by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). The data set was composed of background seismic noise which contained or had added to it a number of hidden teleseismic signals. This data was analyzed to determine if techniques of NLD forecasting could be used to detect the hidden signals. For this test case, it was possible to predict the behavior of the seismic background sufficiently well that when the predicted background behavior was removed, the hidden signals became evident. However, some of the weaker signals were very close to the residual noise level, so the ability to detect these events is compromised.",,,,,,,"Abarbanel, H.D.I., Kennel, M.B., Local false nearest neighbors and dynamical dimensions from observed chaotic data (1993) Phys.

High-sensitivity and low-cost pressure sensors are the primary requirement in practical application. Herein, a convenient and low-cost process to fabricate a bionic fish-scale structure poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) film via air/water interfacial formation technique is presented. High-sensitivity flexible pressure sensors can be constructed by assembling conductive films of graphene nanosheets into a microstructured film. Thanks to the unique fish-scale structures of PDMS films, the prepared pressure sensor shows excellent performance with high sensitivity (-70.86% kPa -1 ). In addition, our pressure sensors can detect weak signals, such as wrist pulses, respiration, and voice vibrations. Moreover, the whole process of pressure sensor preparation is cost-effective, eco-friendly, and controllable.

The significant challenges arise when the operating standards use overlapping frequency bands. Co-channel interference (CCI) is one of such challenges which have been in focus of the cellular communication community, but not in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) radio bands where multiple heterogeneous wireless standards operate without a centralized coordination. Recognizing Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) as one of the proven mechanisms to mitigate CCI, we propose methods to improve Packet Error Rate (PER) of wideband OFDM-based systems in the presence of multiple cochannel narrowband interferers. Our methods achieve improvements in PER statistics at lower received power level compared to conventional methods. Reduction in PER of the dominant OFDM signal makes more packets available for regeneration and hence cancellation during SIC procedure which aides the decoding of weaker signal. We also propose a simple yet efficient method to detect the presence and positioning of multiple narrowband interferers. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations show that our methods elevate a receiver sensitivity gain up to 6 dB and are capable of detecting multiple narrowband interferers simultaneously. Our methods require modifications in the physical layer of the receiver only and hence can be integrated into existing infrastructure. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Cochannel interference; Decoding; Europium compounds; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Network layers; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Software radio; Cochannel interference (CCI); Communication community; Conventional methods; Narrowband interferers; Received Power Levels; Receiver sensitivity; Software-defined radios; Successive interference cancellation(SIC); Nitrogen compounds",,,,,"github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11, Bastibl/Gr-ieee802-11.

The author defines innovations as ongoing processes of changes in the various fields of social and economic life, which result from human creative activity. Noting that innovation is an uncertain, relatively chaotic, and disordered process characterized by inherent risks, the author aims to define the most general and universal barriers impeding one's ability to recognize the signs of future innovation and to anticipate their consequences. Considering examples of ""disruptive innovation"" in the technological, social, political, and economic spheres of life, the author sees these innovations as arising from certain condition and events, not as simple random occurrences. Most of them are effects of particular causes. However, these causes are often hidden within events that are difficult to observe and phenomena encapsulated in weak signals. The inability to detect and recognize such pre-emerging warnings of upcoming innovations may be attributed to the massive amount of information and noise flooding today's world. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of knowledge, techniques, and experience for dealing with huge amounts of information, the lack of the required skills, and, finally, by human cognitive biases. Faced with this deluge of misinformation, any person can eventually be misled and make mistakes. This paper posits that, in order to mitigate such risks, an individual must avoid the three cognitive biases: the symmetry of delusions, aggressive neglect, and the curse of knowledge. These cognitive biases are the barriers to foreseeing innovation. © 2018 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

First, within each breeding pair of birds, one bird is homozygous for the standard arrangement of the chromosome (ZAL2/ZAL2) and its mate is heterozygous for a different version (ZAL2/ZAL2 m ). Second, recombination is profoundly suppressed between the two versions, leading to genetic differentiation between them. Third, the ZAL2 m version is linked with phenotypic traits, such as bright plumage, high aggression, and low parental behavior, which are usually associated with males. These similarities to sex chromosomes suggest that the evolutionary mechanisms that shape sex chromosomes, in particular genetic degeneration of the heterogametic version due to the suppression of recombination, are likely important in this system as well. Here, we investigated patterns of protein sequence evolution and gene expression evolution between the ZAL2 and ZAL2 m chromosomes by whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome analyses. Patterns of protein evolution exhibited only weak signals of genetic degeneration, and few genes harbored signatures of positive selection. We found substantial evidence of transcriptome evolution, such as significant expression divergence between ZAL2 and ZAL2 m alleles and signatures of dosage compensation for highly expressed genes. These results suggest that, early in the evolution of heteromorphic chromosomes, gene expression divergence and dosage compensation can prevail before large-scale genetic degeneration. Our results show further that suppression of recombination between heteromorphic chromosomes can lead to the evolution of alternative (sex-like) behavioral phenotypes before substantial genetic degeneration. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

The world is a complex system and the rapid change among its sub-systems builds up pressure for any efforts to anticipate change and shape the processes of transformation. Surprise is an intrinsic aspect of change, in particular when it takes place at an accelerating pace with high degrees of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity (VUCA) - or within the condition of post-normality as described by Ziauddin Sardar. Emerging technologies such as AI and renewable energy systems add to the complexity of societies, and thus to the world of VUCA and post-normality. In foresight horizon scanning has much focused on the probable or even predictable -surprise-free developments. More emphasis should be paid on systematic anticipation of wild cards and black swans, and on the analysis of weak signals. Foresight should also focus on discontinuities - broader phenomena and developments instead of single events. Energy is a complex issue. Without energy there is no life, neither biological nor economic. Taking into account the huge ecological and social costs of the present energy system, the need for a new emission-free, cost-effective, and democratised energy system is obvious. An energy transformation to reach 100% renewable energy is envisioned in four transformational neo-carbon energy scenarios. Energy is increasingly a societal and even cultural issue - above all a security issue. As regards energy security, various sudden events and surprises could play a major role. New energy systems themselves, with other new technologies, nudge the world into unknown, discontinuous directions. Therefore, we probe the resilience, anti-fragility and discontinuity of these transformational, societal energy scenarios. The results of a futures clinique where the scenarios were tested are presented. Implications of surprises for energy security, as the world increasingly seeks to move towards a renewable energy based society, are explored. © 2017, The Author(s).","Black swans; Complexity; Discontinuity; Energy security; Renewable energy; Resilience; Transformative scenarios; Turbulence; Uncertainty; Wild cards",,,,,,"Aven, T., Implications of black swans to the foundations and practice of risk assessment and management (2015) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 134, pp. 83-91; Aven, T., On the meaning of a black swan in a risk context (2013) Saf Sci, 57, pp. 44-51; Last, C., Human metasystem transition (HMST) theory (2015) J Evol Technol, 25 (1), pp. 1-16; Osti, G., Frames, organisations, and practices as social components of energy (2012) Int Rev Sociol, 22 (3), pp. 412-428; Lord, B., (2014) Art & Energy: how culture changes, , The AAM Press, Arlington; Naam, R., (2011) Smaller, cheaper, faster: Does Moore's law apply to solar cells?

Streaming event data are discrete observations occurring in continuous time, and the precise time interval between two events carries substantial information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. How does one promptly detect changes in these dynamic systems using these streaming event data? In this paper, we propose a novel change-point detection framework for multidimensional event data over networks. We cast the problem into a sequential hypothesis test, and we derive the likelihood ratios for point processes, which are computed efficiently via an expectation-maximization (EM) like algorithm that is parameter free and can be computed in a distributed manner. We derive a highly accurate theoretical characterization of the false-alarm rate, and we show that the method can provide weak signal detection by aggregating local statistics over time and networks. Finally, we demonstrate the good performance of our algorithm on numerical examples and real-world datasets from Twitter and Memetracker. © 2015 IEEE.","Change-point detection for event data; false alarm control; Hawkes process; online detection algorithm","Errors; Maximum principle; Signal detection; Change point detection; Discrete observations; Expectation Maximization; False alarms; Internet traffic monitoring; On-line detection; Real-world datasets; Weak signal detection; Continuous time systems",,,,,"Laptev, N., Amizadeh, S., Flint, I., Generic and scalable framework for automated time-series anomaly detection (2015) Proc. 21th ACM SIGKDD Int.

Existing inference procedures for penalized estimators are mainly focused on strong signals. In this paper, we propose an identification procedure for weak signals in finite samples, and provide a transition phase in-between noise and strong signal strengths. We also introduce a new two-step inferential method to construct better confidence intervals for the identified weak signals. Our theory development assumes that variables are orthogonally designed. Both theory and numerical studies indicate that the proposed method leads to better confidence coverage for weak signals, compared with those using asymptotic inference. In addition, the proposed method outperforms the perturbation and bootstrap resampling approaches.We illustrate our method for HIV antiretroviral drug susceptibility data to identify genetic mutations associated with HIV drug resistance.","Adaptive Lasso; Finite sample inference; Model selection; Weak signal",,,,,,"Andrews, D.W.K., Inconsistency of the bootstrap when a parameter is on the boundary of the parameter space (2000) Econometrica, 68, pp. 399-405. , MR1748009; Berk, R., Brown, L., Buja, A., Zhang, K., Zhao, L., Valid post-selection inference (2013) Ann.

This is because either some strong signals to the response are not included in working models or too many weak signals are excluded in the modeling stage, which make cumulative bias. Thus, estimating consistently the parameters of interest in biased working models is then a challenge. This paper investigates the estimation problem for linear transformation models with three aims. First, to identify strong signals in the original full models, a sufficient dimension reduction approach is applied to transferring linear transformation models to pro forma linear models. This method can efficiently avoid high-dimensional nonparametric estimation for the unknown model transformation. Second, after identifying strong signals, a semiparametric re-modeling with some artificially constructed predictors is performed to correct model bias in working models. The construction procedure is introduced and a ridge ratio estimation is proposed to determine the number of these predictors. Third, root-n consistent estimators of the parameters in working models are defined and the asymptotic normality is proved. The performance of the new method is illustrated through simulation studies and a real data analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Estimation consistency; Linear transformation models; Model bias correction; Non-sparse structure","Mathematical transformations; Parameter estimation; Regression analysis; Asymptotic normality; Construction procedures; Model bias; Model transformation; Non-parametric estimations; Root-n consistent estimators; Sufficient dimension reduction; Transformation model; Linear transformations",,,,,"Banerjee, S., Roy, A., Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics (2014), CRC Press; Belloni, A., Chernozhukov, V., Least squares after model selection in high-dimensional sparse models (2013) Bernoulli, 19, pp. 521-547; Feng, Z., Wang, T., Zhu, L.X., Transformation-based estimation (2014) Comput.

This paper aims to present results of this research. Design/methodology/approach: The study was based on a combination of technology-push and market-pull approaches that aimed not only to identify most promising science and technology (S&T) areas but also to understand how they can be realized in practice. Representatives from federal authorities, science and business were involved in the project to create future visions of technological directions; analyze grand challenges, weak signals and wild cards; and set research and development (R&D) priorities. Findings: According to results of the study, Russia has a potential for biotech sector development, although the level of R&D in the majority of areas is lagging behind that in the USA and leading EU countries. However, there are several advanced applied research areas where efforts can be focused. Among them are high-performance genomics and post-genomics research platforms, systems and structural biology, microbial metabolic engineering, plant biotechnology and microbial strains and consortia for development of symbiotic plant–microbial communities. Originality/value: Concentration of available resources of government and business on biotechnological sector development can help to find answers for challenges that Russia faces today or will face tomorrow. It will help to pick up on the current level of research activities, improve the quality of personnel training, make this area the engine of the economy and carry out the so-called new industrialization of the country, building a new, high-tech device industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bioeconomy; Biotechnologies; Foresight; Grand challenges; Innovative products; Long-term prognosis; Russia",,,,,,"Buyel, J.F., Process development strategies in plant molecular farming (2015) Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, 16 (11), pp. 966-982; Häggman, H., Raybould, A., Borem, A., Fox, T., Handley, L., Hertzberg, M., Lu, M.Z., McLean, M., Genetically engineered trees for plantation forests: key considerations for environmental risk assessment (2013) Plant Biotechnology Journal, 11 (7), pp. 785-798; Hartung, F., Schiemann, J., Precise plant breeding using new genome editing techniques: opportunities, safety and regulation in the EU (2014) Plant Journal, 78 (5), pp. 742-752; Hegde, K., Chandra, N., Sarma, S.J., Brar, S.K., Veeranki, V.D., Genetic engineering strategies for enhanced biodiesel production (2015) Molecular Biotechnology, 57 (7), pp. 606-624; Heux, S., Meynial-Salles, I., O’Donohue, M.J., Dumon, C., White biotechnology: state of the art strategies for the development of biocatalysts for biorefining (2015) Biotechnology Advances, 33 (8), pp. 1653-1670; Kilbane, J.J., II, Future applications of biotechnology to the energy industry (2016) Frontiers in Microbiology, , https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00086; Liang, P., Xu, Y., Zhang, X., Ding, C., Huang, R., Zhang, Z., Lv, J., Huang, J., CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes (2015) Protein & Cell, 6 (5), pp. 363-372; Mikova, N., Sokolova, A., Global technology trends monitoring: theoretical frameworks and best practices (2014) Foresight-Russia, 8 (4), pp. 64-83; (2016) Russia 2030: Science and Technology Foresight, , HSE, Moscow; (2016) Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects, , National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; (2015) Industrialization of Biology: A Roadmap to Accelerate the Advanced Manufacturing of Chemicals, , National Academies Press, Washington, DC; (2010) The Bioeconomy to 2030: Designing a Policy Agenda, , OECD, Paris; Pearce, D.W., Turner, R.K., (1989) Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore; Reen, F.J., Gutiérrez-Barranquero, J.A., Dobson, A.D., Adams, C., O’Gara, F., Emerging concepts promising new horizons for marine biodiscovery and synthetic biology (2015) Marine Drugs, 13 (5), pp. 2924-2954; Rossi, M., Bermudez, L., Carrari, F., Crop yield: challenges from a metabolic perspective (2015) Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 25, pp. 79-89; Siegert, M., Sitte, J., Galushko, A., Krüger, M., Starting up microbial enhanced oil recovery (2014) Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology, 142, pp. 1-94; Streltsova, E., Patent activity in biotechnology (2014) Foresight-Russia, 8 (1), pp. 52-65; (2015) Strategic Research Agenda, , Technological Platform Bioindustry and Bioresources, Moscow; (2012) State Programme for R&D development Order No̱ 2433-R of the 20th of December, 2012, , The Russian Government, Moscow; Verbeke, W., Sans, P., Van Loo, E., Challenges and prospects for consumer acceptance of cultured meat (2015) Journal of Integrative Agriculture, 14 (2), pp. 285-294; Weber, T., Charusanti, P., Musiol-Kroll, E.M., Jiang, X., Tong, Y., Kim, H.U., Lee, S.Y., Metabolic engineering of antibiotic factories: new tools for antibiotic production in actinomycetes (2015) Trends in Biotechnology, 33 (1), pp. 15-26; Yashveer, S., Singh, V., Kaswan, V., Kaushik, A., Tokas, J., Green biotechnology, nanotechnology and bio-fortification: perspectives on novel environment-friendly crop improvement strategies (2014) Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering Reviews, 30 (1-2), pp. 113-126","Grebenyuk, A.; Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge, National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: grebenyuk@hse.ru",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029871874

The authors attribute particular attention to implication for Russia, which is relatively better positioned regarding the availability of water resources. However, the country still faces challenges related to the protection of water resources, drinking water supply, water networks, consumption patterns, water discharge, treatment and re-use. The present study aims at identification and analysis of trends, factors and uncertainties in water supply, demand, use and re-use with a particular focus on sustainability of water systems; water use by households and industry; and new water services and products. Design/methodology/approach: Research methodology in this paper involves a horizon scanning exercise for the identification of the key trends, factors and uncertainties along with the identification of weak signals of future emerging trends and wild cards in the form of future surprises, shocks and other unexpected events that may disrupt the preservation of water resources and the future of the water sector. Trends characterize broad parameters for shifts in attitudes, climate, policies and business focus over periods of several years that usually have global reach. These are usually experienced by everyone and often in similar contexts. Trends may represent threats, opportunities or a mixture of them, identified through underlying processes, possible events and other future developments. Findings: A key systemic restriction of water use for the next decades both globally and in Russia relates to competition between agriculture, energy, manufacturing and household water use. Given that the amount of renewable water resources is almost fixed and even decreases because of pollution, circular economy solutions for water use will be required. Implications of the global trends identified in the study for Russia are dependent on the overall situation with water resources in the country. Russia has sufficient water supply: the overall intake of water for drinking and economic purposes in Russia amounts to 3 per cent of the total water resources, two-thirds of which are discarded back to water bodies. At the same time, there are substantial problems associated with the extremely uneven distribution of water resources across the country, as well as high “water intensity” of the Russian GDP. The Russian water sector is currently not very attractive for investors. Moreover, it has significantly less lobbying opportunities than other infrastructure sectors, and this complicates its institutional and financial positions. Meanwhile, there have been some positive changes with regard to activities with a short pay-off period. Originality/value: The paper offers one of the first studies on the future of Russian water resources with a focus on the water supply and sanitation sector. A comprehensive approach to trends identification (not found in other studies on Russian water resources) allowed authors to identify social, technological, environmental, economic, policy and value-related global trends and uncertainties.

Because cognitive technologies are based on matching transmission parameters to the surrounding radio environment, several practical problems related to weak signal detection must be solved. These include, e.g., uncertainty of the noise variance value, the changes of this value in time and space, limited hardware resources or time of detection. All of these factors can seriously degrade system performance. The search for practically useful solutions of the encountered difficulties is therefore very important for the successful development and implementation of CR technology. This article provides an overview and comparison of chosen blind detection methods proposed for use in CR receivers. The comparison is based on simulation results, and the methods are compared in terms of detection efficiency, time complexity and robustness to changes in transmission parameters. © 2016 IEEE.","cognitive radio; goodness of fit testing; weak signal detection","Cognitive radio; Complex networks; Digital signal processing; Radio systems; Radio transmission; Signal processing; Blind detection method; Detection efficiency; Goodness-of-fit testing; Hardware resources; Practical problems; Radio environment; Transmission parameters; Weak signal detection; Signal detection",,,,,"Mitola, J., Maguire, G., Cognitive radio: Making software radios more personal (1999) Personal Communications, IEEE, 6, pp. 13-18; Bogucka, H., Cognitive radio technologies (2013) PWN; Yucek, T., Arslan, H., A survey of spectrum sensing algorithms for cognitive radio applications (2009) Communications Surveys &Tutorials, IEEE, 11, pp. 116-130; Garello, R., Jia, Y., Comparision of spectrum sensing methods for cognitive radio under low SNR (2011) IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC), pp. 886-889; Pratas, N., Prasad, N.R., Rodrigues, A., Prasad, R., Cooperative spectrum sensing: State of the art review (2011) 2nd International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace &Electronic Systems Technology (Wireless VITAE), pp. 1-6; Mariani, A., Giorgetti, A., Chiani, M., Effects of noise power estimation on energy detection for cognitive radio applications (2011) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 59, pp. 3410-3420; Zhi, T., Tafesse, Y., Sadler, B., Cyclic feature detection with sub-nyquist sampling for wideband spectrum sensing (2012) IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 6, pp. 58-69; Guowei, Z., Xiaodong, W., Ying-Chang, L., Ju, L., Fast and robust spectrum sensing via kolmogorov-smirnov test (2010) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 58, pp. 3410-3416; Anderson, T.W., Darling, D.A., Asymptotic theory of certain Goodness of Fit criteria based on stochastic processes (1952) Ann.

It shows how words and phrases, used by members of the public in Social Media, can be treated as weak signals of OC, enabling information to be classified according to a taxonomy of OC. Formal Concept Analysis is used to group information sources, according to Crime and Location, thus providing a means of corroboration and creating OC Concepts that can be used to alert police analysts to the possible presence of OC. The analyst is able to ‘drill down’ into an OC Concept of interest, discovering additional information that may be pertinent to the crime. The paper describes the implementation of this approach into a fully-functional prototype software system, incorporating a Social Media Scanning System and a map-based user interface. The approach and system are illustrated using the Trafficking of Human Beings as an example. Real data is used to obtain results that show that weak signals of OC have been detected and corroborated, thus alerting to the possible presence of OC. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Crime; Formal concept analysis; Graphic methods; Social networking (online); Software prototyping; User interfaces; Functional Prototypes; Human being; Human trafficking; Information sources; Organised crime; Scanning systems; Social media; Weak signals; Signal detection",,,,,"Andrews, S., In-Close2, a high performance formal concept miner (2011) ICCS-ConceptStruct 2011.

The objective is to incorporate Kalman filter in the tracking channel of a GPS receiver. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The tracking channel keeps synchronizing continuously, the received satellite signal and the locally generated code and carrier frequencies, using tracking loops. The first step is to develop a tracking channel and the next step is to develop a Kalman filter model suitable for the design. The reliable and standard tracking loops for tracking code and carrier are Delay Locked Loop (DLL) and Costas Loop respectively. When these loops lose the lock, i.e., when the signals are weak, the receivers can no longer retrieve the navigation data unless the code and carrier comes in lock again. This causes disturbance in tracking, i.e., the receiver can no longer determine its position until the signal becomes strong. The proposed design can solve this problem by using a Kalman filter in a phase lock loop. Findings: The Kalman filter, with its linear recursive filtering provides greater accuracy in estimating the phase/frequency of the received incoming signal with the initial state of the system, noise statistics of the system and the corresponding measurement errors. The replacement of Low Pass Filter (LPF) with the Kalman filter in the tracking channel provides a better estimation of tracking. The analysis reveals that the Kalman filter is the best replacement tool that can strongly influence the area of navigation in a way that minimizes the error in tracking. Conclusion: Thus the design ensures the continuous tracking of GPS signals by preventing the need for frequent requisition even under weak signal conditions.","GPS receiver; Kalman filter; Tracking channel; Tracking loops; Weak signal",,,,,,"Tsui, J.B., (2000) Fundamentals of Global Positioning System Receivers: A Software Approach, , John Wiley and Sons, INC; Ward, P., Satellite Signal Acquisition and Tracking (2006) In Understanding GPS: Principles and Applications, Mobile Communication Series, 5, pp. 119-208; Bertelsen, N., Borre, K., Rinder, P., The GPS Code Software Receiver at Aalborg University (2004), Technical report, Danish GPS Center, Aalborg University; Misra, P., Enge, P., (2001) Global Positioning System: Signals, Measurements, and Performance, , Ganga-Jamuna Press; Psiaki, M.L., Smoother-Based GPS Signal Tracking in a Software Receiver, , Cornell University; Gardner, F.M., (1979) Phase locks Techniques, , 2nd ed.

First, the strength ratio of the largest peak to the second largest peak was adopted as the decision variable; optimum decision thresholds can be obtained through the simulation probability of false alarm of all kinds of acquisition algorithms. Second, by setting the decision threshold, the probabilities of detection of different Doppler frequency deviation and signal to noise ratio (SNR) were obtained. Finally, acquisition sensitivities of the code acquisition algorithm based on the differential coherent accumulation were compared with those of the code acquisition algorithm based on coherent and noncoherent accumulation and the code acquisition algorithm based on noncoherent accumulation. Simulation results show that acquisition sensitivities of the code acquisition algorithm based on the differential coherent accumulation are improved by about 2.0 dB than those of the other two acquisition algorithms under the same receiving data length condition. ©, 2015, Editorial Board of Journal on Communications.

The nature of GNSS signal propagation in typical signal impeding wireless channels such as indoors and urban environments is studied. The signal power distribution, delay spread, and Doppler spread characteristics of real GNSS signals in such environments are investigated. Based on the observations obtained from this characterization, a closed-loop tracking architecture based on spatial diversity reception is proposed. The proposed algorithm is tested on real data collected using two antennas in indoor static and urban kinematic scenarios. The carrier loop tracking, code loop tracking, and pseudorange errors are compared between single antenna reception and dual antenna spatial diversity reception for different scenarios. Results show that the proposed tracking method improves the Doppler measurement by more than 50% and pseudorange measurements by 2-5 m compared to a single antenna receiver. © 2014 IEEE.","antenna diversity; Doppler spread; fading; GNSS; spatial combining; tracking; urban canyon; weak signal","Antennas; Diversity reception; Location based services; Satellite antennas; Surface discharges; Telecommunication services; Antenna diversity; Doppler spread; fading; GNSS; spatial combining; Urban canyons; Weak signals; Global positioning system",,,,,"Braasch, M.S., (1996) American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1, pp. 547-568; Tepedelenlioglu, A.A., Giannakis, G.B., Kaveh, M., Estimation of doppler spread and signal strength in mobile communications with application to handoff and adaptive transmission (2001) Communication and Mobile Computing, 1, pp. 221-230; Blaunstein, N., Andersen, J.B., (2002) Multipath Phenomena in Cellular Networks, , Artech House, Inc., USA; Sokhandan, N., Broumandan, A., Lachapelle, G., High resolution (2012) Proc.

Here we show a new type of atomic-scale spectroscopy, heterodyne scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (HSTS), which is based on the innovative application of the nonlinear heterodyne-mixing detection at the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) heterojunction of STM tip-vacuum-sample. The principle of HSTS is identical to that of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) space telescope in terms of using heterojunction for detecting extremely weak signals by converting from terahertz region to lower frequency regions. The MIM detector of ALMA, which is composed of niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN) tip-insulator-NbTiN, is very similar in shape and size to that of HSTS. We successfully detect a heterodyne beat signal f3 (=|f2 - f1|) and intermodulation distortion via tunnelling current by superimposing two different AC signals, f1 and f2, onto the DC tunnelling current at a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface. We then obtain spectra of the localized electronic states of HOPG by using f3. HSTS can be performed with a high resolution and over a wide energy range, including the terahertz range.",,,,,,,"Zhang, R., Chemical mapping of a single molecule by plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering (2013) Nature, 498, pp. 82-86; Guo, D., Observation of Landau levels in potassium-intercalated graphite under a zero magnetic field (2012) Nat Commun., 3, p. 1068; Loth, S., Controlling the state of quantum spins with electric currents (2010) Nat Phys., 6, pp. 340-344; Heinrich, A.J., Gupta, J.A., Lutz, C.P., Eigler, D.M., Single-atom spin-flip spectroscopy (2004) Science, 306, pp. 466-469; Stipe, B.C., Rezaei, M.A., Ho, W., Single-molecule vibrational spectroscopy and microscopy (1998) Science, 280, pp. 1732-1735; Balatsky, A.V., Fransson, J., Mozyrsky, D., Manassen, Y., STMNMRand nuclear spin noise (2006) Phys.

These instruments include the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), terrestrial sensor networks, and NASA satellites participating in 'decadal survey"" missions. Their unprecedented coverage and sensitivity will likely reveal wholly new categories of unexpected and transient events. Commensal methods passively analyze these data streams, recognizing anomalous events of scientific interest and reacting in real time. Here, the authors report on a case example: Very Long Baseline Array Fast Transients Experiment (V-FASTR), an ongoing commensal experiment at the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) that uses online adaptive pattern recognition to search for anomalous fast radio transients. V-FASTR triages a millisecond-resolution stream of data and promotes candidate anomalies for further offline analysis. It tunes detection parameters in real time, injecting synthetic events to continually retrain itself for optimum performance. This self-tuning approach retains sensitivity to weak signals while adapting to changing instrument configurations and noise conditions. The system has operated since July 2011, making it the longest-running real-time commensal radio transient experiment to date. © 2014 IEEE.","fast radio transients; intelligent systems; pattern recognition; radio astronomy; real-time machine learning; time series analysis","Data communication systems; Experiments; Instruments; Intelligent systems; NASA; Pattern recognition; Sensor networks; Surveys; Time series analysis; Transients; Adaptive pattern recognition; Astronomical data; Large synoptic survey telescopes; Long baseline array; Off-line analysis; Optimum performance; Square kilometer arrays; Transient experiments; Radio astronomy",,,,,"Dewdney, P., (2009) Proc.

The signal intensity is assumed to be inversely proportional to a power of the distance from the object.

With information processing by biological organisms, stochastic resonance (SR) can enhance sensitivity by superimposing proper noise upon undetectable weak signals to detect the target signal. To investigate the SR of human tactile sensation and elucidate the mechanism of tactile SR for the development of a new tactile sensor, we performed a series of psychophysical experiments using tangential vibration with 2.5-mm and 8-mm-sized stimulus points. We examined the difference threshold (difference limen; DL) variation obtained from these experiments to clarify which conditions of vibration direction and stimulus size cause the strongest SR. The experimental results show that neither normal nor tangential DL is significantly affected by stimulus point size. Moreover, tactile sensing precision is enhanced by appropriate noise. The characteristics of SR, with normal vibration obtained from our prior study is quite different from that with tangential vibration. © 2013 Beceren et al.; licensee InTech.","Psychophysical experiment; Sensor; Stochastic resonance; Tactile sensing; Tangential vibration","Biological organisms; Difference threshold; Normal vibrations; Psychophysical experiments; Stochastic resonances; Tactile sensation; Tactile sensing; Tangential vibration; Circuit resonance; Color photography; Data processing; Sensors; Magnetic resonance",,,,,"Gammaitoni, L., Hanggi, P., Jung, P., Marchesoni, F., Stochastic resonance (1998) Reviews of Modern Physics, 70 (1), pp. 223-287; Moss, F., Ward, L.M., Sannita, W.G., Stochastic resonance and sensory information processing: A tutorial and review of application (2004) Clinical Neurophysiology, 115 (2), pp. 267-281. , DOI 10.1016/j.clinph.2003.09.014; Verrillo, R.T., Effect of spatial parameters on the vibrotactile threshold (1963) Journal of Experimental Psychology, 71, pp. 570-575; Verrillo, R.T., A duplex mechanism of mechanoreception (1968) The Skin Senses, pp. 139-159. , DR Kenshalo (Ed.)

This brings new challenges to the security management of network boundary. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to detect the pseudo Web behavior which abuses the general HTTP protocol to pass through the network boundary. A new parameter is defined to extract the features of Web-session based on the inter-arrival time of HTTP requests. A nonlinear mapping function is introduced to protect the weak signals from the interference of the infrequent large values. An hidden Markov model with state duration is applied to describe the normal access behavior of Web sessions. The proposed model is dynamic, and does not rely on presupposed threshold and client-or server-side data which are widely used in traditional session detection approaches. An objective function is derived for predicting the near future behavior of a user's Web-session. The deviation between the prediction result and the real observation is used for detecting the pseudo Web behavior. Experiments based on real HTTP traces from large-scale Web proxies are implemented to valid the proposal. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Detection; Modeling; Web session","Detection approach; HTTP protocols; HTTP traffic; Inter-arrival time; Internet services; Network boundaries; New parameters; Nonlinear mapping functions; Objective functions; Security management; Weak signals; Web proxy; Web sessions; Behavioral research; Error detection; Hidden Markov models; Hypertext systems; Internet protocols; Models; HTTP",,,,,"Jackson, T., Anomaly-based HTTP covert tunnel detection using hidden Markov models (2007) Masters Abstracts International, 46 (4); Dusi, M., Crotti, M., Gringoli, F., Salgarelli, L., Tunnel hunter: Detecting application-layer tunnels with statistical fingerprinting (2009) Computer Networks, 53 (1), pp. 81-97; Lee, J., Jeong, H., Park, J., Kim, M., Noh, B., The activity analysis of malicious http-based botnets using degree of periodic repeatability (2008) Security Technology, 2008.

It utilizes wireless network as a terrestrial network channel to deliver orbital parameters, coarse time, and location references known as assistance data. As the network channel is a main factor of A-GPS support, statistic models of delays occurring in assistance data delivery process should be properly studied to support sufficient scenarios. This paper presents a methodology of assistance delay estimation and modeling for A-GPS mobile devices that is applicable to various simulation environments. It demonstrates a Mobile Station (MS) based testbed that exploits the standardized communication architecture as a data channel, Secure User Plane Location (SUPL), to deliver A-GPS assistance data. Measurement campaigns are conducted and network delay models are derived for various representative distances based on various mobile networks, such as third-generation mobile telecommunication (3G), high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), and fourth-generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE), via the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connection between an A-GPS server and a receiver.",,"Internet protocols;

In the search for signals, a coarse search grid in either code or frequency dimension may lead to missing some weak signals, but it may allow the application of computationally attractive acquisition methods. The recurrent tool for accelerated acquisition in GNSS software receivers is Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which allows search parallelization in either dimension. While its application in the code delay search does not generally affect the acquisition detection performance, the same is not necessarily true in the frequency domain, due to the impossibility to freely adjust the FFT frequency resolution. In this paper, a new method for GNSS signal acquisition is introduced, employing a low-complexity approach adopted from signal processing literature which allows improving the accuracy of the frequency estimation through FFT. This is achieved by calculating an offset (delta) based on the magnitude of the FFT bins obtained in the spectral analysis of the signal. The delta value represents an estimate of the difference between the true signal frequency and the closest FFT frequency bin, therefore improving the FFT-only estimation accuracy, without the need for heavy computations. The methodology to apply the SPL delta-correction technique in the acquisition of GNSS signals is developed and detailed, and results from both simulation and real data collections are used to illustrate the capacities of the newly developed method. The analysis presented show that the new method is capable of keeping the desired low complexity while being robust to a wide range of Doppler shifts within the FFT bin, contrarily to the standard approach.",,"Bins; Fast Fourier transforms; Frequency estimation; Global positioning system; Mergers and acquisitions; Spectrum analysis; Detection performance; Frequency dimensions; Frequency domains; Frequency resolutions; GNSS software receiver; ITS applications; Parallelizations; Signal frequencies; Signal processing",,,,,"Kaplan, E., (2006) Understanding GPS: Principles and Application, pp. 219-231. , 2nd Edition, Artech House Norwood, MA; Van Graas, F., Soloviev, A., Closed-loop sequential signal processing and open-loop batch processing approaches for GNSS receiver design (2009) IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 3 (4), pp. 571-586; Akopian, D., Fast FFT based GPS satellite acquisition methods (2005) IEE Proceeding Radar, Sonar, and Navigation, 152 (4), pp. 277-286; O'Driscoll, C., (2007) Performance Analysis of the Parallel Acquisition of Weak GPS Signals, , PhD Dissertation, National University of Ireland, Cork, Ireland; DeSalas, J., Van Diggelen, F., Single-shot position: Cell-phone location without ephemeris (2011) GPS World; Jiménez-Banos, D., Blanco-Delgado, N., Innovative techniques for GPS indoor positioning using a snapshot receiver (2006) ION GNSS 2006, , Fort Worth, TX; Sagiraju, P., Akopian, D., Fine frequency estimation in weak signals for GPS receivers (2006) ION NTM 2006, , Monterey, CA; Tsui, J., (2005) Fundamentals of Global Positioning System Receivers: A Software Approach, , 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; Pany, T., Göhler, E., On the state-of-the-art of real-time GNSS signal acquisition - A comparison of time and frequency domain methods (2010) 2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), , Zürich, Switzerland; Psiaki, M., Block acquisition of weak GPS signals in a software receiver (2001) Proceedings of ION GPS 2001, , Salt Lake City, UT; Borre, K., Akos, D., (2007) A Software-Defined GPS and Galileo Receiver - A Single-Frequency Approach, , Birkhäuser, Boston, MA; Lin, D., Tsui, J., Acquisition schemes for software GPS receiver (1998) Proceedings of ION GPS 1998, , Nashville, TN; Pany, T., (2010) Navigation Signal Processing for GNSS Software Receivers, , Artech House, Norwood, MA; Harris, F., On the use of windows for harmonic analysis with the discrete fourier transform (1978) Proceedings of the IEEE, 66, pp. 51-83; Kay, S., A fast and accurate single frequency estimator (1989) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 37, pp. 1987-1990; Tahir, M., Fantino, M., Lo Presti, L., Characterizing different open loop fine frequency estimation methods for GNSS receivers (2012) Proceedings of ION ITM 2012, , Newport Beach, CA; Schmid, A., Advanced galileo and GPS receiver techniques: Enhanced sensitivity and improved accuracy (2009) Nova Science, , Hauppage, NY; Sahmoudi, M., Esteves, P., A new frequency offset correction approach for enhancing sensitivity of GNSS receivers (2011) Proceedings of ION GNSS 2011, , Portland, OR; Spangenberg, S., Scott, I., An FFT-based approach for fast acquisition in spread spectrum communication systems (2000) Wireless Personal Communications Journal, 13, pp. 27-56; Jacobsen, E., Kootsookos, P., Fast, accurate frequency estimators (2007) Streamlining Digital Signal Processing: A Tricks of the Trade Guidebook, pp. 107-114. , Chapter 10; Candan, C., A method for fine resolution frequency estimation from three DFT samples (2011) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 18 (6); Tang, X., Falletti, E., Lo Presti, L., Fast nearly ML estimation of doppler frequency in GNSS signal acquisition process (2013) Sensors, 13, pp. 5649-5670","Esteves, P.; Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace (ISAE/SUPAERO), TéSA, University of ToulouseFrance",,"","Institute of Navigation","26th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS 2013","16 September 2013 through 20 September 2013","Nashville, TN",104477,,,,,"English","Int.

With WiFi becoming more and more ubiquitous, there are many WiFi-enabled devices, which have access to GPS but are not necessarily enabled for GSM/CDMA2000/WiMAX services. In this paper, the concept of WiFi-based A-GPS as a promising approach for receiver-level integration of WiFi and GPS is presented. Although research has been dedicated to accomplish A-GPS systems using assistance information from wireless networks (such as cellular networks), no scheme has yet been published to use 802.11 WLAN signals to provide complete assistance information including frequency, approximate user position and fine time assistance. This paper presents a method of relative time estimation sufficient to enable an effective and complete WiFi-based A-GPS. The proposed system can be deployed in places where WiFi coverage is available and where there is no or limited access to other synchronized systems based on the existing infrastructure. Examples include WiFi enabled mobile devices deployed on university campuses, hospitals and shopping malls, where there may be a need for providing A-GPS services to WiFi users that cannot access other networks.",,"802.11 networks; Cellular network; Integrated frameworks; Positioning technologies; Robust Positioning; Synchronized systems; University campus; WiFi-enabled mobile devices; Mobile devices; Navigation; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Wi-Fi; Global positioning system",,,,,"Amidi, S., Method and Apparatus for Location Detection Using GPS and WiFiAVIMAX (2010), US Patent 2010/0026569; Bhattacharya, T., Estimating the Location of a Wireless Terminal Based on Assisted-GPS and Pattern Matching (2006), US Patent 2006/0240841; Carlson, H., Koorapaty, H., Systems and Methods for Providing GPS Time and Assistance in a Communication Network (2006), US Patent 7009948 B1; Cho, Y., Kim, J., Yang, W., Kang, C.G., (2010) MIMO-OFDM Wireless Communications, , Wiley-IEEE Press; Deric, W., Xhafa, A.E., Vedantham, R., Ramasubramanian, K., Fine-Time Assistance for GNSS using WiFi (2011) International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), 21-23 September, Guimarães, Portugal; Dick, C., Harris, F., FPGA Implementation of an OFDM PHY (2003) 37th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, 1, pp. 905-909; Duffett-Smith, P.J., Hansen, P., Precise time transfer in a mobile radio terminal (2005) Proceedings of ION NTM 2005, Jan 24-26, San Diego, California, pp. 1101-1106; Goran, M., Richton, R.E., Geolocation and Assisted GPS (2001) IEEE Computer Society Press, 34 (2), pp. 123-125; Guffey, J., Wyglinski, A.M., Minden, G.J., Agile RadioImplementation of OFDM Physical Layer for Dynamic Spectrum Access Research (2007) GLOBECOM, pp. 4051-4055; (2003) 802.11g, Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications Amendment 4: Further Higher Data Rate Extension in the 2.4 GHz Band, , Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); Martin, R.K., Yan, C., Fan, H., Rondeau, C., Algorithms and bounds for distributed TDOA-based positioning using OFDM signals (2011) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 59 (3), pp. 1255-1268; Monnerat, M., Method for the Accelerated Acquisition of Satellite Signals (2007), US Patent 20070194985A1; Nicoletti, P., (2005) IEEE 802.11 Frame Format, , www.studioreti.it; Proakis, J.G., (2001) Digital Communications, , 4th ed., McGraw-Hill; Progri, F., Wireless-enabled GPS indoor geolocation system (2010) Proc.

The digital watermarking can be viewed as a process that embedding a weak signal (watermark) to a strong signal (original image), so the process of watermarking can be viewed as a process of image fusion. In the proposed watermarking algorithm, the watermark embedding and extraction process are expressed as the state estimate process, and Kalman filter is used as an optimal estimation algorithm in the process of image fusion. An optimal estimation model is built according to the watermark image and the original image, and then the state equation and the corresponding measurement equation are built. The optimal estimation is archived in case of the minimum estimation error variance. Crossentropy and mutual information are used to evaluate the performance of image fusion. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a good performance in both robustness and invisibility. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Image fusion; Kalman filtering; Mutual information;

A method is proposed in this paper to suppress the sidelobes of matched filter output. The basic idea is to design an FIR filter at the output of matched filter, so that to minimize the ISL (Integrated Sidelobe Level), while keeping the mainlobe unchanged. The optimal solution is achieved utilizing the convex optimization method. In numerical simulation, the performance of the method is compared with conventional matched filter plus Hamming window methods. The performance is improved 30dB with output gain unchanged simultaneously. The method is also used to design a close-in sidelobe-free filter. The close-in sidelobe level could achieve-80dB in the simulation. © 2012 IEEE.","Convex optimization; Matched filter; Peak sidelobe level; Sidelobe reduction","Bistatic; Conventional matched filter; Hamming window; Optimal solutions; Peak sidelobe level; Side lobes; Side-lobe reduction; Sidelobe levels; Weak signals; Convex optimization; Directional patterns (antenna); Environmental engineering; FIR filters; Matched filters; Sonar; Underwater acoustics; Pattern matching",,,,,"Cox, H., (1989) Fundamentals of Bistatic Active Sonar.

The projects resulted in the evaluation of current methods for obtaining and processing scanning data and new conceptual thinking that may bridge the gap between scanning activities and policy-making. This paper provides an overview of conceptual thinking in two projects, SESTI and FAR Horizon. The key thinking is about emerging issues and aboutimaginative or potential wild cards, both considered to be potential storylines for future development or events that require policy action. Storylines come close to the concept of future narratives, as used in the policy discourse regarding aging in the Netherl and s. The shows that narratives are used by policymakers when they fit a particular strategy, but that the narratives must compete with both present-day (experienced ""past reality"") and future stories in policy discourse. The author describes strong ""future"" narratives and gives special attention those that include imaginative wild cards. The communicative strength of a future narrative (and the included issue) is decisive for its uptake in the discourse (in policy and business communities). However, this strength is only partly connected to its scientific or factual evidence base, since it may contain many elements that are not rational to make it strong. The paper is concerned with what makes a ""strong"" narrative. Next to the authority of the messenger and the interests of the receiver, its psychological and emotional appeal to the audience and its historical context make it persuasive. Examplesare given to show that future narratives are used to influence policy debates and decision making. Some have even succeeded in shaping the future to the interest of the author or for the benefit of society. The argument is that strong imaginative wild cards under the right conditions can have a powerful shaping effect, sometimes as shaping as that of real wild cards on the future.","Early warning; Emerging issues; Horizon scanning; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Chilton, P.A., (2004) Analyzing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice, , London: Routledge; Friedemann, F., Pre-earthquake signals: Underlying physical processes (2011) Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, , (in print); Georghiou, L., Cassingena Harper, J., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Hiltunen, E., Good sources of weak signals: Global study of where futurists look for weak signals (2008) Journal of Futures Studies, 12 (4), pp. 21-42; Loveridge, D., (2009) Foresight: The Art and Science of Anticipating the Future, , New York: Routledge; Markley, O., Staying resilient in a wild-card world (2011) Journal of the Institute of Noetic Science, (6); Morrison, J.L., Environmental scanning (1992) A Primer for New Institutional Researchers, pp. 86-99. , (eds.

At last, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by a simulation example. © 2011 IEEE.","Chaos; Coupling synchronization; Duffing oscillator; The weak signal detection","Chaotic model; Coupled duffing oscillators; Duffing oscillator; Low SNR; Simulation example; SNR threshold; Synchronization method; Testing method; Weak signal detection; Weak signals; Chaos theory; Fault detection; Fractals; Oscillators (mechanical); Synchronization; Signal detection",,,,,"Ning, A.P., (2006) The Research of Weak Signal Detection at Chaotic Background, , Shanxi: Taiyuan University of Technology; Yu, H.J., Han, Q.D., Li, S., (2001) Fault Diagnosis Engineering of Equipments, , Beijing: Metallurgical Industry Press; Wang, G.Y., He, S.L., A quantitative study on detection and estimation of weak signals by using chaotic duffing oscillators (2003) IEEE Transaction on Fundamental Theory and Applications, pp. 945-953; Gao, J.Z., (2004) Weak Signal Detection, , Bejing: Tsinghua University Press; Bian, Z.G., The present situation and sevelopment trends of sensor and detecting Instrument (2007) Automation Panorama, pp. 14-15; Letellier, C., Aziz-Alaoui, M.A., Analysis of the dynamics of a realistic ecological model (2002) Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, pp. 95+107; He, Z.Y., (2002) Adaptive Signal, , Bejing: Bejing Science Press; Zhao, Y., Zhang, S., Generalized dimension-reduction framework for recent-biased time series analysis (2006) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, pp. 231-244; Vanassche, P., Gielen, G., Sansen, W., On the difference between two widely publicized methods for analyzing oscillator phase behavior ICCAD, 2002; Jiang, P., Jia, M.P., Xu, F.Y., Hu, J.Z., Feature extraction of weak signal in machine fault diagnosis (2005) Journal of Vibration,Measurement & Diagnosis, pp. 48-50; Bao, G., Han, Y.C., Dynamic behavior of phase synchronization of coupled chaotic oscillators (2005) Journal of Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities (Natural Sciences,Quarterly), pp. 22-24; Li, Y., Xu, K., Yang, B.J., Analysis of the geometric characteristic quantity of the periodic solutions of the chaotic oscillator system and the quantitative detection of weak periodic signal (2008) Acta Physica Sinica, pp. 3353-3358","Li, N.; School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China; email: lining20062318@yahoo.cn",,"Northeastern University;Hangzhou Dianzi University;City University of Hong Kong;IEEE Circuits and Systems Society;National Science Foundation of China",,"4th International Workshop on Chaos-Fractals Theories and Applications, IWCFTA 2011","19 October 2011 through 21 October 2011","Hangzhou, Zhejiang",87807,,9780769545608,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

However, for indoor and dense urban environments, the accuracy deteriorates significantly due to weak signals and dense multipath. The situation becomes worse in indoor environments where the GPS signals are unreliable or totally blocked. On the other side, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are self-contained systems that can be used indoor/outdoor evenly. However, INS provides only good short-term accuracy. The mathematical integration causes even small sensor errors to accumulate resulting in large position drifts that grow over time. In addition, if low cost MEMS-based inertial sensors are to be used, then sensors random errors are hard to model because of the high non-linearity in its behavior. Thus, an accurate and reliable indoor positioning is still one of the greatest challenges in the field of navigation. Therefore, in this research we propose an alternative indoor 3D integrated navigation system for wheeled vehicles using the existing IEEE 802.11 WLAN (WiFi) which is widely available in indoor environments, and Low Cost MEMS-based reduced inertial sensors system (RISS). The system development and integration is based on Bayesian Inference techniques; Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for wireless propagation modeling and optimized adaptive version of Mixture Particle Filter (PF) algorithm for state estimation. Real experiments on a mobile robot showed that the integration between WiFi and RISS improved the overall accuracy of the system providing sub-meter accuracy for 50% of the time, 2.5 meters accuracy for 65% of time and maximum position error of 5.8 meters.",,"Adaptive versions; Bayesian inference; Dense multipath; Dense urban environments; Gaussian process regression; GPS signals; IEEE802.11 WLAN; Indoor environment; Indoor/outdoor; Inertial sensor; Integrated navigation systems; Low costs; Non-Linearity; Particle filter; Position errors; Reliable indoor positioning; Sensor errors; Sub meter; System development; Weak signals; Wheeled vehicles; Wireless propagation modeling; Bayesian networks; Inertial navigation systems; Inference engines; Microelectromechanical devices; Satellites; Sensors; Signal receivers; Standards; Wi-Fi; Global positioning system",,,,,"Grewal, M., Weill, S.L.R., Andrews, A.P., (2007) Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration, , Wiley & Sons Inc; Titterton, D.H., Weston, J.L., (2004) Strapdown Inertial Navigation Technology. - 2nd Edition, , The Institution of Electrical Engineers; Priyanka, A., Zainab, Syed., Naser, E., (2010) MEMS-Based Integrated Navigation, , Artech House; Iqbal, U., Okou, A.F., Noureldin, A., An integrated reduced inertial sensor system RISS / GPS for land vehicle Position, Location and Navigation Symposium, 2008 IEEE/ION, pp. 1014-1021; Farrell, J.A., (2008) Aided Navigation, GPS with High Rate Sensors, , McGraw Hill; Smith, C., Meyer, J., (2005) 3G Wireless with WiMAX and WiFi, , McGraw-Hill; WiFi Alliance Web-report, , http://www.wifi.org/news_articles.php?f=media_news&news_id=643, Accessed on 20th August 2011; Herńandez, N., Herranz, F., Ocãna, M., Bergasa, L.M., WiFi Localization System based on Fuzzy Logic to deal with Signal Variations (2009) Proceedings of the 14th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation, , September; Ciurana, M., Barcelo-Arroyo, F., Izquierdo, F., A ranging system with IEEE 802.11 data frames (2007) IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium; Roxin, A., Gaber, J., Wack, M., Nait-Sidi-Moh, A., Survey of Wireless Geolocation Techniques (2007) Globecom Workshops, pp. 1-9. , Washington, DC; Liu, H., Darabi, H., Banerjee, P., Jing, L., Survey of Wireless Indoor Positioning Techniques and Systems (2007) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C, Applications and Reviews, pp. 1067-1080; Zhao, X., Goodall, C., Syed, Z., Wright, B., El-Sheimy, N., Wi-Fi Assisted Multi-sensor Personal Navigation System for Indoor Environments ION 2010 International Technical Meeting, January 25-27, 2010, San Diego, CA; Jingbin, L., Ruizhi, C., Ling, P., Wei, C., Tomi, T., Heidi, K., Tuomo, K., Yuwei, C., Accelerometer Assisted Robust Wireless Signal Positioning Based on a Hidden Markov Model (2010) IEEE/ION, Position Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS), , March; Atia, M.M., Noureldin, A., Georgy, J., Korenberg, M., Bayesian Filtering Based WiFi/INS Integrated Navigation Solution for GPS-denied Environments (2011) Navigation, 58 (2), pp. 111-125. , Summer; Rasmussen, C.E., Williams, C., (2006) Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning, , MIT Press; Georgy, J., Noureldin, A., Korenberg, M., Bayoumi, M., Low Cost 3D Navigation Solution for RISS/GPS Integration Using Mixture Particle Filter (2010) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 59 (2), pp. 599-615. , Feb; Arulampalam, M.S., Maskell, S., Gordon, N., Clapp, T., A Tutorial on Particle Filters for Online Nonlinear/Non-Gaussian Bayesian Tracking (2002) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 50 (2). , February; Thrun, S., Fox, D., Burgard, W., Dellaert, F., Robust Monte Carlo Localization for Mobile Robots (2001) Artificial Intelligence, 128, pp. 99-141; Atia, M.M., Georgy, J., Korenberg, M.J., Noureldin, A., Real-time implementation of mixture particle filter for 3D RISS/GPS integrated navigation solution (2010) Electron.

The goal is the acquisition of soft-skills (e.g. negotiation, leadership, and identification of weak signals) and complex competences which are needed in emerging fields such as Sustainable Global Manufacturing. Sustainability combines environmental, economic, and social dimensions and is considered to be a complex and hard to learn subject needing a lot of experience to create competence. Therefore, the construction of a serious game to support the generation of such competences is not trivial and must be founded on a sound requirements analysis. The aim of this paper is to present relevant findings from the requirements analysis phase for developing a serious game scenario for a technology-enhanced learning platform called TARGET.

This has motivated in recent years an increasing research activity on signal processing techniques for GNSS receivers. However, one main limitation faced by these GNSS receivers is the propagation of GNSS signals in complex scenarios such as urban canyons and indoor, where signals suffer from high attenuation, severe multipath, near-far problem and non-Line Of Sight (LOS) propagation. These limitations have given rise to highly specialized GNSS receiver architectures, such as snapshot or one shot, overcoming the computational cost of the required processing algorithms and allowing manufacturers the integration of GNSS receivers in mobile platforms. They are commonly known as High Sensitivity GNSS (HS-GNSS) receivers [8]. The European Galileo system will provide additional signals for usage and will most likely improve overall GNSS-based positioning, as well as the role of GNSS technology as an LBS enabler. Research on high-sensitivity Galileo receivers has been quite limited so far; therefore an extensive research activity is necessary. Some effort on Elbc signals has been done, but E5 has not been sufficiently explored [1]. A higher bandwidth and the possibility of using two signals are an advantage in terms of performance in urban canyons or indoor. Nevertheless, a higher bandwidth translates in a higher sampling rate and computational load. The objective of this work focuses on the design, implementation and performance evaluation of a snapshot software receiver system that exploits the properties of Galileo E5 pilot signals to detect very weak signals, offering a simple yet efficient acquisition-based receiver. The design is based on an acquisition stage that uses efficient signal processing techniques to deliver delay-Doppler estimates and can lead to a position fix without requiring a tracking stage.",,"Computational costs; Computational loads; GALILEO; Galileo receivers; GALILEO system; Global navigation satellite systems; GNSS receivers; GNSS signals; High-sensitivity; Innovative approaches; Location-Based Services; Mobile platform; Multi-path; Near-far problem; Nonline of sight; Performance evaluation; Pilot signals; Processing algorithms; Research activities; Sampling rates; Signal processing technique; Software receivers; Urban canyons; Weak signals; Work Focus; Bandwidth; Global positioning system; Navigation; Research; Satellites; Signal processing; Signal receivers",,,,,"Blanco-Delgado, N., Jimenez-Baños, D., Lopez-Risueno, G., Seco-Granados, G., Acquisition of Galileo LlC in Weak Signal Environment with Secondary Code Synchronization 1st CNES Workshop on Galileo Signals and Signal Processing, 2006; Bryant, R., Assisted GPS.

A major application area is provision of accurate time for fixed Femtocell and Picocell base stations which are located indoors and typically have very weak GPS signal reception. In these applications the base station is at a fixed location and the receiver undergoes no dynamics. The receiver is designed to provide excellent weak-signal reception at low cost and to be adaptable to many platforms. Since all signal processing is executed in software, all that is needed for full operation is an antenna, conventional RF module with a TCXO, and a host microprocessor in which the software is embedded. Extensive testing of this system with both GPS signal simulators and off-the-air signals has shown that acquisition of-163 dBm signals (C/N0 = 11 dB-Hz) can occur when assisting with the small time and/or frequency uncertainty characteristic of typical CDMA AGPS systems. On the other hand, reliable acquisition of -160 dBm signals has been demonstrated with assisting information coming only from the internet and having much larger uncertainties. In both cases signals at -163 dBm can be tracked. Unlike many high-sensitivity receiver designs, there is no reliance on at least one relatively strong signal to enable acquisition. However, if any strong signals are found, the acquisition search strategy subsequently takes advantage of them to reduce the time to first fix (TTFF). For high acquisition sensitivity, the receiver uses both longterm coherent processing and a final stage of non-coherent processing. The design has features which greatly reduce two well-known difficulties inherent in long-term coherent processing, which are signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss due to TCXO phase instability and increased false alarm probability due to a large number of frequency search cells. Additionally, the extreme sensitivity of the system has been enabled by an innovative combination of pseudorange quality algorithms. Sufficient time transfer accuracy for Femtocell and Picocell applications (at the microsecond level) is also achieved. The software is highly optimized to reduce computational demands imposed by the large amount of throughput required for acquisition in applications with larger time and frequency uncertainties in the assisting data.",,"Application area; Assisted GPS; Coherent processing; Computational demands; Extensive testing; False alarm probability; Femtocell; GPS signal simulators; GPS signals; GPS technologies; High-sensitivity; High-sensitivity receivers; Low costs; Magellan; Non-coherent; Phase instability; Pico-cell; Pseudorange; RF module; Search strategies; Signal to noise; Software GPS receiver; Strong signal; Time to first fixes; Time transfer; Ultrasensitive; Base stations; Crystal oscillators; Embedded software; Navigation; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Signal to noise ratio; Global positioning system",,,,,"Weill, L.R., Kishimoto, N., Hirata, S., Chin, K.X., The Next Generation of a Super Sensitive GPS System Proceedings of ION GNSS-2004, Long Beach, CA, September 2004, pp. 1924-1935; Hirata, S., Lyusin, S., (2001) GPS Position Measuring System and GPS Position Measuring Apparatus, , U.S Patent No. 6,329,946.

The problem with conventional cyclostationarity-based feature detection is that the detection probability of weak signals degrades if multiple signals with different received-power levels are captured simultaneously. Multiple signal identification has been studied in order to solve such a problem. The iterative detection method suppresses the effects of previously-detected signals in the cyclic auto-correlation domain, and so improves the detection probability of weak signals. In this paper, the multiple signal identification method is evaluated based on testbed experiments. In addition, the modification of the multiple signal identification method in which the effects of other signals are previously-relieved is proposed and applied to the testbed instead of the iterative detection method. The detection performance levels of the conventional and proposed detection methods are evaluated and compared to the results of computer simulations. The results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed detection method in spectrum sharing scenarios. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Cyclostationarity; Detection methods; Detection performance; Detection probabilities; Detection technique; Experimental evaluation; Feature detection; Frame format; Frequency synchronization; Iterative detection; Power levels; Prior information; Signal bandwidth; Signal identification; Spectrum sharing; Weak signals; Computer simulation; Iterative methods; Test facilities; Testbeds; Signal detection",,,,,"Mitola III, J., Maguire Jr., G.Q., Cognitive radio: Making software radios more personal (1999) IEEE Personal Commun., 6 (4), pp. 13-18. , Aug; Haykin, S., Cognitive radio: Brain-empowered wireless communications (2005) IEEE JSAC, 23 (2), pp. 201-220. , Feb; Gardner, W.A., (1993) Cyclostationarity in Communications and Signal Processing, , IEEE Press, New York; Gardner, W.A., Measurement of spectral correlation (1986) IEEE Trans.

The high-frequency weak signal mixed with noise is scaled to a low frequency signal. The signal conforms to the adiabatic elimination theory. So when it acts on stochastic resonance systems, the stochastic resonance can arise. The original high frequency weak signal mixed with noise can be retrieved by scaled up by the same ratio. To deal with the unknown frequency mixed with noise, the high frequency mixed signal is scaled down continuously to achieve a suitable matching parameters for the stochastic system. According to the change of resonance spectral peak value, the unknown frequency can be found from the mixed signal. This method is effective for future application. © 2010 IEEE.","High frequency; Scale transformation; Stochastic resonance; Weak signal","Adiabatic elimination; Future applications; High frequency; High frequency HF; Low-frequency signals; Matching parameters; Mixed signal; Periodic signal; Scale transformation; Spectral peak; Stochastic resonances; Weak signal detection; Weak signals; Circuit resonance; Integrated control; Intelligent computing; Magnetic resonance; Stochastic systems; Signal detection",,,,,"Benzi, R., Sutera, A., Vulpiani, A., The mechanism of stochastic resonance (1981) J.Phys.A, 14, pp. 453-457; Benzi, R., Parisi, G., Sutera, A., Vulpiani, A., (1982) Stochastic Resonance in Climatic Change, 34, pp. 10-16; Dykman, M.I., McClintock, P.Y.E., What can stochastic resonance do?

This paper introduces a new spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio systems based on cyclic autocorrelation. This method takes advantage of the amplitude of the cyclic autocorrelation to differentiate the noise from the primary users and detect the presence of the primary users. The method realizes the weak-signal detection in the given spectrum. Comparing with spectrum correlation method, this method has more bigger amplitude. Theoretical analysis for the algorithms is discussed. Computer simulation results are presented to verify the method. © 2010 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; Cyclic autocorrelation; Cyclostationary detection; Spectrum sensing","Cognitive radio; Cyclic autocorrelation; Cyclostationary; Spectrum correlations; Spectrum sensing; Weak signal detection; Autocorrelation; Cognitive systems; Computer simulation; Correlation detectors; Mobile computing; Radio systems; Timing jitter; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Radio",,,,,"Noble, B., Sneddon, I.N., (2005) Facilitating Opportunities for Flexible, Efficient, and Reliable Spectrum use Employing Cognitive Radio Technologies, , Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ET Docket No. 03-108, March; Haykin, S., Cognitive radio: Brain-empowered wireless communications (2005) IEEE Journal on Selected Area in Communications, 23 (5), pp. 201-220. , February; Van Trees, H.L., (1967) Detection, Estimation, and Modulation Theory, , Part I, Wiley, New York; Gardner, W.A., (1988) Statistical Spectral Analysis: A Nonprobabilistic Theory, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Gardner, W.A., Exploitation of spectral redundancy in cyclostationary signals (1991) IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 8 (2), pp. 14-36. , April; Hurd, H.L., Gerr, N.L., Graphical methods for determining the presence of periodic correlation (1991) Journal of Time Series Analysis, 12 (4), pp. 337-350; Wang, J., Chen, T., Huang, B., Cyclo-period estimation for discrete-time cyclo-stationary signals (2006) IEEE Transaction on Signal Processing, 54 (1), pp. 83-94. , January; Chen, H.-S., Gao, W., Daut, D.G., Spectrum sensing using cyclostationary properties and application to IEEE 802.22 WRAN IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 Proceedings, , Statistical; Dandawate, A., Giaanakis, G., Tatistical tests for presence of cyclostationarity (1994) Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 42 (9), pp. 2355-2369","Ou, Y.; Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; email: qq00993@126.com",,"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society;IEEE Communications Society;Southwest Jiaotong University;University of Electronic Science and Technology of China;Wuhan University",,"2010 6th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, WiCOM 2010","23 September 2010 through 25 September 2010","Chengdu",82436,,9781424437092,,,"English","Int.

However, the received acoustic signals are weak ones submerged in strong noise; for the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio or in the background of strong noise, frequency of the signals can not be precisely measured, or even the signal can not be detected at all with the traditional method of frequency measurement dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio. It is the main trend of development of chaos theory at the present stage that it is applied in information processing; the above deficiencies can be overcome by the chaotic oscillator with sensitivity to weak signals and immunity to the noise, which can detect useful signal in the strong noise, and precisely determine its frequency. In this paper, sensitivity of chaotic oscillator to weak signal and its strong immunity to noise is applied to detect useful signal in strong noise, and precisely determine its frequency and the signal-to-noise ratio is calculated as -28.6dB.

In scheme 1, AA is located after low noise amplifier (LNA), while in scheme 2, AA is placed before LNA. To reduce the noise figure (NF) in scheme 2, the method of reducing bias current of LNA was utilized. Through analyzing third-order intermodulation (IM3) when receiving strong signals, it demonstrates that scheme 2 can effectively improve DR upper bound and avoid receiver blocking. By comparing NF when receiving weak signals, it is shown that under certain conditions, the receiver sensitivity of scheme 2 is better than that of scheme 1.

The principle of weak signal detection with a background noise predictor is that the predictor trained by chaotic time series has a small prediction error, and the prediction error becomes relative large when the input contains a source or target. By exploiting the short-term predictability of the input signal, a one-step-ahead prediction model is proposed as the basis of designing an RBF neural network. To enhance the detection performance in noisy background, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to perform the training and better parameter estimates can be acquired compared to the conventional RBF network training method. The performance of detection for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed. Computer simulations show that the proposed method is effective for weak signal detection. © 2009 IEEE.","Chaotic prediction; Extended kalman filter; Radial basis function neural network; Weak signal detection","Background noise; Chaotic prediction; Chaotic time series; Detection performance; Input signal; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Parameter estimate; Prediction errors; Prediction model; Radial basis function neural network; Radial basis function neural networks; RBF Network; RBF Neural Network; Weak signal detection; Acoustic intensity; Attitude control; Cellular radio systems; Control theory; Error detection; Extended Kalman filters; Information management; Mining; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Signal detection",,,,,"Tesei, A., Signal detection in non-gaussian noise by a kurtosis-based probability density function model (1995) Sea; Nikias, C., Mendel, J.M., Signal processing with higher-order spectra (1993) IEE SP Mag., 10 (3), pp. 10-37. , doi: 10.1109/79.221324; Hinich, J., Wilson, G.R., Detection of non-gaussian signal in non-gaussian noise using the bispectrum (1990) Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 38 (7), pp. 1126-1131. , doi: 10.1109/29.57541; Xinhua, Z., Xiaoming, Z., Researches on chaotic phenomena of noises radiated from ships (1998) Acta Acústica, 23 (2), pp. 134-140; Yaan, L., Deming, X., A new way for detecting and recognizing underwater ship using takens theorem (2001) Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University, 19 (2), pp. 266-269; Takens, F., Detecting strange attractors in turbulence (1981) Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 898 (1), pp. 366-381. , doi: 0.1007/BFb0091903; Anderson, B., Moore, J.B., (1979) Optimal Filtering, , Englewood, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Kim, H.S., Eykholt, R., Salas, J.D., Nonlinear dynamics, delay times, and embedding windows (1999) Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 127 (1-2), pp. 48-60. , doi: 10.1016/S0167-2789(98)00240-1","Junyang, P.; Marine College, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China; email: panjunyang@gmail.com",,,,"2009 2nd International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, WKKD 2009","23 January 2009 through 25 January 2009","Moscow",76108,,9780769535432,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

It describes a topology of wireless mobile network and the handoff process as an ordinary process in that type of networks which may cause segments losses. Approach: Wireless mobile networks have many weaknesses related to bit error, network congestion and weak signals that cause segments losses as well as handoff process. For this reason, wireless mobile network TCP cannot distinguish between losses caused by these weaknesses or by the handoff process. So in handoff case, segments losses will trigger congestion control algorithms that reduce the TCP connection's throughput performance. Results: However, in addition to the previous efforts that provide different algorithms and protocols which aim to come up with different solutions and enhancements for the TCP connection in wireless mobile networks when handoff occurs, I am providing in this study Div-TCP protocol that runs the ordinary TCP algorithms with adding more operations that are concerned to handoff. These operations aim to maintain a suitable RTO at each sender to avoid triggering congestions algorithms and also to maintain the sender's throughput by establishing a TCP connection prior to the handoff occurrence. Conclusions/Recommendations: The protocol's discussion shows how end-to-end TCP connection became more efficient since the new Div-TCP connection after handoff will have good and already built TCP connection and the RTO is too much high at all nodes so there is no fear of a that TCP considers congestion. © 2008 Science Publications.","Congestion control; Correspondent host; Exponential back off; Foreign agent; Handoff; Home agent; Mobile IP; Mobile node; Retransmission time out; Round trip time; TCP connection",,,,,,"Kurose, J.F., Ross, K.W., (2004) Computer Networking: A Top-down Approach Featuring the Internet, , 3rd Edn.

When two signals are sampled by nonuniform sampling, and the amplitude of one signal is above 10% smaller than that of the other, the weak signal cannot be detected from the mixed signal's spectrum because of sampling's fake-randomicity. Because independent component analysis (ICA) was immune to signal's amplitude, the weak signal could be detected from the mixed signal's spectrum with two input source signals. One input source signal was the mixed signal itself, and the other was a constructed signal of which the frequency was equal to that of the strong signal. The weak signal, of which the amplitude was five million times smaller than the strong one, was separated from the mixed signal's spectrum by the FastICA algorithm. A phase-scanning method using cross correlation was adopted to solve the strong signal's phase matching. A weak signal, of which the amplitude was 0.06% smaller than that of the strong signal, was separated from the mixed signal, as the relative error of phase matching was 0.70%.","Independent component analysis (IGA); Nonuniform sampling; Phase matching; Weak signal detection","Analog to digital conversion; Frequency domain analysis; Independent component analysis; Nyquist diagrams; Phase matching; Sampling; Input source signals; Mixed signal; Nonuniform sampling; Weak signal detection; Signal detection",,,,,"Ferreira, P.J.S.G., Nonuniform sampling of nonbandlimited signals (1995) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2 (5), pp. 89-91; Liu, L., Xie, J., Zhang, J., A kind of direct reconstruction method for nonuniform sampling signal (2001) Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument, 22 (3), pp. 61-62. , Chinese source; Liu, L., Xie, J., Wang, M., A kind of reconstruction method for non-uniform sampling image (2002) Computer Engineering and Applications, 38 (22), pp. 119-121. , Chinese source; Venkataramani, R., Bresler, Y., Optimal sun-Nyquist nonuniform sampling and reconstruction for multiplan signals (2001) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 49 (10), pp. 2301-2313; He, P., Chen, G., Advanced method on the reconstruction of nonuniformly sampled periodic signal based on the windowing parameter estimation and adaptive iterative algorithm (2002) Systems Engineering and Electronics, 24 (2), pp. 96-98. , Chinese source; Sun, S., Chu, R., Spectrum analysis of nonuniformly sampled signals (1998) Systems Engineering and Electronics, 20 (5), pp. 14-17. , Chinese source; Wang, A., Wang, S., Chen, M., A novel spectrum analysis method for nonuniform periodically sampling (2005) Signal Processing, 21 (3), pp. 240-243. , Chinese source; Wang, A., Wang, S., Chen, M., Study on spectrum of nonuniform sampling signals based on wavelet transform (2005) Journal of Electronics and Information Technology, 27 (3), pp. 427-430. , Chinese source; Wang, A., Wang, S., Chen, M., A novel method for signal detection based on nonuniform sampling (2004) Signal Processing, 20 (5), pp. 436-440. , Chinese source; Jutten, C., Herault, J., Blind separation of sources.

Computed tomographic scans and 3-dimensional reconstructions are the optimal tools for evaluation of the bony structures. However, there is no equivalent method for the orbital soft tissues. The aim of this study was to establish a 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3-D MRI) technique that allows a differentiated visualization of the different types of soft tissue in the orbit. A total of 8 patients with different pathologic conditions of the orbit was examined. Five of these patients underwent secondary correction after trauma, and 3 had craniofacial malformations. The 3-D reconstruction was performed in the volume-rendering technique after acquisition of 3-mm axial slices. It was shown that a differentiated visualization of the orbital soft tissues is possible. Although the thin bony structures have a weak signal and, therefore, the imaging is poor, reliable reconstruction of the globe was achieved by different radiologists because of its circular delimitation from the bone. This technique is an additional support in the planning of orbital surgery.",,"article; craniofacial malformation; extraocular muscle; eye; human; maxillofacial injury; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oculomotor nerve; optic nerve; orbit; pathology; preoperative care; three dimensional imaging; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Eye; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Maxillofacial Injuries; Oculomotor Muscles; Oculomotor Nerve; Optic Nerve; Orbit; Preoperative Care",,,,,,"Kleinheinz, J.",,,,,,,,07421931,,,"11307225","English","Int J Adult Orthodon Orthognath Surg",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034157458

The main themes were identified. Alceste improves a corpus' characterization and allows a logical reading of it, thanks to the creation of categories, along with their mutual dependencies, the peculiar meaning of each and their division in time. Moreover, Alceste allows us to perceive the contexts of the contents previously identified under Leximappe. Sampler allows us to go into the details of the terms association in graphical form and detail the specific orientations of the corpus, especially with the inscription of weak signals. Finally, this software, applied from the categories drawn from Alceste, offers for each category a meaningful graphic representation. We can argue that the different ways of measuring and presenting results are complementary since they highlight different aspects of risk assessment carried by different actors, as it is underlined in social science studies of public controversy. Moreover we can follow these actors through the categories and clusters (socioeconomic, scientific and risk assessment linked to regulation and policy) which are more and more differenciated in time.

In order to identify more novel biomarkers and understand biological mechanisms, it is vital to detect signals weakly associated with outcomes among ultrahigh-dimensional predictors. However, existing screening methods, which typically ignore correlation information, are likely to miss weak signals. By incorporating the inter-feature dependence, a covariance-insured screening approach is proposed to identify predictors that are jointly informative but marginally weakly associated with outcomes. The validity of the method is examined via extensive simulations and a real data study for selecting potential genetic factors related to the onset of multiple myeloma. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Covariance-insured screening; Dimensionality reduction; High-dimensional data; Variable selection","Computational methods; Data handling; Biological mechanisms; Dimensionality reduction; Extensive simulations; High dimensional data; High-throughput data; Screening approaches; Screening methods; Variable selection; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"Berisa, T., Pickrell, J., Approximately independent linkage disequilibrium blocks in human populations (2016) Bioinformatics, 32 (2), pp. 283-285; Bickel, P., Levina, E., Covariance regularization by thresholding (2008) Ann.

To improve the performance of weak signal detector, AFI is convolved with noisy samples which (i.e., AFI) attenuates the noise because of its low-pass filtering nature. SR noise (i.e., some fixed amount of noise) is added externally, which causes further improvement in detection. The external noise under SR has been obtained in Neyman–Pearson (NP) framework. For comparison, receiver operating characteristic curve has been analysed. The parameters, probability of detection (P D ) and deflection coefficient ratio are also calculated at a fixed value of probability of false alarm (P FA ). It has been observed that the performance of the proposed detector is better or comparable to most of the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Approximated fractional integrator; Asymmetric noise; Receiver operating characteristic curve; Signal detection; Stochastic resonance","Circuit resonance; Low pass filters; Magnetic resonance; Signal receivers; Stochastic systems; Asymmetric noise; Deflection coefficient; Fractional integrators; Probability of detection; Probability of false alarm; Receiver operating characteristic curves; State-of-the-art techniques; Stochastic resonances; Signal detection",,,,,"Chen, H., Varshney, P.K., Kay, S.M., Michels, J.H., Theory of stochastic resonance effects in signal detection: Part I-fixed detectors (2007) IEEE Trans.

The SAFADOF is able to significantly amplify very weak laser signals and reject noise in order to obtain clean signals in strong background. We show that for a weak signal of 50 pW, the gain factor can be larger than 25000 (44 dB) within a bandwidth as narrow as 13 MHz. Having the ability to amplify weak signals with low background contribution, the SAFADOF finds outstanding potential applications in weak signal detections. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Ohman, Y., On some new auxiliary instruments in astrophysical research VI.

In particular, we focus on global testing against sparse alternatives for the means of binary outcomes following an Ising model, and establish how the interplay between the strength and sparsity of a signal determines its detectability under various notions of dependence. The profound impact of dependence is best illustrated under the Curie-Weiss model where we observe the effect of a “thermodynamic” phase transition. In particular, the critical state exhibits a subtle “blessing of dependence” phenomenon in that one can detect much weaker signals at criticality than otherwise. Furthermore, we develop a testing procedure that is broadly applicable to account for dependence and show that it is asymptotically minimax optimal under fairly general regularity conditions. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2018.","Detection boundary; Ising models; Phase transitions; Sparse signals",,,,,,"Addario-Berry, L., Broutin, N., Devroye, L., Lugosi, G., On combinatorial testing problems (2010) Ann.

These techniques rely on accurate synchronization of signals broadcast from neighboring base stations. Therefore, the latters must have access to reliable and accurate time reference. GNSS signals can be used to provide a reliable global time reference in open sky conditions. However, owing to low levels of signals indoors, the detection and processing of these signals and obtaining an accurate time indoors are still a challenge. It is assumed that accurate position estimates are known for indoor static applications which are obtained either using GNSS or other indoor positioning technologies. Under this assumption, fine timing solution can be provided with reliable single satellite information. As such this paper characterizes GPS based measurement and timing accuracies for indoor signals. This study specifically focuses on assessing range and timing accuracies for static indoor locations. Actual GPS data was collected at two indoor sites having different indoor characteristics for duration of more than ten minutes at each site. Assuming a known user position, measurement accuracies are analyzed over time while simultaneously observing received signal power. Ranging (timing) accuracy in the order of 10 m (30 ns) was achievable for the indoor scenarios considered. Finally, to assess the capability of indoor measurements to sustain good time synchronization accuracy over a longer duration, two-minute data segments were collected at intervals of 30 minutes for three hours. The time variations of the pseudorange (time) and position errors are studied. © 2018 IEEE.","GNSS; Range; synchronization; Time; Weak signal","Signal detection; Synchronization; Emerging applications; Global time reference; GNSS; Range; Satellite information; Time; Time synchronization; Weak signals; Global positioning system",,,,,"Seco-Granados, G., López-Salcedo, J., Jiménez-Baños, D., López-Risueño, G., Challenges in indoor global navigation satellite systems: Unveiling its core features in signal processing IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29 (2), pp. 108-131; Kay, S., Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing - Detection Theory, 2. , Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall PTR; Diggelen, V.F., (2009) A-GPS: Assisted GPS, GNSS, and SBAS, , Boston: Artech House; Clerk-Maxwell, J., (1892) A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, 2, pp. 68-73. , 3rd ed., Oxford: Clarendon; De-Grasse, M., DAS and small cell update (2015) RCR Wireless News, pp. 2-6. , http://www.rcrwireless.com/category/freereports, Retrieved from; Miles, A., Fenger, C., GNSS Timing and the Rise of Small Cells, , https://www.ublox.com/sites/default/files/GNSSTimingRiseSmallCells_WhitePaper_(UBX-13005008).pdf, ublox.

Most EMG acquisition systems use the wired transmission mode, so signals are easily contaminated by power line frequency interference. In addition, the sEMG is relatively weak. It is essential to make amplifying, filtering and denoising for sEMG pre-processing. In this paper, a four-channel wireless sEMG acquisition system with high accuracy, low latency, portable, lithium battery and wireless data transmission is designed. And it integrates lithium battery charging and discharging system, acquisition of weak signal as well as pre-processing of filter circuit. Besides, this system's interference of noise is small. And high single channel SNR can avoid power frequency interference. It can provide EMG signal processing with convenient platform, which creates the hardware condition for the research of the follow up surface EMG signal processing. © 2017 IEEE.","EMG acquisition; sEMG; wireless communication","Lithium batteries; Secondary batteries; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Acquisition systems; Battery charging and discharging; EMG acquisition; EMG signal processing; sEMG; Transmission mode; Wireless communications; Wireless data transmission; Biomedical signal processing",,,,,"Lu, L., Yin, T., Jin, J.N., Li, Y., Feasibility study of surface EMG signal acquisition in action recognition (2011) Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research and Clinical Rehabilitation, 15, pp. 4103-4106; Wu, L., Huang, P.C., Bao, G.J., Yang, Q.H., SEMG signal analysis method and its application in rehabilitation medicine (2011) Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, 28, pp. 1368-1373; Liu, Y.H., Huang, H.P., Towards a high-stability EMG recognition system for prosthesis control: A one-class classification based nontarget EMG pattern filtering scheme (2009) Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE International Conference, pp. 4752-4757; He, H., Zhou, P., Li, G., An analysis of emg electrode configuration for targeted muscle reinnervation based neural machine interface (2008) Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 16, pp. 37-45; Yu, S., Fisher Mark, H., Towards an EMG-Controlled Prosthetic Hand Using a 3-D Electromagnetic Positioning System (2005) Instrumentation and Measurement, 56, pp. 178-186; Kap, K., An emg-based robot control scheme robust to time-varying emg signal features (2010) Information Technology in Biomedicine, 14, pp. 582-588; Zhy, Z., Chen, X., Array surface emg signal acquisition instrument (2009) Modern Scientific Instruments, 23, pp. 88-94; Youn, W., Kim, J., Development of a compact-size and wireless surface EMG measurement system (2009) ICCAS-SICE, pp. 1625-1628; Hao, Z., Changyu, X., Design of front-end processing circuit and acquisition system for surface electromyography signal (2008) Measurement and Control Technology, 3, pp. 37-40; Wei, H., Design of wireless multi-channel surface emg acquisition system (2009) Journal of Electronic Measurement &Instrument, 11, pp. 30-35",,,"IEEE;Sichuan Institute of Electronics","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications, ICCC 2017","13 December 2017 through 16 December 2017",,135473,,9781509063505,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In this paper, the applicability of weak signals and wild cards is experimented in a case of a highly reliable and conservative sector, water and sanitation services. The aim is to explore an approach suitable for water utilities. The paper discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches to weak signals and wild cards, and reflects these in relation to the chosen approach. It is argued that the process of weak signals and wild cards can serve as a communication and reflection exercise for an organisation like a water utility. Furthermore, incorporating weak signals and wild cards can be an essential part in futures thinking, challenge prevailing mental models, and make systems more open to sense and learn from their environment. It is recommended for water utilities to apply a loose approach on weak signals and wild cards and embed it as a part of their organisational culture. However, it should be remembered that the approach should always be chosen to match the overall objectives and context. © 2017, The Author(s).","Water and sanitation services; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Hiltunen, E., (2010) Weak signals in organizational futures learning, , Aalto University School of Economics, Dissertation; Miller, R., Rossel, P., Jorgensen, U., Future studies and weak signals: a critical survey (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 195-197; Holopainen, M., Toivonen, M., Weak signals: Ansoff today (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 198-205; Mendonça, S., Cardoso, G., Caraça, J., The strategic strength of weak signal analysis (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 218-228; Rossel, P., Early detection, warnings, weak signals and seeds of change: a turbulent domain of futures studies (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 229-239; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The big picture – trends, drivers, wild cards, discontinuities and weak signals (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 292-312; Cevolini, A., The strongness of weak signals: self-reference and paradox in anticipatory systems (2016) Eur J Futures res, 4, pp. 1-13; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Slaughter, R.A., A new framework for environmental scanning (1999) Foresight, 1, pp. 441-451; Popper, R., Foresight methodology (2008) The Handbook of technology foresight: concepts and practice, pp. 44-88. , Georghiou L, Harper JC, Keenan M, Miles I, Popper R, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision making (2009) Technol Anal Strateg, 21, pp. 307-320; Pieper, K.J., Tang, M., Edwards, M.A., Flint water crisis caused by interrupted corrosion control: investigating ""ground zero"" home (2017) Environmental Science & Technology, 51, p. 2007; Saritas, O., Proskuryakova, L., Water resources – an analysis of trends, weak signals and wild cards with implications for Russia (2017) Foresight, 19, pp. 152-173; Nafday, A.M., Strategies for managing the consequences of black swan events (2009) Leader Manag Eng, 9, pp. 191-197; Kahneman, D., (2011) Thinking, fast and slow, , Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York; Taleb, N.N., (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, , Random House, New York; Heino, O.A., Takala, A.J., Katko, T.S., Challenges to Finnish water and wastewater services in the next 20–30 years (2011) E-Water, 1, pp. 1-20; Dominguez, D., (2008) Handling future uncertainty - strategic planning for the infrastructure sector, , Dissertation, ETH Zurich; Meadows, D.H., Wright, D., (2008) Thinking in systems: a primer, , Chelsea Green, White River Junction; Rognerud, I., Fonseca, C., van der, K.A., Moriarty, P., (2016) IRC trends analysis, 2016–2025; Ravetz, J., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2011) ERA toolkit: applications of wild cards and weak signals to the grand challenges & thematic priorities of the European research area, , Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, University of Manchester; Swyngedouw, E., (2004) Social power and the urbanization of water: flows of power, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Castro, J.E., Systemic conditions and public policy in the water and sanitation sector (2009) Water and sanitation services, pp. 19-37. , Castro JE, Heller L, (eds), Earthscan, London; Slaughter, R.A., From forecasting and scenarios to social construction: changing methodological paradigms in futures studies (2002) Foresight, 4, pp. 26-31; Miles, I., Harper, J.C., Georghiou, L., Keenan, M., Popper, R., The many faces of foresight (2008) The Handbook of technology foresight: concepts and practice, pp. 3-23. , Georghiou L, Harper JC, Keenan M, Miles I, Popper R, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting strategic management, , Prentice/Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Könnölä, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., van Rij, V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39, pp. 208-221; Moijanen, M., Heikot signaalit tulevaisuuden tutkimuksessa.

Whereas previous research on the effect of bilateral investment treaties (BIT) on capital flows has focused almost exclusively on direct foreign investment (DFI), this article examines total flows of all types. It also asks a question ignored by previous studies: Do investment treaties affect the cost that a developing country must pay for the capital it receives? Instead of viewing investment treaties as just international legal instruments prescribing rights and duties, the article also examines their role as information to international capital markets. Relying on insights from the economics of information and signaling theory, it argues that investment treaties influence capital flows through the signals they send to international capital markets. Accordingly, it creates a model of a ""Strong BIT Signal Country"" and proceeds to identify twenty-six countries that fit the model, while identifying for comparative purposes fifteen countries deemed to be ""Weak Signal BIT Countries. ""An analysis of capital flows to both groups of countries finds that the Strong Signal BIT Countries experienced significant increased capital inflows following the completion of their BIT negotiation program and also reveals that they outperformed the Weak Signal BIT countries in this respect. Using data on sovereign credit ratings and World Bank governance indicators on the rule of law, the author also finds that several countries experienced an improvement in both indicators following the conclusion of their BIT programs, leading to the inference that such improvement might also be associated with a reduction in a country's risk premium and therefore a decline in its cost of capital.",,,,,,,"Salacuse, J.W., (2015) The Law of Investment Treaties, p. 3. , 2d ed; (2015) World Investment Report, p. 109. , UNCTAD; Sornarajah, M., An international investment court: Panacea or purgatory, No. 180 (2016) Columbia FDI Perspectives, p. 1. , http://ccsi.columbia.edu/fiIes/2013/10/No-180-Sornarajah-FINAL.pdf, Aug. 15; BG Grp.

The time horizon of planning is short-Term, the strategic way of thinking beyond 7-10 years long period is missing or it has great deficiencies. It is not even considering the long-Term opportunities. Therefore, the short term plans are not derived from established perspectives, they do not have sufficient grounds. This paper briefly summarises the achievements of a research activity to make an attempt to prove that despite the limitations in understanding and unfolding the future, it is possible to provide useful information for the planning of rural development in 20-30 years or even on several more years.

Similarly, detecting case-control differences in co-expression among genes can be critical to understanding complex human diseases; however, statistical methods have been limited by the high-dimensional nature of this problem. In this paper, we construct a sparse-Leading-Eigenvalue-Driven (sLED) test for comparing two high-dimensional covariance matrices. By focusing on the spectrum of the differential matrix, sLED provides a novel perspective that accommodates what we assume to be common, namely sparse and weak signals in gene expression data, and it is closely related with sparse principal component analysis. We prove that sLED achieves full power asymptotically under mild assumptions, and simulation studies verify that it outperforms other existing procedures under many biologically plausible scenarios. Applying sLED to the largest gene-expression dataset obtained from post-mortem brain tissue from Schizophrenia patients and controls, we provide a novel list of genes implicated in Schizophrenia and reveal intriguing patterns in gene co-expression change for Schizophrenia subjects. We also illustrate that sLED can be generalized to compare other gene-gene “relationship” matrices that are of practical interest, such as the weighted adjacency matrices. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2017.","Covariance matrix; High-dimensional data; Permutation test; Sparse principal component analysis",,,,,,"Anderson, T.W., (1958) An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis, , Wiley, New York.

After the pilot channel is added to the modernized navigation signal, the coherence integral time can be prolonged to improve the acquisition sensitivity, but it is also restrained by the rapid change of carrier doppler which is caused by the high dynamic of receiver. For this problem, a quantitative analysis of the reduction of acquisition search range which is the effort of inertial information aiding will be made firstly. Secondly, a new modernized data/pilot joint acquisition algorithm which is aided by inertial information and a pilot single channel acquisition algorithm will be proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively resist the energy decay caused by the rapid change of doppler frequency, improve the sensitivity, reduce the computational complexity and enhance the acquisition ability of high dynamic and weak signals. © 2017 IEEE.","Acquisition; GNSS; High dynamic; INS; Modernized; Weak signal","Indium; Navigation; Signal receivers; Acquisition; GNSS; High dynamic; Modernized; Weak signals; Signal processing",,,,,"Zhu, L.F., Zhang, B., Ma, Z.Q., Research on hardware-in-the-Ioop simulation of INS-aided GPS fast acquisition under high dynamic environment [J] (2011) Journal of Astronautics, 32 (1), pp. 150-156; Shi, R.H., Yu, C., Dong, J., A fast acquisition algorithrn for COMPASS satellite signals in high dynarnic environment [J] (2015) Application Research of Computers, 32 (5), pp. 1454-1457; He, X.F., Nie, Z.G., Yu, H.Y., Performance analysis on high dynamic signal acquisition aided by SINS for GNSS satellites [J] (2011) Journal of Chinese Inertial Technology, 19 (4), pp. 447-451; Zhang, Q.S., (2010) Research on Fast Acquisition Algorithm of Assisted GPS [D], pp. 29-33. , Beijing: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Zuo, Q.Y., (2008) Research of the Tracking of High Dynamic GPS Signal[D], pp. 4-5. , Beijing: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kubrak, O., Monnerat, M., Artaud, G., Improvement of GNSS signal acquisition using low-cost inertial sensors[C] (2008) The Institute of Navigation.

In order to achieve this goal, a multiple case-study strategy is employed which combines the qualitative with the quantitative perspective. The results prove that 78.10% of the variability of the managerial early warning system reliability can be explained by managers' influence and company's size; the first one is negatively correlated with system's reliability while the latest is positively correlated with system's reliability. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications. On the one hand, they extend the literature regarding managers' participation in the process of developing the future corporate strategy. On the other hand, they offer a better understanding on how managers may influence not only the identification of the weak signals but also the development of scenarios and forecasted business results. © 2018 by IGI Global.

In this paper, non-destructive magnetic flux leakage detection technology is used to replace the CCD detection method to collect data. And then we use the image conversion technology to convert the data into images. After that, the image processing technology is used to detect the defects and extract the features. Finally, the BP neural network defect identification model is constructed to identify the defects. The simulation results show that the trained model has a strong ability to recognize length, width and depth of the defects. The new method can effectively detect and identify low-contrast and small defects in the weak signal, which can furtherly improve the detection resolution and sensitivity. © 2017 IEEE.","BP neural network; Defect recognition; Feature extraction; Multi-scale edge detection; Wavelet transform",,,,,,"Petcher, P.A., Dixon, S., Weld defect detection using PPM EMAT generated shear horizontal ultrasound[J] (2015) NDT&E International, 8, pp. 58-65; Liu, B., Cao, Y., Zhang, H., Weak magnetic flux leakage: A possible method for studying pipeline defects located either inside or outside the structures[J] (2015) NDT & E International, 74, pp. 81-86; Gao, B., Woo, W.L., He, Y., Unsupervised sparse pattern diagnostic of defects with inductive thermography imaging system[J] (2015) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 12 (1), pp. 371-383; Ahanian, I., Sadeghi, S.H.H., Moini, R., An array waveguide probe for detection, location and sizing of surface cracks in metals[J] (2015) NDT & E International, 70, pp. 38-40; Jin, R., Yin, J., Zhou, W., Yang, J., Improved multiscale edge detection method for polarimetric SAR images[J] (2016) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 13 (8), pp. 1104-1108; Florez-Ospina, J.F., Benitez-Restrepo, H.D., Toward images of composites and honeycomb structures[J] (2015) Infrared Physics & Technology, 71, pp. 99-112; Hu, Y., Chen, J., Pan, D., Edge-guided image object detection in multiscale segmentation for high-resolution remotely sensed imagery[J] (2016) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience & Remote Sensing, 54 (8), pp. 4702-4711; Fatan, M., Daliri, M.R., Shahri, A.M., Underwater cable detection in the images using edge classification based on texture information[J] (2016) Measurement, 91, pp. 309-317; Tang, Q., Dai, J., Liu, J., Quantitative detection of defects based on Markov-PCA-BP algorithm using pulsed infrared thermography technology[J] (2016) Infrared Physics & Technology, 77, pp. 144-148; He, Y.L., Wang, X., Zhu, Q.X., Modeling of acetic acid content in purified terephthalic acid solvent column using principal component analysis based improved extreme learning machine[J] (2015) Control Theory & Application, 32 (1), pp. 80-85; Huang, G.B., Extreme learning machine for regression and multiclass classification[J] (2012) IEEE Trans on Systems, 42 (2), pp. 513-516; Ding, G., Zhong, S.S., Time series prediction based on process neural networks and its applications[J] (2006) Control and Decision, 21 (9), pp. 1037-1041; Long, B., Jiang, X.W., Song, Z.J., Study for multiple fault diagnosis technology for spacecrafts based on multi-signal model[J] (2004) J of Astronautics, 25 (5), pp. 591-594; Ding, G., Zhong, S.S., Time series prediction based on process neural networks and its applications[J] (2006) Control and Decision, 21 (9), pp. 1037-1041; Wang, C., Wang, J.H., Improved hybrid incremental extreme learning machine algorithm[J] (2015) Control and Decision, 30 (11), pp. 1982-1985","Wang, Z.-S.; Institute of Petroleum and Chemical, Shenyang University of TechnologyChina; email: 22729883@163.com",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","29th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2017","28 May 2017 through 30 May 2017",,129162,,9781509046560,,,"English","Proc.

The method uses the matching filter based on the model which describes the cases of small quantity of samples for channel impulses, voltage shifts and correlated white noise for each photo element.

We chose the milk market as a case study, in line with the recent call from the EU Commission for governance tools which help to better address such highly volatile markets. Furthermore, on the first of April 2015, the new Common Agricultural Policy ended quotas for milk, which led to a milk crisis in the EU. Thus, we collaborated with milk experts to get their inputs for a new model to analyse the competitive environment. Consequently, we constructed graphs to represent the major factors that affect the milk industry and the relationships between them. We obtained several network measures for this social network, such as centrality and density. Some factors appear to have the largest major influence on all the other graph elements, while others strongly interact in cliques. Any detected changes in any of these factors will automatically impact the others. Therefore, scanning ones competitive environment can allow an organisation to get an early warning to help it avoid an issue (as much as possible) and/or seize an opportunity before its competitors. We conclude that Strategic Early Warning Systems as a corporate foresight approach utilising graph theory can strengthen the governance of markets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate foresight; Graph theory; Milk market; Scanning; Scenario analysis; Strategic Early Warning System","commodity market; corporate strategy; crisis management; early warning system; European Union; governance approach; graphical method; milk; scenario analysis; France",,,,,"Organizations make strides in adoption of analytics, but struggle to capitalize on investments.

However, the signal propagation from the 802.11n AP may not be uniform in the circumferential direction because of multiple antennas in MIMO, in addition to the height direction. As a result, the data transmission speed between the AP and a host can be significantly affected by their relative setup conditions. In this paper, we propose a minimax approach for optimizing the 802.11n AP setup condition in terms of the angles and the height in an indoor environment using throughput measurements. First, we detect a bottleneck host that receives the weakest signal from the AP in the field using the throughput estimation model. Then, we optimize the AP setup by changing the orientation and height while measuring throughputs. For evaluations, we confirm the accuracy of the model using measurement results and the throughput improvements at most hosts including the bottleneck one in the field by our approach. © 2016 IEEE.","Access-point setup; IEEE 802.11n; MIMO; Throughput estimation; Wireless local area network","Data communication systems; Data transfer; Optimization; Throughput; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Access points; Circumferential direction; Data-transmission speed; High-speed data transmission; IEEE 802.11n; Multiple-input multiple-output technologies; Throughput improvement; Throughput measurements; MIMO systems",,,,,"Gast, M.S., (2012) 802.11n: A Survival Guide, , 1st ed., O'Reilly; Jensen, M.A., Wallace, J.W., A review of antennas and propagation for MIMO wireless communications (2004) IEEE Trans.

In a set of reviews, the review with the most helpfulness votes are seen as most helpful. While researchers have demonstrated how review and reviewer characteristics influence helpfulness votes, a largely uninvestigated issue is how herding behaviors can influence customers’ voting participation and direction. Drawing on herd behavior literature, we propose that review voters will discount their own information when faced with clear and strong signals from previous voters. Thus, they will herd previous voters’ voting direction. On the other hand, review voters will value their own judgments when faced with weak signals from previous voters. Herding can influence both a voter’s perception of a review’s helpfulness and his/her vote. This research extends review helpfulness literature that herd behaviors could moderates customers’ perception of review helpfulness and voting direction. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.

The conventional methods of parallel code phase search acquisition with coherent, non-coherent and differential coherent detection for weak signal acquisition fail to enhance the signal for all conditions especially, when the Carrier to Noise ratio (C/N 0 ) falls below 15 dB-Hz. Hence, the GPS receiver has to employ sophisticated techniques to excise the noise and to improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the signal for further processing. In this paper, a pre-filtering technique of reduced rank Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) is proposed for noise excision and is processed through coherent, non-coherent and differential detection postcorrelation methods to retrieve the signal embedded in noise. Monte Carlo simulations carried out to examine the acquisition sensitivity at various power levels with the different postcorrelation approaches indicate that the SSA combined with differential detection approach provides a significant performance improvement with lesser mean acquisition time. It has 96% probability of detection at a worst signal power level of −159 dBm (i.e. C/N 0 15 dB-Hz), compared to other conventional methods. © 2014 The Authors","GPS; Singular Spectral Analysis; Weak GPS signal acquisition",,,,,,"Braasch, M.S., Van Dierendonck, A.J., GPS receiver architecture and measurements (1999) Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, best international practice was analyzed that provided a solid basis for Russian S&T Foresight 2030 (section “Nanotechnology and new materials”). The study used a wide range of advanced Foresight methods adapted to Russian circumstances. During the Foresight study, the authors integrated “market pull” and research “technology push” approaches including both traditional methods (priority-setting, roadmaps, global challenges analysis) and relatively new approaches (horizon scanning, weak signals, wild cards, etc.). Findings: Using the methods of the Foresight, the authors identified trends with the greatest impact on the sphere of nanotechnology and new materials, promising markets, product groups and potential areas of demand for Russian innovation technologies and developments in this field. The authors assessed the state-of-the-art of the domestic research in the area of nanotechnologies and new materials to identify “white spots”, as well as parity zone and leadership, which can be the basis for integration into international alliances and positioning of Russia as a center of global technological development in this field. Originality/value: The results of applying Foresight methodology toward revelation of the most prospective S&T areas in the field of nanotechnologies and new materials can be used by a variety of stakeholders including federal and regional authorities, technology platforms and innovation and industrial clusters, leading universities and scientific organizations in formulation of their research and strategic agenda. Russian businesses including both large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises can use results of the study in creating their strategic R&D programs and finding appropriate partners. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advanced materials; Convergence; Foresight; Nanotechnologies; NBIC technologies; New materials",,,,,,"Nanotechnology (2006) The Industrial Revolution of the 21st Century; (2004) Nanotechnology Foresight in Asia-Pacific, , The APEC Center for Technology Foresight, Bangkok; (2008) Energy and Nanotechnologies: Strategy for Australia’s Future, , Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, Melbourne; Batra, V.S., Li, H.P., Oxygen carrier materials and their role in chemical looping reactions for fuel conversion (2017) Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering, 15, pp. 44-48; Cuhls, K., Blind, K., Grupp, H., Delphi ’98 umfrage (1998) Zukunft Nachgefragt, , (Eds Studie zur globalen Entwicklung von Wissenschaft und Technik, Karlsruhe (in German); (2010) Research Road Mapping in Materials, , European Commission, Brussels; Di Sia, P., Analytical nano-modelling for neuroscience and cognitive science (2014) Journal of Bioinformatics and Intelligent Control, 3 (4), pp. 268-272; Diallo, M.S., Brinker, J.C., Nanotechnology for sustainability: environment, water, food, minerals and climate (2011) Nanotechnology Research Directions for Societal Needs in 2020: Retrospective and Outlook, pp. 221-259. , Roco, M.C., Mirkin, M.C. and Hersham, M.and (Eds), Science Policy Reports, Springer, Dordrecht; (2010) US Department of Energy Critical Materials Strategy, , Department of Energy, The United States of America, Washington, DC; (2006) Roadmaps at 2015 on Nanotechnology Application in the Sectors of Materials, Health & Medical Systems, Energy, , AIRI / Nanotec IT, Roma; Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: an action plan for Europe 2005-2009“ (2009) Second Implementation Report 2007-2009, , http://cordis.europa.eu/nanotechnology/actionplan.htm, (accessed, 6 April 2016, Commission of the European Communities, Brussels; The global nanotechnology and nanomaterials industry: stage of development (2013) Global Activity and Market Opportunities; (2014) Nanomanufacturing: Emergence and Implications for US Competitiveness, the Environment, and Human Health, , www.gao.gov/assets/670/660591.pdf, (accessed, 25 February 2016, United States Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC; Goh, P.S., Ismail, A.F., Review: is interplay between nanomaterial and membrane technology the way forward for desalination?

Pre-operational CNAV broadcast is made available to support development of L2C signal processing capability in modernized GPS receivers. The transmission of synchronized L1 C/A and L2C codes by Block IIR-M and follow-on generations of GPS satellites allows GPS receiver designers to develop correlators for combined acquisition of the two signals to achieve additional detection sensitivity when compared to processing an individual signal. One of the key challenges in this joint acquisition is the processing complexity or cost of Doppler search to be conducted over the synchronized data-bit intervals of 20 milliseconds in each of the L1 and L2C channels. To date, researchers have addressed this problem by limiting the coherent correlation interval to a 1ms period, thereby reducing the Doppler search space while combining the outcomes of 20 coherent correlations through non-coherent and differentially-coherent processing techniques to compensate the effect of residual Doppler appearing across the data-bit interval in each of the L1 and L2C channels. These solutions however compromise the signal-tonoise-ratio when compared to fully coherent processing of signals over 20 milliseconds. In this paper, we propose complex-averaging of L1 and L2C signals at the IF stage to reduce the sampling rate of the Doppler signal, and accomplish the Doppler search at a low processing cost without compromising the detection performance of individual channels. The scheme is evaluated theoretically as well as validated through experiments on real GPS signals broadcast by Block IIR-M satellites. The proposed processing approach allows GPS receivers to detect weaker signals through low-power processors. © 2016 IEEE.","Averaging; Combined signal acquisition; Computational complexity; Doppler search; GPS L1 C/A and L2C signals; Signal detection performance; Signal processing rate","C (programming language); Computational complexity; Correlation detectors; Correlators; Global positioning system; IIR filters; Information systems; Military communications; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Averaging; Detection performance; Detection sensitivity; Doppler; Processing complexity; Signal acquisitions; Signal processing capability; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Signal detection",,,,,"(2016) Navigation, and Timing Policy with Program Update 10th Annual Baška GNSS Conference, pp. 8-10. , http://www.gps.gov/multimedia/presentations/2016/05/baska/moskoff.pdf, Baška, Krk Island, Croatia, May; Tran, M., Performance evaluations of the new GPS L5 and L2 Civil (L2C) signals (2004) Navigation, 51 (3), pp. 199-212; Fontana, R.D., Cheung, W., Novak, P.M., The new L2 civil signal (2001) Proceedings of ION GPS Salt Lake City, pp. 617-631. , UT; Leveson, I., Benefits of the new GPS civil signal: The L2C study (2006) Inside GNSS, pp. 42-47. , July/August; (2013) Global Positioning System Interface Specification NAVSTAR, , IS GPS 200 200H, September 24; Borio, D., A statistical theory for GNSS signal acquisition (2008) Doctoral Thesis, Politecnico di Torino, Italy; Dempster, A.G., Correlators for L2C: Some considerations (2006) Inside GNSS, pp. 32-37. , October; Gernot, C., O'Keefe, K., Lachapelle, G., Comparison of L1 C/A L2C combined acquisition techniques (2008) Proceedings of European Navigation Conference, Toulouse; Gernot, C., Shanmugam, S.K., O'Keefe, K., Lachapelle, G., A novel L1 and L2C combined detection scheme for enhanced GPS acquisition (2007) Proceedings of ION GNSS 20th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division, pp. 219-230. , Fort Worth TX; Gernot, C., O'Keefe, K., Lachapelle, G., Assessing three new GPS combined L1/L2C acquisition methods"" (2011) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 48 (3), 47 (3), pp. 2239-2247; Ta, T.H., Ngo, S.H., A novel signal acquisition method for GPS dual-frequency Ll CIA and L2C receivers 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications; Ta, T.H., Pini, M., Presti, L.L., Combined GPS L1C/A and L2C signal acquisition architecture leveraging differential combination (2014) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 50 (4), pp. 3212-3229; Qaisar, S.U., Khalaf-Allah, M., A new adaptive code processing scheme for high-sensitivity acquisition in dual-frequency GPS L1-L2C receivers (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 International Technical Meeting of the Institute of Navigation, pp. 536-541. , San Diego, California, January; Hsuan, C.Y., Sherman, L., Enge, P., Akos, D., Combining L1 signals for improved sensitivity (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 International Technical Meeting of the Institute of Navigation, pp. 164-172. , Dana Point, California, January; Megahed, D., O'Driscoll, C., Lachapelle, G., Performance evaluation of combined L1/L5 Kalman filter-based tracking versus standalone L1/L5 tracking in challenging environments (2009) Proceedings of ION GNSS 22nd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division, pp. 2591-2601. , Savannah GA; Dovis, F., Ta, T.H., (2012) High Sensitivity Techniques for GNSS Signal acquisition, , Technical Report, InTech; Qaisar, S.U., Dempster, A.G., Assessment of the GPS L2C code structure for efficient signal acquisition (2012) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 48 (3), pp. 1889-1902; Namuru GPS Receiver V2, , http://www.dynamics.co.nz/index.php?main_page=page&id=11; Bastide, F., Julien, O., Macabiauy, C., Roturiert, B., Analysis of L5/E5 acquisition, tracking and data demodulation thresholds (2005) Proceedings of ION GPS 2002, pp. 2196-2207. , Portland OR",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 Military Communications and Information Systems Conference, MilCIS 2016","8 November 2016 through 10 November 2016",,125694,,9781509019755,,,"English","Mil.

The purpose of extended prediction is the reduction of the time-to-first-fix of a stand-alone satellite navigation receiver and the improvement of the availability of positioning during weak signal conditions. We describe the models we used to predict satellite orbit and clock and present the prediction accuracies we obtained with our models. With a constant-parameter solar radiation pressure (SRP) model, we obtained orbit prediction accuracies of 8, 25, and 80m for prediction lengths of 3, 7, and 14 days, respectively. With an SRP model with seasonally varying parameters the accuracies for prediction lengths of 3, 7, and 14 days are 7, 14, and 34 m, respectively. When predicting the QZSS clock for 7 days, the 68% and 95% quantiles of the accumulated prediction errors were 9 and 24m when using parameters with age of 7 days, 13 and 33m with age of 14 days, and 22 and 62m with age of 28 days. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Clocks; Forecasting; Global positioning system; Satellites; Signal receivers; Tracking (position); Constant parameters; Orbit prediction; Prediction accuracy; Prediction errors; Satellite navigation receiver; Solar radiation pressure models; Time to first fixes; Varying parameters; Orbits",,,,,"Quasi-Zenith Satellite-1, MICHIBIKI, , http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/qzss/index.html, [Online]; Misra, P., Enge, P., (2006) Global Positioning System: Signals, Measurements, and Performance, , 2nd ed.

In this method, weak signal detection is performed to reduce the noise accompanied with the signal. Seven orders of Chebyshev (I) filter and the anti-jamming technology are used in the PCB layout, and grounding modes are introduced to reduce the noise of the amplitude waveform. The proposed method reduce the final output noise by 2/3 and the signal-to-noise ratio is increased to 24 dB. The experimental results show that the magnetic signal of RMB banknotes are acquired by the circuit stability, which provides an important guarantee for the improvements of the anti-counterfeit and discrimination for banknotes performance. © 2016, Wuhan University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","electromagnetic interference; magnetic signal; seven orders of Chebyshev; weak signal detection",,,,,,"Tang, C.H., Techniques of discriminating machine for RMB banknotes [J] (2005) Instrumentation Technology, 4, pp. 80-81; Zhou, L.G., Liang, T., Gao, L.C., Weak signal detecting and processing of pyroelectric infrared sensor [J] (2014) Instrument Technique and Sensor, 12, pp. 5-6; Zou, R., Chen, X.G., Bian, J.D., Design of bill acceptor oriented to metro automatic fare collection application [J] (2015) Computer Engineering, 41 (6), pp. 6-11; Xue, L.Y., Li, X., Algorithm of serial number extraction and recognition based on tunnel magneto resistance sensor [J] (2015) Journal of Hangzhou Dianzi University (Natural Sciences), 3, pp. 73-76; Rong, Y., Exploration on a step further localization of urban mass transit AFC system [J] (2013) Urban Mass Transit, 9, pp. 14-17; Lu, Y.Q., Shi, Z.Q., Hu, Y.X., The analysis of signal characteristics in counterfeit identification system based on multi-sensor [J] (2015) Journal of Hebei University of Technology, 2, pp. 43-49; Gao, J.Z., (2011) Detection of Weak Signals [M, , Tsinghua University Press, Beijing; Li, M., (2014) The Design and Implementation of Data Acquisition and Control System in Note Validator, , South China University of Technology, Guangzhou; Vishnevskii, V.G., Berzhansky, V.N., Nedviga, A.S., Visualizer of magnetic protection of securities and banknotes [J] (2009) Sensor Letters, 7, pp. 282-285; Hu, H.B., Zhong, H., Chen, C.L., Magnetically responsive photonic watermarks on banknotes [J] (2014) Journal of Materials Chemistry C, 2, pp. 3695-3702. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXmsFWksLw%3D; Christopher, F., Antao, C., Induction detection of concealed bulk banknotes [J] (2011) Measurement Science & Technology, 8357, p. 83570; (2014) Shenyang University of Technology, , Jiang N.

However, traditional CD techniques are computationally intense due to the large clock bias search space. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a new scheme of CD with less computational burden, in order to accelerate the detection and location process. Design/methodology/approach – This paper proposes a new scheme of CD. It reformulates the problem of GNSS signal detection as an optimization problem, and solves it with the aid of an improved Pigeon-Inspired Optimization (PIO). With the improved PIO algorithm adopted, the positioning algorithm arrives to evaluate only a part of the points in the search space, avoiding the problems of grid-search method which is universally adopted. Findings – Faced with the complex optimization problem, the improved PIO algorithm proves to have good performance. In the acquisition of simulated and real signals, the proposed scheme of CD with the improved PIO algorithm also have better efficiency, precision and stability than traditional CD algorithm. Besides, the improved PIO algorithm also proves to be a better candidate to be integrated into the proposed scheme than particle swarm optimization, differential evolution and PIO. Originality/value – The novelty associated with this paper is the proposition of the new scheme of CD and the improvement of PIO algorithm. Thus, this paper introduces another possibility to ameliorate the traditional CD. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Collective detection; GNSS; GNSS signal acquisition; Pigeon-inspired optimization;

Technology trends such as additive manufacturing (""3D printing"") and the Internet of Things with its applications such as Industrie 4.0 in production technology are seen by companies as both major opportunities and threats to their business models on an abstract level, yet the identification and especially evaluation of specific technologies impacting a company's business in the future is still difficult. Disruptive technologies threaten market incumbents as these technologies enable addressing new or latent customer requirements or evaluation dimensions in a given market rather than improving on the fulfillment of existing evaluation criteria. When the value customers place on requirements and evaluation criteria (i.e. The evaluation context) changes, this can lead to rapid devaluation of products or services using traditional technologies. Technology Scanning is the technology intelligence sub-discipline responsible for finding weak signals of technological trends, and as we conjecture also for finding signals on technology-driven impeding changes in evaluation contexts in relevant markets. To do so, Technology Scanning uses a toolbox of methods including forecasting, scenario analysis, and trend analysis methods. We have previously stated the need for practitioners to have a framework of design recommendations for technology scanning based on the specific company's strategic goals on the identification of disruptive technologies, and outlined a research agenda on providing such a framework. As part of this research agenda, in this paper we present an overview of requirements for identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies in a company's context, and give an analysis of existing methods and design options (processes, organizations etc.) for technology scanning regarding these requirements. We proceed to outline a method to systematically detect possible changes in evaluation contexts to assist identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies using cross-industry analogies. We find that concepts from technology intelligence need to be complemented with concepts from market intelligence and environmental scanning to properly evaluate upcoming disruptive changes.","Disruptive Technologies; Technology Intelligence; Technology Scanning","3D printers; Commerce; Industrial management; Scanning; Three dimensional computer graphics; Customer requirements; Design recommendations; Disruptive technology; Environmental scanning; Production technology; Technological trends; Technology intelligence; Technology scanning; Environmental technology",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E.J., (1990) Implanting Strategic Management, , 2nd ed.

We create a hippocampal surface atlas with subfield information, model each hippocampus using the SPHARM technique, and register it to the atlas to extract surface deformation signals. We propose a new alternative to standard random field theory (RFT) and permutation image analysis methods, Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) Distribution Analysis or SPM-DA, to perform statistical shape analysis and compare its performance with that of RFT methods on both simulated and real hippocampal surface data. The major strengths of our framework are twofold: (a) SPM-DA provides potentially more powerful algorithms than standard RFT methods for detecting weak signals, and (b) the framework embraces the important hippocampal subfield information for improved biological interpretation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via an application to an AD cohort, where an SPM-DA method detects meaningful hippocampal shape differences in EMCI that are undetected by standard RFT methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Augmented reality; Bioinformatics; Brain; Image analysis; Medical imaging; Signal processing; Biological interpretation; Distribution analysis; Image analysis method; Mild cognitive impairments; Statistical image analysis; Statistical parametric mapping; Statistical shape analysis; Surface deformation; Statistical methods",,,,,"Chung, M.K., Robbins, S., Cortical thickness analysis in autism via heat kernel smoothing (2005) Neuroimage, 25, pp. 1256-1265; Cong, S., Rizkalla, M., Surface-based morphometric analysis of hippocampal subfields in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (2015) IEEE 58Th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, MWSCAS 2015, pp. 813-816; Patenaude, B., Smith, S.M., A Bayesian model of shape and appearance for subcortical brain segmentation (2011) Neuroimage, 56 (3), pp. 907-922; Pluta, J., Yushkevich, P., In vivo analysis of hippocampal subfield atrophy in mild cognitive impairment via semi-automatic segmentation of T2-weighted MRI (2012) J.

An important aspect within the innovation process, is technology planning. The Heinz Nixdorf Institute developed a technology planning concept, which is supported by an Innovation-Database. The Innovation-Database synchronizes aspects from the market pull and the technology push. Furthermore, it is used as a knowledge management system for innovations and technologies. The challenge is filling the technology pool with a minimum set of technologies in order to use the whole functionality of the Innovation-Database. Many resources are needed in order to fill the technology pool or to update it. There is in increase in information in the World Wide Web and most of the information is fuzzy. Our approach is to identify them automatically by using crawler technologies. Therefore a software tool was developed, which automatically crawls for technologies in the database of the European Patent Office and in the journal database IEEE Xplore. In these data sources, the tool identifies technologies automatically in natural texts, prepares the data and visualize them. It is not suitable to scan a text for a defined set of technologies in a dictionary, because then the tool is not able to find new technologies or to detect weak signals. In this paper, the architecture and features of the software tool is described. It uses text mining methods to detect technologies in unstructured, fuzzy data. As input data, the user has to provide a search field, which the search is performed for. Furthermore, the data sources have to be defined. The tool crawls these data sources in order to identify technologies, which can be relevant for a given search field. The tool suggests newly identified technologies for the search field, which are generally relevant. The user has to decide whether those technologies are important for him. This information is used as feedback for the text-mining model to improve the precision of future analyses. In order to support the user, a suggested technology is automatically provided with further information, like a description and an estimation of technological maturity. With this information a user can start an evaluation of the technology. For every technology a datasheet is created with detail information. It can easily be customized for specific demands. All technologies can be visualized on a radar. The radar shows all technologies for a search field according to its relevance. These information is used for strategic product and technology planning.

To overcome this fading effect, several schemes, such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBC), different combining schemes at the relay and receiving end, and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are used in both the transmitting and the relay links. In this paper, we first make compare the performance of a two-hop wireless link under a different combination of space diversity in the first and second hop of the amplify-and-forward (AF) case. Our second task in this paper is to incorporate the weak signal of a direct link and then by applying the channel model of two random variables (one for a direct link and another for a relayed link) we get very impressive result at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that is comparable with other models at a higher SNR. Our third task is to bring other three schemes under a two-hop wireless link: use of transmit antenna selection (TAS) on both link with weak direct link, distributed Alamouti scheme in two-hop link and single relay antenna with OFDM subcarrier. Finally, all of the schemes mentioned above are compared to select the best possible model. The main finding of the paper is as follows: the use of MIMO on both hops but application TAS on both links with weak direct link and the full rate OFDM with the sub-carrier for an individual link provide a better result as compared to other models. © 2015 KIPS.","Ergodic capacity;

Then, a low-noise, high-resolution oil borehole-surface potential gradient detection system is designed and developed based on virtual instrument technology. The system applies a differential input. The short circuit noise amplitude is lower than -130 dB. The A/D acquisition, which adopts the expansion slot design ideas, realizes the synchronization of multi-channel data acquisition. The upper layer software consists of Matlab and Labview programming techniques, thus the extraction of weak signals and real-time imaging of detection results can be achieved. Experiments show that the potential gradient detection system has higher resolution and good stability compared to the potential detection system. By processing and analyzing the experimental data obtained from the injection wells in Daqing oilfield, it can locate the cutting-edge of water drive. Furthermore, the injection well data prove the accuracy and effectiveness of the system in detecting the water injection direction. ©, 2014, Jilin Daxue Xuebao (Gongxueban)/Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition).

The values and cultural norms embodied in television programming have potentially profound implications for influencing behaviour, including reproductive decisions. After replicating Westoff and Koffman’s (2011) finding of a positive correlation between television ownership and contraception using pooled Indonesian data, we proceed to estimate a fixed-effects model. The coefficient on television loses its significance while other policy relevant variables retain theirs. We conclude that the growing corpus of cross-sectional evidence on a link between television and contraception should be interpreted cautiously. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,"contraceptive use; cultural relations; developing world; television; Indonesia",,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Disease and development: The effect of life expectancy on economic growth (2007) Journal of Political Economy, 115, pp. 925-985; Nielsen Media, A.G.B., Research, (2007) It’s prime time!

In this paper, we apply the schema to bear communication research. The main idea of our research is to identify groups of voice sequences which are typical for certain situations such as waking up from hibernation, cubs coming out for the first time from the den, a female bear teaching her cubs, cubs playing, mating and defense of territory. The communication schema of a brown bear seems to be very goal-oriented and situation specific. Once we can identify context-dependent communication schemas, we will be able to better interpret bear vocalization. The bear communication ABC can be used by scientists, authorities, teachers, students, hikers and especially citizens living in bear-rich areas. For environmental conservation initiatives and programs, it is also important to interpret, early enough, weak signals coming from the bears' natural environments. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.","bear communication; bear research; Context-based communication; sensing-processing-actuating architecture",,,,,,"Pentikäinen, J., (2005) On Bear's Heels, , Helsinki University Press, Helsinki; Bieder, R.E., (2005) Bear, , Reaktion Books Ltd, London, UK; Hailer, F., Nuclear genomic sequences reveal that polar bears are on old and distinct bear lineage (2012) Science, 336, pp. 344-347; Wartiainen, P., Kärkkäinen, T., Heimbürger, A., Äyrämö, S., Context-sensitive approach to dynamic visual analytics of energy production process (2012) Proceedings of the 22nd European-Japanese Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, pp. 25-32. , In: Kiyoki, Y. and Tokuda, T.

However, the mixing vector of SCBSS, which is the base of the EMD method, has not yet been effectively constructed. The mixing vector reflects the weights of original signal sources that form the single channel blind signal source. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a mixing vector for a single channel blind signal source to approximate the actual mixing vector in terms of keeping the same ratios between signal weights. The constructed mixing vector can be used to improve signal separations. Our method incorporates the adaptive filter, least square method, EMD method and signal source samples to construct the mixing vector. Experimental tests using audio signal evaluations were conducted and the results indicated that our method can improve the similar values of sources energy ratio from 0.2644 to 0.8366. This kind of recognition is very important in weak signal detection. © 2014 IEEE.","Adaptive filter; Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Mixing vector; Single channel blind source separation (SCBSS)","Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Least squares approximations; Mixing; Signal analysis; Signal processing; Vectors; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Experimental test; Least square methods; Original signal; Signal separation; Single channel blind source separations; Vector construction; Weak signal detection; Blind source separation",,,,,"Huang, N.E., Shen, Z., Long, S.R., Wu, M.C., Shih, E.H., Zheng, Q., Yen, N.-C., Liu, H.H., The empirical mode decomposition method and the Hilbert spectrum for non-stationary time series analysis (1998) Proc.

Personal physical activity protects against weight gain and obesity. Personal physical inactivity has been linked to a number of common and increasing prevalent health problems such as cardiovascular disease and a number of chronic diseases such as cancer (colon and breast), diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and depression. Accelerometers can be used to objectively measure a person?s incidental, intermittent physical activity such as short walks. They also enable movement to be monitored inside buildings that is often not recorded and is difficult using other technologies such as Global Position Systems (GPS). Accelerometers allow comprehensive analysis of physical activity bouts. They also have low subject burden, not having to rely on the memory of individuals and are unobtrusive, and allow recording over multiple days. However, accelerometers do not accurately record physical activity associated with cycling. GPS can be used to estimate personal energy expenditure from cycling since the speed and duration of movement is logged. However, GPS does not provide data at some locations such as inside buildings, urban canyons, or tunnels due to weak signals from satellites. Transport is a major activity type and common form of personal physical activity. This paper describes procedures for integrating GPS and accelerometers to estimate personal physical activity arising from transport.

A modified Viterbi algorithm (MVA) based on dynamic programming is developed and it is applied to GPS bit synchronization to improve bit edge position detection probability. Meanwhile, two combination carrier tracking schemes based on central difference Kalman filter (CDKF) and MVA module are designed for tracking very weak GPS signal. The testing results indicate that the methods can successfully detect bit edge position with high detection probability whether or not the tracking loop is locked.

However, GNSS is vulnerable to signal interference. Deliberate and accidental jamming can render the whole system unusable at a particular time or location, while faults affecting individual signals can also arise. Under such conditions, GNSS equipment, including systems on ships' bridges and GNSS-enabled Aids-to-Navigation (AtoN), can produce erroneous position solutions, which are then fed to safety-related systems such as electronic charts/displays and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). In January 2012, the GNSS Research and Applications Centre (GRACE) at the University of Nottingham was tasked by the General lighthouse Authorities to investigate current trends in 'hardening' GNSS technology against signal interference, to support GLA policy development and research prioritisation in the context of e-Navigation which is expected to be established in the 2015 - 2022 timeframe. GNSS receivers are vulnerable to interference, due to the low received signal powers. It has been shown that unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI) is ubiquitous. In close proximity to the GNSS frequency bands, there are active services for satellite communications, TV broadcasting, radar and UWB applications. These services can cause out-of-band emissions, harmonics or inter-modulation products. The weak signal environment, presence of intentional and unintentional interference and the use of GNSS in critical applications make an impact assessment of RFI essential. Receiver manufacturers are slowly responding and improving their jamming detection and mitigation capabilities. Mid-range receivers are available that implement narrow-band RF filters, adaptive A/D, FFT (notch) filter and multipath mitigation. Adaptive antenna-arrays with spatial filtering, providing from 25 to 40dB of anti-jamming protection, are available on high-end receivers. Receivers integrated with INS solutions have prices varying according to the grade of the inertial measurement unit employed. RAIM is provided for many high-end receivers, in particular for aviation applications. There are measures that can be taken by radio regulatory bodies, navigation service providers and geodetic organisations to detect, locate and mitigate interference. The approach has generally been reactive, networks of detection probes have only been set up on a trial basis. However, there is much infrastructure already in place that can be used for this purpose and this paper looks at the requirements and possible design approaches, particularly in the maritime context.",,"Adaptive antenna arrays; Automation; Frequency bands; Interference suppression; Jamming; Navigation; Satellite communication systems; Signal detection; Signal interference; Television broadcasting; Units of measurement; Automatic identification system; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Inertial measurement unit; Inter-modulation products; Radio frequency interference; Research and application; Satellite communications; University of Nottingham; Global positioning system",,,,,"Vulnerabilities of GNSS services (Part Two) - Information from the Royal Academy of Engineering (2011) PositionIT Magazine, pp. 54-60. , October; (2004) Recommendation R-129 on GNSS Vulnerability and Mitigation Measures, , December [Revised December 2008] IALA, Edition 2, December; Landry Jr., R., Renard, A., Analysis of Potential Interference Sources and Assessment of Present Solutions for GPS/GNSS Receivers 4th Saint-Petersburg on INS, Saint-Petersburg, 1997, , presented at; Scott, L., J911: Fast jammer detection and location using cell-phone crowd-sourcing (2010) GPS World, , Nov; Vincent, W.R., Adler, R.W., McGill, P., Clynch, J.R., Badger, G., Parker, A.A., The hunt for RFI - Unjamming a coast harbor (2003) GPS World, p. 1; Interference to GPS Receivers from Consumer Electronics - Grade Active VHF/UHF Marine Television Antennas, , Local Notices to Mariners, District 1, 05:2; Curry, C., Vehicle Borne GPS Jamming Incidents Detected in the SENTINEL Project (2012) Seminar on GNSS Vulnerability: Present Dangers, Future Threats 2012, , NPL Teddington, 21st February; http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/osnetfreeservices/ furtherinfo/accuracy.html; Grant, A., Williams, P., Ward, N., The Potential effects of GPS Jamming on Marine Navigation Royal Institute of Navigation, NAV 10 Conference, London, November 2010; Ward, N., Johannessen, R., Overcoming Interference to GPS in the Marine Environment (1994) GLA Internal Report, , 3 October",,,"","Institute of Navigation","Institute of Navigation International Technical Meeting 2014, ITM 2014","27 January 2014 through 29 January 2014","San Diego, CA",106136,,9781632660800,,,"English","Inst.

GPS satellites network provides precise location information of all places globally, is widely used for asset tracking by corporates.

Travelling from a Strong Signal Area (SSA) to a Weak Signal Area (WSA) causes a significant drop in the mobile network bandwidth available to the device. This causes Quality of Service (QoS) problems for video streams over mobile networks. For a completely pause-less video stream, the average stream download rate must be consistently equal to, or greater than, the video bit-rate. A sudden bandwidth drop often causes the stream to rapidly become starved of buffered data, causing a pause in playback whilst the client attempts further buffering - posing a QoS problem. This paper proposes a solution that helps counter this mobility problem by attempting to foresee a user entering a WSA, and dynamically rate-limiting other nearby best-case users to increase available bandwidth to said user. Predictions are based on active user location information, and Mobile Network Coverage Map (MNCM) queries. Best-case user determination and dynamic rate-limit algorithms are described in this paper. Through mathematical proofing with two unique test scenarios, the proposed solution is proven to significantly improve QoS of a video stream to a user entering a WSA. © 2013 The Science and Information Organization.","mobile; QoS; quality; rate-limit; service; stream; video","mobile; rate-limit; service; stream; video; Bandwidth; Drops; Image quality; Video streaming; Quality of service",,,,,"(2011) Statistics, , http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics, Retrieved December 1, 2012, from; Newcomb, D., (2012) Which 2012 Cars Have the Best Tech?The Technology in These Vehicles Makes Life Easier and More Entertaining on the Road-not More Complicated., MSN Autos, , http://editorial.autos.msn.com/which-2012-cars-havethe-best-tech, Retrieved January 19, 2012, from; (2004) Vodafone Begins 3G Mobile Service, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3996971.stm, Retrieved December 1, 2012, from; (2012) 4GEE, , http://explore.ee.co.uk/4gee, Retrieved December 1, 2012, from; Quality of Service (QoS) Concept and Architecture, , 3GPP TS 23.107; (2012) Crowd-sourced Cellular Coverage Maps for the World, , http://opensignal.com, Retrieved December 2, 2012, from; Riiser, H., Vigmostad, P., Griwodz, C., Halvorsen, P., Bitrate and video quality planning for mobile streaming scenarios using a GPS-based bandwidth lookup service (2011) Proc. of ICME, , july; Curcio, V.V., Hannuksela, M., Geo-predictive real-time media delivery in mobile environment (2010) Proc. of Mobile Video Delivery, , soct; Ozer, J., (2009) H.264 Scalable Video Coding-what You Need to Know, , http://www.streaminglearningcenter.com/articles/h264-scalable- videocoding-what-you-need-to-know.html, Retrieved December 1, 2012, from; Tappayuthpijarn, K., Stockhammer, T., Steinbach, E., HTTP-based scalable video streaming over mobile networks (2011) Image Processing (ICIP), 2011 18th IEEE International Conference on, p. 2193. , 2196, 11-14 Sept; Singh, V., Ott, J., Curcio, I.D.D., Predictive buffering for streaming video in 3G networks (2012) World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM), 2012 IEEE International Symposium on a, p. 1. , 25-28 June, 10","University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, United Kingdom",,"The Science and Information (SAI) Organization;Springer",,"2013 Science and Information Conference, SAI 2013","7 October 2013 through 9 October 2013","London",101986,,9780989319300,,,"English","Proc.

Analysing safety related records and learning from 'touch and go' situations is one possible way of preventing hazardous conditions from occurring in both aviation and healthcare. The eventuality of an incident or an accident may markedly be reduced if the risks connected to it are efficiently diagnosed. With the aid of this outlook, flight safety has witnessed decades of successful improvement. Since aviation and healthcare share similarities, the methods for improving safety could be transferable between the domains. This paper explores how a data mining technique used in aviation to identify the weak signals of lethal trends can be applied to healthcare documentation.","Aviation; Aviation safety; Clustering; Hazardous event; Healthcare; Lethal trend; Patient safety; Risk management; Text mining; Weak signal","Aviation safety; Clustering; Hazardous events; Lethal trend; Patient safety; Text mining; Weak signals; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Health care; Risk management; Aviation",,,,,"Amalberti, R., Auroy, Y., Berwick, D., Barach, P., Five system barriers to achieving ultrasafe health care (2005) Annals of Internal Medicine, 142 (9), pp. 756-764; Ananyan, S., Goodfellow, M., (2004) New Capabilities of PolyAnalyst Text and Data Mining Applied to STEADES Data at the International Air Transport Association (IATA): A Technology Demonstration, , Global Aviation Information Network; Boaden, R., The contribution of quality management to patient safety (2006) Patient Safety: Research Into Practice, , K.

The purpose of the paper is to study the design aspects of customer managed intermodal transport system development to see what makes such systems competitive. Focus is on why shippers develop such solutions; how they solve fundamental performance problems; and what characterises such shippers. Shippers engage in development and management of intermodal solutions based on perceived weak signals about future threats and opportunities. Intermodal solutions are designed to meet cost, quality, and environmental requirements. Shippers engaging in development of such solutions have large and concentrated flows. Furthermore, they have strong environmental policies, and are highly dependent on efficient transport. Finally, they are major buyers in the transport market having previous experience in using rail/intermodal.

Key insights and messages are often picked up from one expert group to the next and from one policy domain to another, creating significant spin-off effects. Example of influential approaches include the rupture/disruption theme (picked up by the first SCAR foresight group and elaborated in other European exercises), and the grand challenge approach (flagged by the ERA Rationales group and taken up in the design of Horizon 2020). Transformation by design using policy shocks is being increasingly implemented at European and national level through the use of horizon scanning and detection of wild cards and weak signals of major disruptions underway or on the horizon. FP7 Blue Skies projects focused on refining the tools for identifying wilds cards and weak signals, and on reflecting on their significance in relation to addressing European grand societal challenges. These projects highlighted the need for an ongoing facility at European level to map and detect signals and to understand and analyse the interactions and impacts of such trends and drivers in the European and global context. The establishment of a centralised foresight and scanning facility with the Joint Research Centre central offices in Brussels, and of the European Forum on Forward-looking Activities, can be seen as significant steps that build on the earlier Foresight studies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Konnola, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., Van Rij, V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: Lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Sci Public Policy, 39 (2), pp. 208-221; Cassingena Harper, J., (2002) The Relevance of EU Regional Foresight Experiences for Small Candidate Countries, , Paper prepared for EU HLG on Regional Foresight, April 2002; Cassingena Harper, J., Georghiou, L., The targeted and unforeseen impacts of foresight on innovation policy: The eFORESEE Malta case study (2005) Int J Foresight Innov Policy, 2 (1), pp. 84-103; Cunningham, P., Karakasidou, A., Innovation and societal challenges (2010) Pro Inno Europe Thematic Report No, p. 1; Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: Insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) TASM, 20 (3), pp. 369-387; (2008) Challenging Europe’s Research -Rationales for the European Research Area (ERA, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/pdf/eg7-era-rationales-final-report_en.pdf, report of the ERA Expert Group, EUR 23326 EN.

Specifically, a technique called Staggered Coherent Integration is proposed which enables up to 1 dB improvement in sensitivity compared to conventional techniques. Also discussed are challenges in tracking the weak signals seen in indoor conditions and techniques to improve sustained tracking under these conditions. Analysis and simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques described. © 2013 IEEE.","Acquisition; Detection; GNSS; Tracking sensitivity","Error detection; Signal analysis; Acquisition; Analysis and simulation; Coherent integration; Conventional techniques; GNSS; Indoor conditions; Tracking sensitivity; User experience; Global positioning system",,,,,"Kaplan, E.D., Understanding GPS: Principles and Applications, , Artech House; Abdi, A., On the estimation of the K parameter for the rice fading distribution (2001) IEEE Commun.

Moreover, by integrating the HTS filter and semiconductor pre-amplifier together with a cryo-cooler, the noise figure of the system can be further reduced. In the past ten years, various kinds of HTS filters have been designed and successfully applied in many fields. Aiming to satellite applications, an experimental HTS microwave receiver front end had been constructed and passed all the space qualification tests. The first Chinese space HTS subsystem was taken into space with a civilian experimental satellite for new technology (Shi Jian - 9) on October 14, 2012. Data received from this satellite show that the HTS filter is working on orbit perfectly. A space science research system with ultra-wide band HTS filter is also under development as a payload of Chinese first space laboratory (Tian Gong - 2). Applications of HTS filters on the ground are also attractive. A demonstration HTS meteorological radar station was set up in Beijing and it showed great improvements in sensitivity and anti-interference ability in urban area wind profile measurements. HTS system was constructed for applications with high power handling requirements, e.g., TD-SCDMA system mobile base station. The HTS system showed very good results in reducing bit error rate for weak signals, strong enhancement in anti-interference and excellent compatibility in restricting spurious power of emitting signals. Improvements in video communications are also remarkable. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Electromagnets; Magnetic devices; Meteorological radar; Microwave filters; Passive filters; Satellites; Space stations; Superconductivity; High power handlings; Microwave passive devices; Mobile base station; Out of band rejection; Satellite applications; Space qualification; Video communications; Wind profile measurements; High temperature superconductors",,,,,,,,"IEEE (Beijing Section)","IEEE Computer Society","2013 IEEE International Conference on Applied Superconductivity and Electromagnetic Devices, ASEMD 2013","25 October 2013 through 27 October 2013","Beijing",104640,,,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Therefore hybrid positioning methods have been developed integrating other signals and sensors including pseudolites, ultra-wideband, cell ID and WLAN fingerprinting with GPS to aid navigation in indoor environments. Service providers using such hybrid solutions claim location accuracies on the order of 10 meters in open sky and 50 meters indoors. This paper presents test results obtained by integrating software based 2.4 GHz WLAN Time-of-Arrival measurements with GPS. Reference trajectories were obtained using conventional surveying, where the kinematic trajectory was formed by moving between pre-surveyed points. Tests were conducted in a high multipath indoor environment with limited satellite availability but with ranging from multiple WLAN access points to the mobile user. Results show that ranges from several overlapping WLAN nodes combined with GPS pseudorange measurements can provide five meter or better position accuracy in these kinds of indoor environments.",,"Broadband networks; Hybrid systems; Navigation; Satellites; Software testing; Surveys; Hybrid positioning; In-door navigations; Indoor environment; Kinematic trajectories; Pseudorange measurements; Reference trajectories; Satellite availability; Time-of-arrival measurements; Global positioning system",,,,,"Brown, R., Hwang, P.Y.C., (2013) Introduction to Random Signals and Applied Kalman Filtering: With MATLAB Exercises and Solutions, , 4th edition.

However BI constructed by integrating data from multiple sources remain restricted to strong economic signals as its systems cannot cope with the amount and diversity of data about sustainability. BI's non-engagement with weak signals about the impact of unsustainable activities is aggravated by the absence of a single uncontested definition of sustainability. Ecosystem literature advocates grappling with sustainability's characteristic uncertainty-complexity by providing stakeholders with information that fosters capacities for social learning. Here we put forward socially constructed risk-based analytical-deliberative platform that integrates weak environmental signals, thus better representing the uncertainty and complexity aspects of sustainability. An Australian case-study of irrigators is used to examine how our platform integrates weak environmental signals with BI's strong signals, and fosters capacities for social learning among decision-makers. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Business intelligence; Information management; Integrated risk; Social learning; Sustainability; Systems",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E., (1990) Implanting Strategic Management, , 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, NY; Beal, R.M., Competing effectively: Environmental scanning, competitive strategy, and organisational performance in small manufacturing firms (2000) Journal of Small Business Management, 38 (1), pp. 27-47; Beck, U., Risk society (1993) Towards A New Modernity, , Trans.

In doing so the paper looks at new generations of ideas; new generations of individualism; and new generations of organisational structures and cultures. Weak signals can already be identified from a century ago indicating new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, psychology and education. These signs of what many regard as evolutionary change in human thinking run parallel with many of the exponential changes manifesting in the external world. The paper argues for a shift beyond egotistic individualism to collective individualism, laying foundations for major organisational transformation to meet the needs of uncertain futures. The paper suggests that futures studies as a field needs to be sensitive to the developmental and paradigmatic changes that have been occurring both within and across the knowledge spectrum. Finally, the World Futures Studies Federation is examined as a case study to determine whether it is, indeed, ahead of its times. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"culture; education; future prospect; individualism; philosophy; psychology; twenty first century",,,,,"Berger, G., (1964) Phénoménologie du temps et prospective, , Presses Universitaires de France, Paris; Adam, B., Groves, C., (2007) Future Matters: Action, Knowledge, Ethics, Supplements to the Study of Time, , Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands; Inayatullah, S., Gidley, J., (2000) The University in Transformation: Global Perspectives on the Futures of the University, , Bergin and Garvey, Westport, CT; Boulding, E., Image and action in peace building (1988) Journal of Social Issues, 44 (2), p. 17; Masini, E., The future of futures studies (1989) Futures, (APRIL), p. 152; Inayatullah, S., Wildman, P., (1998) Futures Studies: Methods, Emerging Issues and Civilizational Visions.

This paper presents the application of blind signal processing technology to the extraction of seismic weak signals. Based on the investigation and analysis of the relationship between blind signal processing theory and seismic reflection features of subtle traps, an aliasing model of seismic blind-source signals is established in order to extract weak signals from seismic data of target reservoirs. At same time, two new strategies for weak signal extraction are proposed. Using reflection similarity among seismic traces of surrounding rocks and reflection differences of weak signals from target reservoirs, we developed an iterative algorithm for weak signals extraction. The results of simulation and seismic data processing show that the method can extract seismic weak signals successfully and thus improves the resolution of seismic data. © 2012 IEEE.","Blind Signal Processing; Blind Source Separation; Seismic Weak Signal; Subtle Pool","Blind signal processing; Investigation and analysis; Modern signal processing; Seismic data processing; Seismic reflection feature; Subtle Pool; Transmission channels; Weak signals; Algorithms; Blind source separation; Data processing; Extraction; Seismic response; Signal filtering and prediction; Seismic waves",,,,,"Halbouty, M.T., The deliberate search for the subtle trap (1982) AAPG Memoir, 32 (3), p. 351; Li, X.Q., Cui, L.J., Chen, S.P., Exploration of subtle pool-past and future (2005) Petroleum Geology and Recovery Efficiency, 12 (1), pp. 30-32; Liang, Y.C., Leyman, A.R., Soong, B.H., Blind source separation using second-order cyclic-statistics (1997) IEEE Conferences on Signal Processing, pp. 57-60; Liu, X.W., Liu, H., Zheng, T.Y., Separation of converted-wave from seismic multiples by independent component analysis (2003) Journal of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Engineering, 23 (1), pp. 11-19; Ma, J.C., Niu, Y.L., Chen, H.Y., (2006) Blind Signal Processing, , National Defence Industry Press; Wang, Y.S., Zhao, L.Q., Prospect evaluation approach and application in exploration stage of subtle reservoir (2010) Petroleum Geology and Recovery Efficiency, 17 (3), pp. 1-5; Yin, X.-Y., Liu, J., Yang, P.-J., Negative entropy-based Bussgang seismic blind de-convolution (2007) Shiyou Diqiu Wuli Kantan/Oil Geophysical Prospecting, 42 (5), pp. 499-505; Zhang, J.H., Wang, J., Liang, X.T., Liu, Z., Shan, L.Y., Shi, L.G., Weak signal characteristics and its identification in high-density signal sensor data (2011) Acta Seismologica Sinica, 33 (6), pp. 788-799; Zhang, L.H., Qiu, T.S., Li, J.C., Tan, H.F., A blind source separation method based on the fourth-order cyclic cumulant (2011) Signal Processing, 27 (9), pp. 1412-1415; Wang, F.S., Zhang, L.R., Independent subspace analysis for blind signal separation using natural algorithm (2011) Journal of Nanjing University (Natural Science), 47 (4), pp. 420-425","Mu, X.; Geoscience Research Institute of Shengli Oilfield, SINOPEC, Dongying City, China; email: muxing.slyt@sinopec.com",,"IEEE Beijing Section;The Chinese Institute of Electronics (CIE);The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET);Union Radio Scientifique Internationale (URSI);National Natural Science Foundation of China",,"2012 11th International Conference on Signal Processing, ICSP 2012","21 October 2012 through 25 October 2012","Beijing",96617,,9781467321945,,,"English","Int Conf Signal Process Proc",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876470625

Given a low revenue expectation and the elusive nature of predicting weak-signal click-through rates, the computational cost incurred by bid estimation shall be cautiously justified. We developed and deployed a novel impression valuation model, which is expected to reduce the computational cost by 95% and hence more than double the profit.

Many organizations fail to supply explanations for key events, or provide explanations that are so vague that they lack real information. As a result, trust can be easily damaged or destroyed through organizational failures and from the inability to repair it. Key Questions and Approach How should organizations repair trust among external stakeholders? In what situations are communications to the public and institutional reforms likely to rebuild public trust following a competence violation or an integrity violation? How can companies rebuild trust when direct observation and interaction with the public cannot readily occur? New Knowledge Institutional reforms can be used to prevent distrust and to signal an organization’s commitment to integrity or competence, and, as such, can effectively rebuild trust. Controllability conditions the choice of trust repair strategies. Controllability assigns “blame” or “fault” to the organization, such as how much to hold another accountable for the failure, even if the organizational actions or inactions are deemed to be the root cause of the failure. Public communication (such as apologies, accounts, and plans) are best conceptualized as a weak signal, but when bundled with more credible signals (such as institutional reforms), communication results in higher levels of public trust than communication or costly actions alone. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,"Anheier, H.K., (1999) When Things Go Wrong: Organizational Failures and Breakdowns, , (ed.)

We can locate Wi-Fi-enabled devices by applying location-sensing techniques. However, the positioning accuracy depends greatly on the Wi-Fi signal coverage. The positioning accuracy due to poor Wi-Fi signal coverage has not been investigated systematically in the current research on Wi-Fi location awareness. Our previous work provide a location threshold of 1.82m on average. However, when a person enters in a poor Wi-Fi coverage region, the positioning accuracy drops dramatically. In this paper, we extend our previous work and create a fuzzy color map to visualize the distribution of Wi-Fi signal: red represents strong signals and blue represents weak signals. Then we make use of the proposed map by selecting the best candidates of AP to increase the positioning accuracy in the poor Wi-Fi coverage region. Our experiment result shows that we can reduce the distance error significantly by 25% in a poor Wi-Fi coverage environment and locate a person within 1.75m in average. The proposed method leads to substantially more accurate and robust localization system. © 2011 IEEE.","Fuzzy Logic; Indoor positioning; Location Awareness; Location Fingerprinting; Newton Trust Region; Social Networks; Wi-Fi Localization","Indoor positioning; Location Awareness; Location Fingerprinting; Social Networks; Trust region; Drops; Fuzzy logic; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Sensors; Standards; Wi-Fi",,,,,"Jan, R., Lee, Y., An indoor geolocation system for wireless LANs (2003) International Conference, Parallel Processing Workshops, pp. 29-34; Prasithsangaree, P., Krishnamurthy, P., Chrysanthis, P., On indoor position location with wireless LANs (2002) The 13th IEEE International Symposium, Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, 2; Kwon, J., Dundar, B., Varaiya, P., Hybrid algorithm for indoor positioning using wireless LAN (2004) IEEE 60th Vehicular Technology Conference, VTC, 7; Taheri, A., Singh, A., Emmanuel, A., Location fingerprinting on infrastructure 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) using locus (2004) Proceedings of the 29th Annual IEEE International Conference on Local Computer Networks, pp. 676-683; Kaemarungsi, K., Krishnamurthy, P., Modeling of indoor positioning systems based on location fingerprinting (2004) INFOCOM.

The originality of the paper comes from some blocks proposal, which selective amplify the biosignals. One of the major problems in the electrophysiological monitoring is the difficulty to record the weak signals from deep organs that are covered by noise and the cardiac or muscular strong signals. An automatic gain control block is used, so that the high power skin signals are less amplified than the low components. The analog processing block is based on a dynamic range compressor, containing the automatic gain control block. The following block is a clipper since to capture all the transitions that escape from the dynamic range compressor. At clipper output a lowpass filter is connected since to abruptly cut the high frequencies. The data vector recording is performing by strong internal resources microcontroller including ten bits A/D conversion port. Design of analogical blocks is assisted by electronics circuit's simulation and optimization.","Compressor technique; Design; Electrophysiological signal; Health care; Simulation","A/D conversion; Analog processing; Automatic gain control; Biosignals; Continuous processing; Data vectors; Dynamic range; Electronics circuits; Electrophysiological signal; Hardware solutions; High frequency; In-vivo; Internal resources; Optimisations; Simulation; Simulation and optimization; Strong signal; Weak signals; Analog to digital conversion; Compressors; Computer simulation; Design; Electrophysiology; Hardware; Health care; Optimization; Gain control",,,,,"Květina, J., Varayil, J.E., Ali, S.M., Kuneš, M., Bureš, J., Tachecí, I., Rejchrt, S., Kopáčová, M., Preclinical electrogastrography in experimental pigs (2010) International Journal of Interdiscip.

In order to obtain accurate acoustic wave flight time in the acoustic temperature measurement of power station boiler, we have studied the acoustic signal time delay estimation for the weak signal detection in strong noise environment. The noise of the furnace which is collected from a domestic power plant has been made spectral analysis and statistical analysis. And it shows that the furnace noise which focuses on the center frequency of 250-1000 Hz low-frequency combustion noise was Gaussian-like distribution. This paper introduces the measurement of flight time based on the correlation function in the acoustic pyrometry. The realization principle of measurement method has been detailed. Through making a specific analysis with field data it is concluded that direct correlation method of acoustic flight time measurement has high precision and strong anti-interference ability, therefore, it is applied to measure the acoustic time of flight in the industrial environment. © 2011 IEEE.","Acoustic sensor; Background noise; Boiler; Direct correlation; Time delay","Acoustic method; Acoustic pyrometry; Acoustic Sensors; Acoustic signals; Acoustic temperature measurement; Anti-interference; Background noise; Center frequency; Combustion noise; Correlation function; Experimental studies; Field data; Flight time; Gaussian-like distributions; High precision; High-precision temperature measurements; Industrial environments; Low frequency; Measurement accuracy; Measurement methods; Noise environments; Power station boiler; Realization principle; Time of flight; Weak signal detection; Acoustics; Artificial intelligence; Boilers; Measurements; Power plants; Spectrum analysis; Temperature measurement; Time delay; Acoustic noise",,,,,"Han, S., Zhou, H., Feng, S., Study on reconstruction and fast characteristic recognition of temperature distributions in a 2-D furnace via radiant energy images with sensitive measurement errors[J] (2000) Proceedings of the CSEE, 20 (9), pp. 67-71; An, L., Shen, G., Genshan, J., Acoustic method for measuring flue gas temperature in the furnace and determination of its temperature field[J] (2004) Thermal Power Generation, 33 (9), pp. 40-42; Tian, F., Shao, F., Wang, F., Comprehensive survey of temperature field detection techniques used acoustic in furnace [J] (2002) Instrument Technique and Sensor, 4, pp. 52-54; Chen, C., Wei, C., Deng, Z., The design of adaptive time delay estimation algorithm for pipeline leak detection[J] (2003) Industrial Instrumentation & Automation, (6), pp. 25-28; Xiaodong, Z., Bo, G., Song, Z., The research of acoustic measuring of gas temperature employing cross-correlation algorithm[J] (2003) Proceedings of the Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering, 23 (4), pp. 185-188; Holstein, P., Raabe, A., Muller, R., Acoustic tomography on the basis of travel-time measurement [J] (2004) Measurement Science & Technology, 15 (6), pp. 1240-1248; Bo, Z., An, L., Shen, G., Error analysis of acoustic pyrometer based on cross-correlation method[J] (2006) Electric Power Science and Engineering, 1, pp. 45-47","Tian, F.; School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, China; email: tianfeng5861@163.com",,"Xidian University;HIC;Beijing Normal University;Guangdong University of Technology",,"2011 7th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security, CIS 2011","3 December 2011 through 4 December 2011","Sanya, Hainan",88263,,9780769545844,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

It involves the simple technology integration of the linear and nonlinear methodologies. Raman spectra are essentially weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, while the background spectra (e.g., fluorescence spectra) act as another primary intensity component in the raw Raman spectrograph. Thus the calibrated Raman spectra from measurements are subject to detrend and denoising so as to extract the intrinsic spectra, which contain solely the unique spectral signatures of the individual biomedical samples. By removing the slowly varying baseline background spectra and rapidly varying noises, intrinsic Raman spectra could be extracted using a combination of linear and nonlinear methodologies. The goal is to capture the distinguishable wave number information on the Raman shift for feature identification. This approach is crucial for spectra analysis to associate Raman spectra with the medical diagnosis. Considering the slowly varying nature of background spectra such as fluorescence, linear least squares estimation is applied to detrend the background spectra from the measured spectra being calibrated. Since most noises are rapidly varying, nonlinear discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising is applied to separate the intrinsic Raman spectra from noises for spectral identification. This approach is proposed so as to differentiate the normal spectra from the abnormal spectra of the fresh mice lung samples. Numerical simulation outcomes include the calibrated Raman spectra, detrended spectra free of background effects and the extracted intrinsic spectra after nonlinear DWT denoising. The satisfactory results indicate that the proposed simple linear and nonlinear technology integration provides a useful approach for biomedical sample characterization. In addition, it reduces computational complexity compared with artificial intelligence approaches, which has no technical difficulty in real time medical diagnosis implementation. This serves as a fundamental step for further data clustering and accurate decision making among numerous diverse samples. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Abnormal spectra; Background spectra; Data clustering; De-noising; Feature identification; Fluorescence spectra; Linear least squares; Nonlinear technology; Raman shift; Real time; SIMPLE technology; Spectra analysis; Spectral calibration; Spectral feature extraction; Spectral signature; Technical difficulties; Wave numbers; Weak signals; Artificial intelligence; Characterization; Clustering algorithms; Computational complexity; Diagnosis; Discrete wavelet transforms; Feature extraction; Fluorescence; Information science; Integration; Noise pollution control; Raman scattering",,,,,"Gonzalez, R., Woods, R., (2007) Digital Image Processing, , 3rd Edition, Prentice-Hall; Edwards, H.G.M., Gniadecka, M., Petersen, S., Hart, H.J.P., Faurskov, N.O., Christensen, D.H., Wulf, H.C., NIR-FT Raman spectroscopy as a diagnostic probe for mummified skin and nails (2002) Vibrational Spectroscopy, 28 (1), pp. 3-15. , DOI 10.1016/S0924-2031(01)00141-2, PII S0924203101001412; Shim, M., Song, L., Marcon, N., Wilson, B., Vivo Near-Infrared Raman Spectroscopy: Demonstration of Feasibility (2000) Photochemistry and Photobiology, pp. 146-150; Brennan, J., Wang, Y., Chandra, R., Dasari, R., Feld, M., Near- Infrared Raman Spectrometer Systems for Human Tissues Studies (1997) Applied Spectroscopy, 51 (2), pp. 201-207; Sonerira, M., Perex-Pueyo, R., Ruiz-Moreno, S., Raman Spectra Enhancement with a Fuzzy Logic Approach (2002) Journal of Raman Spectroscopy, pp. 599-603; Ye, Z., Manda, P., Auner, G., Raman Spectra Calibration, Extraction and Neural Network Based Training for Sample Identification (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 622-626. , July 20-24, Portland, Oregon, USA; Ye, Z., Auner, G., Raman Spectrum Baseline Identification and Its Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control, pp. 489-494. , Sept. 2-4, Taipei, Taiwan; Ye, Z., Artificial-intelligence approach for biomedical sample characterization using raman spectroscopy (2005) IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 2 (1), pp. 67-73. , DOI 10.1109/TASE.2004.840071; Ye, Z., Auner, G., Principal Component Analysis for Biomedical Sample Identification (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, pp. 1348-1353. , Oct. 10-13, Hague, Netherlands; Ye, Z., Mohamadian, H., Ye, Y., Information Measures for Biometric Identification via 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (2007) 2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, pp. 835-840. , Sept. 22-25, Scottsdale, USA; Taplidou, S., Hadjileontiadis, L., Analysis of Wheezes Using Wavelet Higher Order Spectral Features (2010) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 57 (7), pp. 1596-1610. , July; Vukelic, S., Kongsuwan, P., Ryu, S., Yao, Y., Ultrafast Laser Induced Structural Modification of Fused Silica - Part II: Spatially Resolved and Decomposed Raman Spectral Analysis (2010) Transactions of the ASME, Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, 132 (6); Dinç, E., Demirkaya, F., Baleanu, D., New Approach for Simultaneous Spectral Analysis of a Complex Mixture Using the Fractional Wavelet Transform (2010) Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 15 (4), pp. 812-818. , April","Ye, Z.; College of Engineering, Southern University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States; email: zhengmaoye@engr.subr.edu",,,,"12th IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics, CINTI 2011","21 November 2011 through 22 November 2011","Budapest",88119,,9781457700453,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Although a rich body of knowledge exists, concepts are not often used in practice. This article contributes a literature review addressing six findings for ESS design to become more applicable than the state of the art. They are structured by the elements of information systems (IS) design theories. Addressing the lack of a sound requirements analysis, our first finding proposes a 360- degree ESS for executives' ""managing a company"" task and presents how to select just the most important scanning areas to keep focus. Three other findings cover the IS model perspective focusing on a better ""grasp"" of weak signals: define concrete indicators and use IT to identify relevant cause-effective-chains, leverage IT to automate day-to-day routines and monitor the variety of indicators' movements, and leverage expert experience and translate indicators' impact into a balanced opportunity-and-threat portfolio. From the methods perspective on ESS, we fifth propose to incorporate scanning results into executives' decision-making process more closely by generating scenarios from a set of assumptions and the development of indicators. Retrospective controls to update the ESS continuously and collaboration to share the scanning findings in day-to-day operation is our sixth finding. Finally, an instantiation at a large international company helped us validate our findings and to highlight how current developments in IS contribute to successful design, implementation, and day-to-day operation of new-generation ESS.","Balanced chance and risk management; Business intelligence information systems (IS) design; Corporate management","Body of knowledge; Corporate management; Day-to-day operations; Decision making process; Design theory; Economic crisis; Environmental scanning; Expert experience; International company; Literature reviews; Requirements analysis; Scanning area; State of the art; Weak signals; Design; Imaging systems; Industry; Information systems; Risk management; Sustainable development; Scanning",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , 1st Edition.

An instantaneous frequency based algorithm (the IGN-IF method) was recently proposed and shown to be capable of resolving weak signals that are not discernible using the traditional FFT based techniques. In this work we develop a modified IGN-IF (MIGN-IF) algorithm that is adaptive to the decay rates of the signal components. In particular, we develop expressions that permit the parameters of the Gabor filterbank and estimation step to be determined from the decay factor. Simulation results show significant performance improvement of the MIG-IF over the original IGN-IF algorithm. We also compare the MIGN-IF method to the information theoretic criteria matrix pencil (ITCMP) method. Although the estimation variance of the ITCMP method is slightly lower than that of the MIGN-IF algorithm, the ITCMP has a much heavier computational cost and significantly higher breakdown threshold, making it practical only at high SNRs and for short data records. © 2011 IEEE.","damped complex exponential; discrete Fourier transform; Gabor filter bank; Instantaneous frequency; nuclear magnetic resonanace","Breakdown threshold; Computational costs; damped complex exponential; Data records; Decay factor; Decay rate; Estimation variance; Gabor filter banks; Information theoretic criterion; Instantaneous frequency; Matrix pencil; NMR data; nuclear magnetic resonanace; Performance improvements; Signal components; Weak signals; Adaptive algorithms; Decay (organic); Digital signal processing; Discrete Fourier transforms; Filter banks; Frequency estimation; Information theory; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Data handling",,,,,"Griffin, J.L., Metabolic profiles to define the genome: Can we hear the phenotypes?

First, the effectiveness of frequency domain in accumulation and wavelet transform in denosing is presented respectively.

In this paper, a ubiquitous computing platform is designed for quality control of multimedia and data context through the Internet to users. Traffic content should be properly classified, whether it is in real-time or non-real-time, casual or critical, data or multimedia. Furthermore, a session may be a combination of different traffic types. Information about classifications may be identified through the communications between content providers and clients, or through direct communication between the platform and providers or clients. It is the goal of the proposed Quality of Service (QoS) control framework which provides mechanisms for delivering satisfactory content to subscribers, through content adaptation and selections. The focus of this paper will be on setting real-time performance bound regarding multimedia traffic. Traffic becomes redundant and useless when delivered information exceeds the delay tolerance of human beings. In the proposed platform, modifications are executed through the agent technology inside the Internet. Thorough experiments have been carried out, and the impacts of real-time bounds are examined.

Applying a gliding window of proper length to truncate infinite signal into finite length, then calculating the autocorrelation function of the signal in the window, choosing the Nth point as the current output, finally, an envelope which represents the position and intense of the signal can be obtained, while the noise can be eliminated according to its non-relativity. This is especially suitable for detecting weak signal with unknown parameters under the background of band-limited noise.

But there exists serious decline in high-frequency channel, which presents great difficulties to the detection and identification of CW telegraph signals. The traditional detection method based on time-frequency transformation has a poor performance in strong noise environment. An advanced detection method that combines non-linear bi-stable stochastic resonance model and time frequency analysis is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the received CW signal was modulated to a certain low frequency, and filtered by stochastic resonance model to restore its waveform from strong noise environment. Secondly, the WVD transformation and Hough transformation were utilised to extract its time domain features of the restored waveform. Thus, the detection of CW telegraph signal was easily implemented by detecting the peak values in parameters space. The simulation studies and results showed that the new method performs very well in the detection of CW signal with low signal noise ratio.","High-frequency CW telegraph; Hough transform; Morse code; Stochastic resonance; Weak signal detection; WVD transform","High-frequency CW telegraph; Morse codes; Stochastic resonances; Weak signal detection; WVD transform; Circuit resonance; Feature extraction; Hough transforms; Magnetic resonance; Mathematical transformations; Restoration; Signaling; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Switching systems; Telegraph; Time domain analysis; Signal detection",,,,,"Asdi, A.S., Tewfik, A.H., Detection of weak signals using adaptive stochastic resonance (1995) IEEE.

Watermark signature, which is often in the form of a sequence of pseudo randomly generated number, is traditionally embedded using a linear function of the sequence and the image signal. The use of a high order or non-linear embedding function is proposed in this paper in order to improve the robustness of the watermark from attacks such as low pass filtering, additive noise and cropping. The embedding process is carried out in the wavelet domain as it is considered as the most robust domain for watermarking in the literature. Experiment results show that the correlation coefficient, a measure to detect the presence of a weak signal in a composite signal, produced using the proposed technique is in the order of magnitude higher than those produced via a traditional method for a given PSNR value. This in effect proves that the proposed technique is more robust that the latter.","Digital image watermark; High order polynomial; Non-linear; Wavelet transform","Correlation coefficient; Digital image; Digital image watermark; Digital image watermarking; Embedding process; High order; High order polynomial; Image signal; Linear functions; Low-pass filtering; Non-linear; Order of magnitude; Robust domain; Signature data; Wavelet domain; Wavelet-transform domain; Weak signals; Computer crime; Digital watermarking; Image processing; Internet; Mathematical transformations; Military photography; Multimedia systems; Polynomials; Wavelet transforms; Watermarking",,,,,"Piva, A., Barni, M., Bartolini, F., Cappellini, V., DCT-based watermark recovering without resorting to the uncorrupted original image (1997) Proc.

This approach for discovery of genetic risk factors has yielded promising results, but most of the analyses have focused on single marker tests. In general, a method of analysis that uses the markers as if they are biologically unrelated throws away all the information contained in the structure of the genome. In this paper, we propose a method for incorporating structural genomic information by grouping the markers in relevant units, and assigning a measure of significance to these pre-defined sets of markers. The sets can be genes, conserved regions, or groups of genes such as pathways. Using the proposed methods and algorithms, evidence for association between a particular functional unit and a disease status can be obtained not just by the presence of a strong signal from a SNP within it, but also by the combination of several simultaneous weaker signals that are uncorrelated. Note that the method will combine evidence for association from both the genotyped and the untyped markers. The untyped markers are tested using haplotype predictors for their alleles, with the prediction training done in reference databases such as HapMap. There are several advantages in using this approach. There is an increase in the power of detecting genes associated to disease because moderately strong signals within a gene are combined to obtain a much stronger signal for the gene as a functional unit. The results are easily combined across platforms that use different sets of SNP. Lastly, the results are easy to interpret since the refer to functional regions, and they also provide targets for biological validation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Complex traits; Conserved regions; Functional unit; Genetic risks; Genome-wide association; Genomic information; Genotyping; Haplotype; High throughputs; Human genomes; International symposium; Marker testing; Method of analysis; Strong signal; Uncorrelated; Biocommunications; Bioinformatics; Chlorine compounds; Digital signal processing; Information science; Risk assessment; Genes",,,,,,"Nicolae, D.

Processing coherently with long integration time is an efficient way to improve the sensitivity of GPS receiver. However, because of the transition of the navigation data bits, the integration time has to be limited. How to detect the transition of navigation data bits is the key issue to prolong the coherent integration time in weak signal environment. In this paper, some conventional acquisition technologies are studied carefully and the idea of optimum path is introduced. Optimum path algorithm is employed to minimize the cost function which determines the transition of navigation data bits. Furthermore, the whole acquisition algorithm based on the optimum path is given. This novel algorithm process the received data coherently with longer integration time and without any squared loss. Compared with other algorithm, the new method can reduce computing burden dramatically. The acquisition rate expression is also deduced. Simulations show that the new algorithm can effectively improve the acquisition rate. When integration time equals 80 ms, SNR equals -40 dB, the new optimum path algorithm still has as high as 92% acquisition rate which remarkably improves the sensitivity of GPS receiver.","Coherent integration; Doppler frequency shift; Global positioning system (GPS); Incoherent integration; Optimum path; Squared loss",,,,,,"Liu, Y., (2005) GPS Satellite Navigation System Theory and Practice, , Beijing: Science Press, in Chinese; van Dierendonck, A.J., GPS receivers (1996) Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications, 1, pp. 329-407. , Parkinson B.W. and Spilker Jr.J.J.(ed.), Washington: American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Tsui, J.B.-Y., (2005) Fundamentals of Global Positioning System Receivers: A Software Approach, 2nd Edition, pp. 224-236. , Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, Inc; Ledvina, B.M., Psiaki, M.L., Powell, S.P., Bitwise parallel algorithms for efficient software correlation applied to a GPS software receiver (2004) IEEE Trans on Wireless Communications, 3 (5), pp. 1469-1473; Akopian, D., Fast FFT based GPS satellite acquisition methods (2005) IEE Proceedings Radar, Sonar and Navigation, 152 (4), pp. 277-286; van Nee, C., Coenen, A., New fast GPS code-acquisition technique using FFT (1991) Electronics Letters, 27 (2), pp. 158-160; Cai, F., Yin, Y., Zhang, X., Research on signal processing algorithms in GPS receivers (2007) Progress in Astronomy, 25 (1), pp. 84-95. , in Chinese; Zhang, Y., Lin, B., Xu, Z., Study on simulation of signal search acquisition in software GPS receiver (2006) Journal of System Simulation, 18 (9), pp. 2646-2649. , in Chinese; Lin, D.M., Tsui, J.B.Y., A software GPS receiver for weak signals (2007), http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=967337; Elders-Boll, H., Dettmar, U., Efficient differentially coherent code/Doppler acquisition of weak GPS signals (2007) 2004 IEEE 8th Int'l Symp on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications, , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1371796; Chuang, M.-Y., Feng, K.-T., Adaptive GPS acquisition technique in weak signal environment (2007) IEEE 63rd Vehicular Technology Conference, , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1683340; Psiaki, M.L., Block acquisition of weak GPS signals in a software receiver (2007) Proc of ION GPS, , http://www.mae.Cornell.edu/Psiaki/gpsweeksignal_r2_cv.pdf; Ziedan, N.I., Garrison, J.L., Unaided acquisition of weak GPS signals using circular correlation or double-block zero padding (2007) Position Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS 2004), , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1309030","Qin, X.; Graduate University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China; email: qinxinxian@ict.ac.cn",,,,,,,,10001239,,JYYFE,,"Chinese","Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-54749118230

This paper proposes a novel method for distinguishing the signal and the noise by the statistical property of themselves, based on higher order statistical feature extraction using independent component analysis (ICA). Because ICA transform increases the difference of the statistical property between the speech and the noise, the speech and the noise can be distinguished in the ICA domain. On the basis, the characteristics called the ICA energy (ICAE) and the filtered ICAE (FICAE) are used for the noisy signal endpoint detection. Experimental results show that the endpoint detection method combining FICAE and ICAE has certain stability at various signal-to-noise ratios, and can effectively detect the speech endpoints at very low signal-to-noise ratio. Thus the method has good robust performance and provides a new approach for detecting endpoints of weak signals under noisy environments.","Distinction of signal and noise; Endpoint detection; Independent component analysis; Statistical property",,,,,,,"He, Q.; Department of Precision Machinery and Precision Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China; email: heqb@ustc.edu",,,,,,,,10049037,,SCYCE,,"Chinese","Shu Ju Cai Ji Yu Chu Li",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247271321

However, most of watermark detection algorithms in the literature are neither with strong theoretical grounds, nor are they optimum. Proposed in this paper is a new discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain watermark detection scheme, with the theory of weak signal detection in non-Gaussian noise as its theoretical grounds. Special attention is paid to the case where embedding strength parameter of the watermark signal is not known at the detection stage. First, generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) is chosen to statistically model the wavelet coefficients of the detailed sub-bands data. Then, the model of deterministic signal detection with unknown parameters is utilized to formulate the watermark detection. As a result, an asymptotically optimal detector is constructed. The performance analysis of the new detector shows that it can achieve the constant false alarm rate property. The theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results. And the superiority of the novel detector over conventional detection methods is also confirmed.","Constant false alarm rate; Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Generalized Gaussian distribution; Weak signal detection","Algorithms; Copyrights; Cryptography; Data privacy; Mathematical transformations; Security of data; Signal detection; Signal processing; Wavelet transforms; Blind watermark detection; Constant false alarm rate; Detection stage; Detector design; Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Generalized Gaussian distribution; Non Gaussian noise; Performance analysis; Sub bands data; Theoretical analysis; Theoretical grounds; Watermark detection algorithm; Watermark signal; Watermarking scheme; Wavelet coefficients; Weak signal detection; Digital watermarking",,,,,"Cox, I.J., Miller, L., Bloom, A., (2002) Digital Watermarking, , New York: Morgan Kaufmann; Poor, H.V., (1994) An Introduction to Signal and Estimation, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Chen, T.P.-C., Chen, T., A framework for optimal blind watermark detection (2001) CM Multimedia 2001 Workshop on Multimedia and Security: New Challenges, , Ottawa, Canada; Mallat, S., A theory of multi-resolution signal decomposition: The wavelet representation (1999) IEEE Trans on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 11 (7), pp. 674-693; Antonini, M., Barlaud, M., Mathieu, P., Image coding using wavelet transform (1992) IEEE Trans on Image Processing, 1 (2), pp. 205-220; Hernández, J.R., Amado, M., Pérez-González, F., DCT-domain watermarking techniques for still images: Detector performance analysis and a new structure (2000) IEEE Trans on Image Processing, 9 (1), pp. 55-68; Bo, X., Shen, L., Adaptive detection for blind image watermarking in DCT domain (2002) Journal of Computer Research and Development, 39 (4), pp. 502-510. , in Chinese; Modestino, J.W., Adaptive detection of signals in impulsive noise environments (1977) IEEE Trans on Comm, 25 (9), pp. 1022-1027; Cheng, Q., Huang, T.S., An additive approach to transformed-domain information hiding and optimum detection structure (2001) IEEE Trans on Multimedia, 3 (3), pp. 273-283; Cheng, Q., Huang, T.S., Robust optimum detection of transform domain multiplicative watermarks (2003) IEEE Trans on Signal Processing, 51 (4), pp. 906-924; Sun, Z., Zhu, Y., Feng, D., The performance analysis of DCT-domain watermark detection based on local optimum detection (2005) Acta Elctronica Sinica, 33 (5), pp. 864-867. , in Chinese; Jin, C., Peng, J., Optimal estimation of the embedding strength for the digital image watermarking (2004) Infrared and Laser Engineering, 33 (2), pp. 174-177. , in Chinese; Kassam, S.A., (1988) Signal Detection in Non-Gaussian Noise, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Buccigrossi, R.W., Simoncelli, P., Image compression via joint statistical characterization in the wavelet domain (1999) IEEE Trans on Image Processing, 8 (12), pp. 1688-1701; Kay, S.M., (1998) Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Detection: Detection Theory, , New York: Prentice Hall","Sun, Z.; Department of Information Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China; email: sunzwcn@yahoo.com.cn",,,"Science Press",,,,,10001239,,JYYFE,,"Chinese","Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845906664

There is also an important increase in the number of broadband-connected homes, and many new services are being deployed by broadband providers, such as TV and VoIP. The home network is thus becoming the ""media hub"" of the house. This trend is expected to continue, and to expand into the Consumer Electronics (CE) market as well. This means new devices that can tap into the network in order to get their data, such as wireless TV sets, gaming consoles, tablet PCs, etc. As more and more devices are networked, we may see a new bottleneck, namely the wireless LAN (WLAN). The most widely deployed wireless technologies for home networks are currently IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g, which provide nominal top bandwidths of 11 and 54Mbps respectively. To a lesser extent, there are also Bluetooth connected devices, which can work at about 2Mbps in good conditions. In practice, the throughputs observed in wi-fi networks range from 4-5Mbps for 802.11b to 20-25Mbps to 802.11g. Besides, the network performance varies depending on the topology of the network, environmental parameters, and interference from other equipment. These performances are low when compared to current Ethernet LANs (100Mbps - 1Gbps), but the lack of cabling makes wireless networking an attractive option for home use. As new devices, applications and services continue to be developed, it is very likely that the load imposed on the network will increase, shifting the bottleneck from the access network to the wireless links. Besides the limited bandwidth available in wi-fi, the nature of wireless networks is such that their performance is very variable. Impairments due to the position of the hosts, multi-path propagation, hosts with weaker signal strength, etc. might drastically decrease the network's performance at any time. This in turn implies a strong variability in the perceived quality of real-time applications such as voice streams, which may have a big impact on the adoption of these new technologies. In this paper we study the quality of VoIP flows in the context described above. To this end, we propose a stochastic model for the wi-fi network, which closely mimics its performance variations. In order to perform the quality assessments, we couple this model with a Neural Network-based quality assessment tool [1, 2], which provides MOS results that correlate very well with human perception.",,"Bandwidth; Carrier communication; Consumer electronics; Home networks; Internet telephony; Personal communication systems; Personal computers; Sound reproduction; Standards; Voice/data communication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Broadband providers; Environmental parameter; Perceived quality; Performance variations; Quality assessment; Real-time application; Wireless networking; Wireless technologies; Wi-Fi",,,,,"Mohamed, S., Rubino, G., Varela, M., A method for quantitative evaluation of audio quality over packet networks and its comparison with existing techniques (2004) Proceedings of the Measurement of Speech and Audio Quality in Networks Workshop (MESAQIN'04), , Prague, Czech Republic June; Rubino, G., Varela, M.N., A new approach for the prediction of end-to-end performance of multimedia streams (2004) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of Systems (QEST'04), , Enschede, The Netherlands September; Keppes, M., Garg, S., (2003) Can i Add A VoIP Call?

This concept is not only applicable to single threshold systems but can also be applied to dynamical systems with multiple attractor states, such as observed during the phenomenon of binocular rivalry. Binocular rivalry can be characterized by marginally stable attractor states between which the brain switches in a spontaneous, stochastic manner. Here we used a computational model to predict the effect of noise on perceptual dominance durations. Subsequently we compared the model prediction to a series of experiments where we measured binocular rivalry dynamics when noise (zero-mean Gaussian random noise) was added either to the visual stimulus (Exp. 1) or directly to the visual cortex (Exp. 2) by applying transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS 1 mA, 100–640 Hz zero -mean Gaussian random noise). We found that adding noise significantly reduced the mixed percept duration (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2). Our results are the first to demonstrate that both central and peripheral noise can influence state-switching dynamics of binocular rivalry under specific conditions (e.g. low visual contrast stimuli), in line with a SR-mechanism. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,,,,,"McDonnell, M.D., Abbott, D., What is stochastic resonance?

From the point of view of demand modelling, car sharing is a weak signal in the city landscape: only a small percentage of the population uses it, and thus it is difficult to study reliably with traditional techniques such as households travel diaries. In this work, we depart from these traditional approaches and we leverage web-based, digital records about vehicle availability in 10 European cities for one of the major active car sharing operators. We discuss which sociodemographic and urban activity indicators are associated with variations in car sharing demand, which forecasting approach (among the most popular in the related literature) is better suited to predict pickup and drop-off events, and how the spatio-temporal information about vehicle availability can be used to infer how different zones in a city are used by customers. We conclude the paper by presenting a direct application of the analysis of the dataset, aimed at identifying where to locate maintenance facilities within the car sharing operation area. © 2019, The Author(s).","Car sharing; Data mining; Smart transportation; Urban computing","Data mining; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; Demand modelling; Maintenance facility; Parking demands; Spatiotemporal information; Traditional approaches; Traditional techniques; Transportation infrastructures; Urban computing; Electronic document exchange",,,,,"Mitchell, W.J., Borroni-Bird, C.E., Burns, L.D., (2010) Reinventing the automobile.

This paper explores the process that outperforming managers used to detect and interpret weak signals. Interviews with 13 top-managers were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to allow the process to emerge. The findings confirmed earlier conclusions on perceptual filters that reduce the number and type of signals assessed. Contrary to earlier findings, the process was significantly altered to compensate for this loss in two ways. First, managers deliberately postponed their assessment of a weak signal by discussing it with people with distinct and second, some managers deliberately searched for signals that were unfamiliar and not fitting their mental model. The sample consisted of outperforming top managers, which raised questions about the generalizability of the findings in specific directions: are the alterations in the weak signal process exemplary for outperformers only, and how does its success compare to formal foresight methods.

The recent discovery of the earliest processed drugs may provide strong evidence for the origins of traditional Chinese medicine processing. The remains were found in wooden lacquer boxes, unearthed from Haihunhou tomb in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province. By analyzing the appearance of the unearthed samples, it was found that the outer layers of the samples were composed of an auxiliary material and the inside was composed of plant material. As can be seen from the three-dimensional image taken using nuclear magnetic resonance screening, the sample had a hollow irregular rod structure. The outer layers were composed of a substance with weak signal strength, and the inside was similar to the fiber structure of plants with high water contents. Microscopic analysis showed that periderm, secondary xylem, and broad wood rays could be seen in the transverse section of the plants inside the samples. It can be further speculated that the plants inside the samples were derived from the roots or stems of dicotyledonous herbs. Additionally, the putative roots or stems of the dicotyledonous herbs had secondary structures and contained one to three clustered, red-brown cells. No starch granules, calcium oxalate crystals, or stone cells were observed in the transverse section. According to the microscopic database of the National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, it is speculated that the plants inside the samples were derived from the roots of Rehmannia species. A comparative study of the microscopic characteristics of wild Rehmannia chingii roots and the unearthed samples was carried out. It was found that both displayed periderm, broad secondary phloem, wood rays, similar vessel morphologies, and red-brown cells. The unearthed samples and R. chingii roots were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in negative ion mode. The results showed that the mass spectrum peak of m/z 623 in the unearthed samples agreed with that in the roots of R. chingii, and was putatively identified as acteoside or forsythiaside. Moreover, the peak at m/z 179 in the unearthed samples was identified as caffeic acid based on the molecular weight using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and was usually identified as a hydrolysate of acteoside or forsythiaside. There were about two to three outer layers of excipient on the samples. They were distributed unevenly, thicker at the top and thinner at the bottom. The plants and excipient layers were observed by microscope, and starch grains were found in the cross section and powder of the excipient layers, while no starch grains were found in the cross section or powder of the plant material inside. However, the reaction between the plant tissues and iodine-potassium iodide test solution produced the characteristic blue color. This phenomenon was related to the gelatinization of starch granules. Under a polarized light microscope, a large number of crystals were seen in the excipient layers. An aqueous extract of the excipient layers was analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS), and an ion fragment peak at m/z 341.11 was detected, indicating a disaccharide. When compared to the reference substances glucose, sucrose, fructose, and maltose, the retention times and mass spectra were very similar to that of sucrose. According to ancient literary and historical records, the tomb owner suffered from severe rheumatism before his death, which is consistent with the efficacy of R. chingii. It is further speculated that the samples in the wooden lacquer boxes are the remains of processed ancient traditional Chinese medicine products. The origin of the excipients in the processed medicines might be related to improving the taste, which could provide a scientific basis for further understanding the processing and application of ancient traditional Chinese medicines. © 2019, Science Press.

In other words, detection of the weak signal is a big challenge. Here, we investigate approximated fractional integrator (AFI) based detector. The proposed method has been employed for detection of DC signal which is present in the Gaussian noise. Our proposed method has been compared with some state-of-the-art methods in terms of probability of detection (P-{D}) for a constant value of probability of false alarm (P-{FA}). The P-{D} has been plotted for varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a constant value of P-{FA}. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method for watermark application. The outcomes of the proposed method are convincing and it suggests that the proposed method works better or comparable to some state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 APSIPA organization.",,"Biomedical engineering; Gaussian noise (electronic); Signal to noise ratio; Constant values; Fractional integrators; Probability of detection; Probability of false alarm; Radar communication; Signal processing applications; State-of-the-art methods; Weak signal detection; Signal detection",,,,,"Kay, S.M., (1998) Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing: Detection Theory, , Prentice-Hall; McBride, A.C., (1986) Fractional Calculus, , New York: Halsted Press; Oldham, K.B., Spanier, (1974) The Fractional Calculus: Integrations and Differentiations of Arbitrary Order, , New York: Academic; Miller, K.S., Derivatives of noninteger order (1995) Mathematics Magazine, 68 (3), pp. 183-192; Guo, G., Mandal, M., Jing, Y., A robust detector of known signal in non-Gaussian noise using threshold systems (2012) Signal Processing, 92 (11), pp. 2676-2688; Urkowitz, H., Energy detection of unknown deterministic signals (1967) Proceedings of the IEEE, pp. 523-531; Engheta, N., On fractional calculus and fractional multipoles in electromagnetism (1996) IEEE Trans.

This may result in biased prediction, especially when weak signals outnumber strong signals. This paper aims to incorporate weak signals in variable selection, estimation, and prediction. We propose a two-stage procedure, consisting of variable selection and postselection estimation. The variable selection stage involves a covariance-insured screening for detecting weak signals, whereas the postselection estimation stage involves a shrinkage estimator for jointly estimating strong and weak signals selected from the first stage. We term the proposed method as the covariance-insured screening-based postselection shrinkage estimator. We establish asymptotic properties for the proposed method and show, via simulations, that incorporating weak signals can improve estimation and prediction performance. We apply the proposed method to predict the annual gross domestic product rates based on various socioeconomic indicators for 82 countries. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","high-dimensional data; Lasso; post-selection shrinkage estimation; variable selection; weak signal detection","Clustering algorithms; Forecasting; Shrinkage; High dimensional data; Lasso; Shrinkage estimations; Variable selection; Weak signal detection; Signal detection",,,,,"Tibshirani, R., Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso (1996) J Royal Stat Soc Ser B, 58 (1), pp. 267-288; Zou, H., The adaptive Lasso and its oracle properties (2006) J Am Stat Assoc, 101 (476), pp. 1418-1429; Yuan, M., Lin, Y., Model selection and estimation in regression with grouped variables (2006) J Royal Stat Soc Ser B, 68 (1), pp. 49-67; Fan, J., Li, R., Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties (2001) J Am Stat Assoc, 96 (456), pp. 1348-1360; Zhang, C.-H., Nearly unbiased variable selection under minimax concave penalty (2010) Ann Stat, 38 (2), pp. 894-942; Zhang, C.-H., Zhang, S.S., Confidence intervals for low dimensional parameters in high dimensional linear models (2014) J Royal Stat Soc Ser B, 76 (1), pp. 217-242; Mazumder, R., Hastie, T., Exact covariance thresholding into connected components for large-scale graphical Lasso (2012) J Mach Learn Res, 13, pp. 781-794; Bickel, P.J., Levina, E., Covariance regularization by thresholding (2008) Ann Stat, 36 (6), pp. 2577-2604; Fan, J., Liao, Y., Mincheva, M., High-dimensional covariance matrix estimation in approxiamte factor models (2011) Ann Stat, 39 (6), pp. 3320-3356; Shao, J., Wang, Y., Deng, X., Wang, S., Sparse linear discriminant analysis by thresholding for high-dimensional data (2011) Ann Stat, 39 (2), pp. 1241-1265; Gao, X., Ahmed, S.E., Feng, Y., Post selection shrinkage estimation for high-dimensional data analysis (2017) Appl Stoch Model Bus Ind, 33 (2), pp. 97-120; Zhang, C.-H., Huang, J., The sparsity and bias of the Lasso selection in high dimensional linear regression (2008) Ann Stat, 36 (4), pp. 1567-1594; Barro, R., Lee, J., (1994) Data set for a panel of 139 countries, NBER, , http://admin.nber.org/pub/barro.lee/; Bodmer, W., Bonilla, C., Common and rare variants in multifactorial susceptibility to common diseases (2008) Nat Genet, 40 (6), pp. 695-701; Li, B., Leal, S.M., Methods for detecting associations with rare variants for common diseases: application to analysis of sequence data (2008) Am J Hum Genet, 83 (3), pp. 311-321; Wu, M.C., Lee, S., Cai, T., Li, Y., Boehnke, M., Lin, X., Rare-variant association testing for sequencing data with the sequence kernel association test (2011) Am J Hum Genet., 89 (1), pp. 82-93; Bühlmann, P., Rütimann, P., van de Geer, S., Zhang, C.-H., Correlated variables in regression: clustering and sparse estimation (2013) J Stat Plan Inference, 143 (11), pp. 1835-1858; Shah, R.D., Samworth, R.J., Discussion of ‘correlated variables in regression: clustering and sparse estimation’ (2013) J Stat Plan Inference, 143, pp. 1866-1868; Shapiro, L., Stockman, G., (2002) Computer Vision, , Upper Saddle River, NJ, Prentice Hall","Hong, H.G.; Department of Statistics and Probability, Michigan State UniversityUnited States; email: hhong@msu.edu",,,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",,,,,15241904,,ASMBC,,"English","Appl Stochastic Models Bus Indus",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064426889

Surprising events can be avoided by methods for monitoring and analyzing these signals, continually. These methods enable the detection process of potential threats and opportunities that may arise from those surprising events. While this strategic process is very useful, conventional methods for WS monitoring and analysis do not avoid cognitive and motivational problems that can harm the competitive intelligence capacity of organizations. The solution of these problems can be related to methods that allow conducting the detection process collectively, quickly and with the least effort, through the eventual support of automatic tools. Ontologies, for example, are computational artifacts that represent organizational knowledge whose features can be used in a conceptual system for classification of WS. The purpose of this work is to present such system, which also uses Web crawling, competitive forces and PESTLE analysis in the detection of threats and opportunities. A case example also is discussed showing that this approach can be used as a viable alternative to support surveillance of strategic discontinuities that permeate the organizational environment. © 2018","Competitive intelligence; Conceptual system; Knowledge representation; Strategic discontinuities; Weak signal","conceptual framework; detection method; knowledge; signal; strategic approach; World Wide Web",,,,,"Almeida, F., Hirata, P., Entendendo e implantando um sistema de inteligência competitiva (2016) REGE - Revista de Gestão, 23 (2), pp. 111-122; Ansoff, H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H., From strategic planning to strategic management (1976), John Wiley & Sons Inc.

We tackle the problem of detecting such »forgeries» using a locally optimal detector which is well suited to detecting weak signal perturbations. We present a procedure for learning the forgery detector from a training set, using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for modeling image patches. A random ensemble of patches is used for detection of the forgery. The reliability of our forgery detector is assessed for several image classification tasks. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Deep neural networks; Autonomous systems; Gaussian Mixture Model; Locally optimum; Model images; Optimal detectors; Security risks; State-of-the-art performance; Training sets; Image classification",,,,,"Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., (2013) Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6199; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6572; Billovits, C., Eric, M., Agarwala, N., (2016) Hitting Depth: Investigating Robustness to Adversarial Examples in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, , Stanford University, Tech.

Underlying structures of a specific future scenario were revealed utilising the simplified VSTEEP. The interdisciplinary nature of the work allowed for inclusion of theories from both sociology and psychology to provide a holistic view of the evolution of consciousness. Firstly, the concept of neo-collectivist consciousness, as the next stage of human evolution, was evaluated and found to be comparable and perhaps more elegant than some established complex theories of human consciousness. Consequently, it was considered compatible with the newly developed Holarchic Evolutionary Model (HEM). As a holon, neo-collectivism not only fits into, but also validates the HEM holarchy. The characteristics of this consciousness belong to the middle - ‘green’ holon of HEM. From the macrohistory perspective this paper postulates that the current Western mindset is moving from the yellow to the green holon, with the ‘green’ neo-collectivist values already presenting as weak signals in several segments of society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Collectivism; Holarchy; Macrohistory; Neo-collectivist consciousness; Sociocultural evolution; Systems theory",,,,,,"Andersson, C., Tornberg, A., Tornberg, P., An evolutionary developmental approach to cultural evolution (2014) Current Anthropology, 55 (2), pp. 154-174; Barber, M., An hypothesis of values systems as foresight frameworks (2006) Looking up feeling good, , http://www.lookingupfeelinggood.com/uploads/Values_Systems_as_Foresight_Frameworks_2006.pdf, Accessed 29 September 2018; Barber, M., Understanding the scanning framework (2006), http://www.lufg.com.au/files/media/Understanding_the_Scanning_Framework.pdf, Accessed 20 November 2013; Barrett, R., The metrics of human consciousness (2015), Fulfilling Books London; Bauwens, M., Blueprint for P2P society: The partner state & ethical economy (2012), https://www.shareable.net/blog/blueprint-for-p2p-society-the-partner-state-ethical-economy, Accessed 15 October 2018; Beck, D., Stages of social development (2012) Spiral dynamics integral, , http://www.spiraldynamics.net/DrDonBeck/essays/stages_of_social_development.htm, Accessed 10 January 2015; Beck, D.E., Cowan, C.C., Spiral dynamics: Mastering values, leadership, and change (2006), Blackwell Publishing Malden, USA; Benson, T.W., Snee, B.J., (2015) Michael Moore and the rhetoric of documentary, , Southern Illinois University Press Carbondale; Botta, M., Evolution of the slow living concept within the models of sustainable communities (2016) Futures, 80, pp. 3-16. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328715001676, Retrieved from; Botta, M., Neo-collectivist consciousness as a driver of transformative sociocultural change (2016) Journal of Futures Studies, 21 (2), pp. 51-70. , http://jfsdigital.org/2016-2/vol-21-no-2-dec-2016/articles/neo-collectivist-consciousness-as-a-driver-of-transformative-sociocultural-change/, Accessed 29 September 2018; Botta, M., Abbasi, A., Armed conflict versus global sustainable development as functions of social change (2015) Journal of Futures Studies, 19 (4), pp. 51-72. , http://jfsdigital.org/2015-2/vol-19-no-4-june-2015/articles/armed-conflict-versus-global-sustainable-development-as-functions-of-social-change/, Accessed 29 September 2018; Boulding, E., Women's movement and social transformation (1995) The future: Images and processes, , E.

Therefore, the development of new systems to detect significant phenomena and future changes, is a key component for correct decision making that sets a correct course in the organisation. For this reason, a business intelligence architecture system is hereby proposed to allow the detection of discrete changes or weak signals in the present, indicative of more significant phenomena and transcendental changes in the future. In contrast to work currently available focusing on structured information sources, or at most with a single type of data source, the detection of these signals is here quantitatively based on heterogeneous and unstructured documents of various kinds (scientific journals, newspaper articles and social networks), to which text mining and natural language processing techniques (a multi-word expression analysis) are applied. The system has been tested to study the future of solar panels and the artificial intelligence sectors, obtaining promising results to help business experts in the recognition of new driving factors of their markets and the development of new opportunities.

We conducted systematic reviews of empirical studies comparing traditional and alternative approaches to instruction or assessment to examine the potential for compulsory schooling to be redesigned. This thorough scan of the scholarly horizon provides an opportunity to take the pulse from the literature published over the first one-eighth of the 21st century. Sixteen “weak signals” were identified from the literature that are discussed in the paper. This review might inform further research into current and future school designs and models, particularly in light of trends to personalise learning that are taking hold around the world. © 2019 The Authors","21st Century learning; Compulsory schooling; Foresight; Formative assessment; Future focused learning; Standardised assessment; Student-centred instruction; Systematic review; Teacher-centred instruction",,,,,,"Abbott, J., Overschooled but undereducated: How the crisis in education is jeopardizing our adolescents (2010), A&C Black; Adie, L., Learning as identity and practice through involvement in online moderation (2012) Educational Assessment, Evaluation and Accountability, 24 (1), pp. 43-56; Ahn, S., Ames, A.J., Myers, N.D., A review of meta-analyses in education: Methodological strengths and weaknesses (2012) Review of Educational Research, 82 (4), pp. 436-476; Ajiboye, J.O., Ajitoni, S., Effects of full and quasi-participatory learning strategies on Nigerian senior secondary students’ environmental knowledge: Implications for classroom practice (2008) International Journal of Environmental and Science Education, 3 (2), pp. 58-66; Al-Amoush, S., Usak, M., Erdogan, M., Markic, S., Eilks, I., Pre-service and in-service teachers’ beliefs about teaching and learning chemistry in Turkey (2013) European Journal of Teacher Education, 36 (4), pp. 464-479; Ampadu, E., Investigation into the teaching and learning of mathematics in junior secondary schools: The case of Ghana (2012), Anglia Ruskin University; Anderson, K.J., Science education and test-based accountability: Reviewing their relationship and exploring implications for future policy (2012) Science Education, 96 (1), pp. 104-129; Anderson, R., Chang, B., Mathematics course-taking in rural high schools (2011) Journal of Research in Rural Education, 26, pp. 1-10; Angrist, J., Pischke, J., Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricists’ companion (2009); Arthur, J., Waring, M., Coe, R., Hedges, L.V., Research methods and methodologies in education (2012), SAGE; Auerbach, S., Collier, S., Bringing high stakes from the classroom to the parent center: Lessons from an intervention program for immigrant families (2012) Teachers College Record, 114 (3), p. n3; Aydogdu, B., Selanik-Ay, T., Determination of teacher characteristics that support constructivist learning environments (2016) Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 63, pp. 293-310; Barlow, T., The end of’ chalk and talk’ (2012) Teaching Science, 58 (1), pp. 56-59; Bayirtepe, E., Tuzun, H., The effects of game-based learning environments on students’ achievement and self-efficacy in a computer course (2007) Hacettepe Universitesi Egitim Fakultesi Dergisi- Hacettepe University Journal of Education, 33, pp. 41-54; Beausaert, S.A., Segers, M., Wiltink, D.P., The influence of teachers’ teaching approaches on students’ learning approaches: The student perspective (2013) Educational Research, 55 (1), pp. 1-15; Black, P., Wiliam, D., The formative purpose: Assessment must first promote learning (2004) Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education, 103 (2), pp. 20-50; Blank, L.M., Hewson, P.W., A metacognitive learning cycle: A better warranty for student understanding?

Stagno D'Alcontres, 31, Messina, 98166, Italy","Neutron scattering applications often require discriminating the elastic contribution from the inelastic contribution. For this purpose, correlation spectroscopy offers an effective tool with both pulsed and continuous neutron sources as well as several advantages: the analysis of the neutron velocity distribution can be carried out with a duty factor of 50%, independently on the resolution value; the best statistical accuracy for spectra where the elastic part encompasses most of the integrated intensity is provided. Depending on the statistical chopper position, correlation analysis can be used for both incoming and outgoing neutron velocity determination. Moreover, the correlation technique is very profitable for investigating weak signals in the presence of high background, which is often the case for small samples. To provide instrument flexibility and versatility, an innovative approach comprising tuning resolution by variable Resolution-Elastic Neutron Scattering (RENS) is proposed, offering further benefits by enabling systematic trading of intensity for resolution and vice versa. This study puts into evidence the advantages offered by the use of statistical chopper and of correlation technique for RENS in choosing the best compromise between resolution and beam intensity. © 2019","Correlation spectroscopy; Instrumental resolution; Numerical simulation; Quasi-elastic neutron scattering; Resolution-elastic neutron scattering; Statistical chopper",,,,,,"Magazù, S., Migliardo, F., Benedetto, A., Elastic incoherent neutron scattering operating by varying instrumental energy resolution: Principle, simulations, and experiments of the Resolution Elastic Neutron Scattering (RENS) (2011) Rev Sci Instrum, 82. , 105115-1-105115-11; Magazù, S., Mamontov, E., A neutron spectrometer concept implementing RENS for studies in life sciences (2017) BBA-Gen Subj, 1861 (1), pp. 3632-3637; Magazù, S., Migliardo, F., Caccamo, M.T., Upgrading of resolution elastic neutron scattering (RENS) (2013) Adv Mater Sci Eng, 1. , 695405-1-695405-7; Migliardo, F., Angell, C.A., Magazù, S., Contrasting dynamics of fragile and non-fragile polyalcohols through the glass, and dynamical, transitions: A comparison of neutron scattering and dielectric relaxation data for sorbitol and glycerol (2017) BBA-Gen Subj, 1861 (1), pp. 3540-3545; Magazù, S., Mezei, F., Falus, P., Farago, B., Mamontov, E., Russina, M., Protein dynamics as seen by (quasi) elastic neutron scattering (2017) BBA-Gen Subj, 1861 (1), pp. 3504-3512; Hove, L., Correlations in space and time and born approximation scattering in systems of interacting particles (1954) Phys Rev, 95 (1), pp. 249-262; Mezei, F., Neutron Spin Echo: A new concept in polarized thermal neutron scattering (1972) Zeitschrift für Physik, 255, pp. 146-160; Magazù, S., Branca, C., Migliardo, F., Migliardo, P., Vorobieva, E., Wanderlingh, U., QENS study of trehalose/water/acrylamide-acrylic acid (2001) Phys B, 301 (1-2), pp. 134-137; Triolo, R., Arrighi, V., Triolo, A., Migliardo, P., Magazù, S., McClain, J.B., QENS from polymeric micelles in supercritical CO 2 (2000) AIP Conf Proc, 513 (1), pp. 234-237; Jannelli, M.P., Magazù, S., Migliardo, P., Aliotta, F., Tettamanti, E., Transport properties of liquid alcohols investigated by IQENS, NMR and DLS studies (1996) J Phys Condens Matter, 8 (43), pp. 8157-8171; Magazù, S., IQENS - Dynamic light scattering complementarity on hydrogenous systems (1996) Phys B, 226 (1-3), pp. 92-106; Magazù, S., Villari, V., Migliardo, P., Maisano, G., Telling, M.T.F., Middendorf, H.D., Quasielastic neutron scattering study on disaccharide aqueous solutions (2001) Phys B, 301, pp. 130-133; Migliardo, F., Caccamo, M.T., Magazù, S., Thermal analysis on bioprotectant disaccharides by elastic incoherent neutron scattering (2014) Food Biophys, 9 (2), pp. 99-104; Migliardo, F., Caccamo, M.T., Magazù, S., Elastic incoherent neutron scatterings wavevector and thermal analysis on glass-forming homologous disaccharides (2013) J Non-Cryst Solids, 378, pp. 144-151; Magazù, S., Migliardo, F., Vertessy, B.G., Caccamo, M.T., Investigations of homologous disaccharidesby elastic incoherent neutron scattering and wavelet multiresolution analysis (2013) Chem Phys, 424, pp. 56-61; Rosenkranz, S., Osborn, R., CORELLI: Efficient single crystal diffraction with elastic discrimination (2008) Pramana-J Phys, 7 (4), pp. 705-711; Gordon, J., Kroó, N., Orbán, G., Pál, L., Pellionisz, P., Szlávik, F., Correlation type time of-flight spectrometer with magnetically pulsed polarized neutrons (1968) Phys Lett A, 126 (3), pp. 22-23; Mezei, F., Caccamo, M.T., Migliardo, F., Magazù, S., (2016), Enhanced performance neutron scattering spectroscopy by use of correlation techniques. arXiv 1609.03287;; Pal, L., Kroo, N., Pellionisz, P., Szlavik, F., Vizi, I., , pp. 407-16. , Correlation-type time-of-flight spectrometer with magnetically chopped polarized neutron beam.

But the ML algorithm is sensitive to Doppler error and has heavy computation load, which depend on the decoding block length. In this paper, a differential detection method is proposed for data bit decoding. Differential decoding has merit of low computation complexity and fitting for long integration time. The simulation results show the robustness to Doppler error of differential decoding algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.","Bit decoding; Extended coherent integration; GNSS receiver; GPS/BDS; High sensitivity; Weak signal","Decoding; Global positioning system; Integration; Maximum likelihood estimation; Signal receivers; Coherent integration; Computation complexity; Computation loads; Differential decoding; Differential detection; GNSS receivers; High sensitivity; Weak signals; Signal processing",,,,,"DiEsposti, R., GPS prn code signal processing and receiver design for simultaneous all-in-view coherent signal acquisition and navigation solution determination (2007) Proceedings of ION NTM, , San Diego, 22-24, January; Djuknic, G.M., Richton, R.E., Geolocation and assisted GPS (2001) Computer, 34 (2), pp. 123-125; Soloviev, A., Van Grass, F., Gunawardena, S., Decoding navigation data messages from weak GPS signals (2009) IEEE Trans.

A full-frame fusion of FliF with the rotor protein FliG assembles rings in non-motile expression hosts. 3D electron microscopy reconstructions of these FliFFliG rings show three high electron-density sub-volumes. 3D-classification revealed heterogeneity of the assigned cytoplasmic volume consistent with FliG lability. We used residue coevolution to construct homodimer building blocks for ring assembly, with X-ray crystal structures from other species and injectisome analogs. The coevolution signal validates folds and, importantly, indicates strong homodimer contacts for three ring building motifs (RBMs), initially identified in injectisome structures. It also indicates that the cofolded domains of the FliG N-terminal domain (FliG_N) with embedded α-helical FliF carboxy-terminal tail homo-oligomerize. The FliG middle and C-terminal domains (FliG_MC) have a weak signal for homo-dimerization but have coevolved to conserve their stacking contact. The homodimers and their ring models fit well into the 3D reconstruction. We hypothesize that a stable FliF periplasmic hub provides a platform for FliG ring self-assembly, but the FliG_MC ring has only limited stability without the C-ring. We also present a mechanical model for torque transmission in the FliFFliG ring. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Murrell, M., Thoresen, T., Gardel, M., Reconstitution of contractile actomyosin arrays (2014) Methods in enzymology, 540, pp. 265-282;

The variety of sensory enhancement data tends to obscure the underlying rules, but it has long been clear that weak signals are usually amplified more than strong ones (the Principle of Inverse Effectiveness). Here we show that for many kinds of sensory amplification, the underlying law is simple and elegant: the amplified response is a power law of the unamplified response, with a compressive exponent that amplifies weak signals more than strong. For both psychophysics and cortical electrophysiology, for both humans and animals, and for both sensory integration and enhancement within a sense, gated power law amplification (amplification of one sense triggered by the presence of a different sensory signal) is often sufficient to explain sensory enhancement. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"article; electrophysiology; human; psychophysics",,,,,"Meredith, M.A., Stein, B.E., Interactions among converging sensory inputs in the superior colliculus (1983) Science, 221, pp. 389-391; Meredith, M.A., Stein, B.E., Visual, auditory, and somatosensory convergence on cells in superior colliculus results in multisensory integration (1986) J.

Although global positioning system (GPS) has been widely deployed in many fields, it has several disadvantages such as consuming too much power and requiring the line of sight to satellites. Cellular network-based localization is much more robust. However, this type of localization scheme cannot achieve enough accuracy for some localization-based services. With the existence of densely deployed WiFi access points, WiFi-based localization seems very promising in terms of positioning precision and power consumption. However, different than GPS and cellular network based localization, most of the existing WiFi-based localization schemes are supposed to be used in indoor environments. Note that indoor WiFi-based localization schemes cannot be simply ported to urban outdoor environments due to several factors such as weaker signal and more serious interference. In this paper, we present a hybrid outdoor localization scheme utilizing crowdsourced WiFi signal data and built-in sensors in smart phones, which can achieve high-positioning accuracy and low power consumption. Our experimental results show that the proposed hybrid localization scheme outperforms the widely-adopted GPS-based method in terms of both positioning accuracy and power consumption. In addition, the idea of crowdsourcing fingerprints is effective. © 2018, The Author(s).","Outdoor localization; Positioning accuracy; Power consumption","Electric power utilization; Global positioning system; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Hybrid localization; Indoor environment; Localization schemes; Low-power consumption; Outdoor localizations; Positioning accuracy; Positioning precision; Wi-fi access points; Indoor positioning systems",,,,,"Ibrahim, M., Youssef, M., Cellsense: A probabilistic rssi-based gsm positioning system (2010) 2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, GLOBECOM 2010, pp. 1-5. , IEEE, Miami; Ibrahim, M., Youssef, M., Cellsense: An accurate energy-efficient gsm positioning system (2012) IEEE Trans.

Human mobility adds one more layer of complexity as it has an effect on path loss depending on the activity. In this paper, we improve the quality of service (QoS) by searching for the lost nodes. Specifically, an Emergency Phase (EP) is added after RAP1 of IEEE 802.15.6-2012 superframe. The connected nodes transmit rescue beacons to reach distressed nodes, i.e. nodes that are disconnected. If a distressed node receives a rescue beacon, it participates to the current EP. The packets are buffered and relayed to the hub by the connected nodes. Our results show that when EP is enabled it is feasible to reach more nodes. © 2018 IEEE.","ban; body area networks; castalia; forwarding; mac; multi hop; omnetpp; relay; sensors; two hop; wban","IEEE Standards; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Sensors; Body Area Network; castalia; forwarding; Multihop; omnetpp; relay; two hop; wban; Quality of service",,,,,"(2012) IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks - Part 15.6: Wireless Body Area Networks, , Std., Feb; Nabi, M., Geilen, M., Basten, T., On-demand data forwarding for automatic adaptation of data propagation in wbans (2012) 2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON), pp. 326-334. , June; Latre, B., Braem, B., Moerman, I., Blondia, C., Reusens, E., Joseph, W., Demeester, P., A low-delay protocol for multihop wireless body area networks (2007) 2007 Fourth Annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking Services (MobiQuitous), pp. 1-8. , Aug; Javaid, N., Ahmad, A., Khan, Y., Khan, Z.A., Alghamdi, T.A., A relay based routing protocol for wireless in-body sensor networks (2015) Wireless Personal Communications, 80 (3), pp. 1063-1078. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11277-014-2071-x, Feb.

Unfortunately, controversies occur across many topics and domains, with great changes over time. This paper investigates neural classifiers as a more robust methodology for controversy detection in general web pages. Current models have often cast controversy detection on general web pages as Wikipedia linking, or exact lexical matching tasks. The diverse and changing nature of controversies suggest that semantic approaches are better able to detect controversy. We train neural networks that can capture semantic information from texts using weak signal data. By leveraging the semantic properties of word embeddings we robustly improve on existing controversy detection methods. To evaluate model stability over time and to unseen topics, we asses model performance under varying training conditions to test cross-temporal, cross-topic, cross-domain performance and annotator congruence. In doing so, we demonstrate that weak-signal based neural approaches are closer to human estimates of controversy and are more robust to the inherent variability of controversies. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Knowledge management; Semantic Web; Semantics; Inherent variability; Large scale conditions; Model performance; Neural classifiers; Semantic approach; Semantic information; Semantic properties; Training conditions; Websites",,,,,"Cho, K., Bengio, Y., Bahdanau, D., (2014) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, , arXiv preprint; Das, S., Lavoie, A., Magdon-Ismail, M., A Manipulation among the arbiters of collective intelligence: How Wikipedia administrators mold public opinion (2016) ACM Trans.

The simulation result suggests that the algorithm can suppress the nonlinear effect of receiver under the large interference, reduce the error rate of weak signal, and enhance sensitivity of receiver, with low complexity. © 2018 by Journal of Data Acquisition and Processing.","Adaptive correlation elimination algorithm; Blind equalization; Nonlinear; Wideband SDR",,,,,,"Xiao, H., Hong, M., Blind identification of weak nonlinear system based on normalized kurtosis (2010) 2010 International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing (CMC), 3, pp. 12-16. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Peng, J., Ma, H., Jin, J., Blind identification and digital calibration method of broadband receiver front-end nonlinearity (2011) Journal on Communications, 32 (4), pp. 119-125. , 彭隽, 马洪, 金江, 等. 宽带接收机前端非线性的盲辨识与数字后补偿方法[J]. 通信学报, 2011, 32(4): 119-125; Xiao, H., Hong, M., Juan, P., State-of-the-art in Volterra series modeling for ADC nonlinearity (2008) Second Asia International Conference on Modeling & Simulation, 2008, AICMS 08, pp. 1043-1047. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Lee, S.C., Chiu, Y., A 15-MHz bandwidth 1-0 MASH sigma delta ADC with nonlinear memory error calibration achieving 85-dBc SFDR (2014) IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 49 (3), pp. 695-707; Jin, J., Peng, J., Dynamic pre-compensation of memory nonlinear distortion for high-speed signal generator based on Volterra inverse (2010) 2010 International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing (CMC), pp. 142-146. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Liang, P., Hong, M., Blind identification and real-time calibration of memory nonlinearity based on RLS algorithm (2010) 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS), pp. 1-9. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Guo, Y., Fei, S., Wang, H., Nonlinear satellite channel blind equalization algorithm based on multi-wavelet double transformation (2016) Acta Electronica Sinica, (10), pp. 2384-2390. , 郭业才, 费赛男, 王惠. 基于多小波双变换的非线性卫星信道盲均衡算法[J]. 电子学报, 2016(10): 2384-2390; Kibangou, A.Y., Blind receivers for MISO Communication systems using a nonlinear precoder (2010) Signal Processing Conference, 2010 18th European, pp. 1140-1144. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Risuleo, R.S., Bottegal, G., Hjalmarsson, H., A new kernel-based approach to overparameterized Hammerstein system identification (2015) 2015 IEEE 54th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), pp. 115-120. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Bai, E.W., Fu, M., A blind approach to Hammerstein model identification (2002) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 50 (7), pp. 1610-1619; Zhang, T., Wang, B., Yang, B., Improved CM-based blind equalization algorithm of time-varing SIMO channel (2015) Journal of Data Acquisition and Processing, 30 (3), pp. 606-616. , 张婷, 王彬, 杨宾. 一种改进的时变SIMO信道常模盲均衡算法[J]. 数据采集与处理, 2015, 30(3): 606-616; Dogancay, K., Blind compensation of nonlinear distortion for bandlimited signals (2005) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, 52 (9), pp. 1872-1882; Duarte, L.T., Jutteny, C., Rivet, B., Source separation of baseband signals in post-nonlinear mixtures (2009) IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing, 2009, pp. 1-6. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Cheng, J.H., Lin, Y.H., Tseng, C.H., Identification of Volterra kernels for nonlinear communication systems with OFDM inputs (2014) 2nd International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI), pp. 860-865. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Tsimbinos, J., Lever, K.V., Sampling frequency requirements for identification and compensation of nonlinear systems (1994) IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP-94, pp. III/513-III/516. , [S.l.]: IEEE; Benedetto, S., Biglieri, E., Daffara, R., Modeling and performance evaluation of nonlinear satellite links-A Volterra series approach (1979) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, (4), pp. 494-507",,,,"Nanjing University of Aeronautics an Astronautics",,,,,10049037,,SCYCE,,"Chinese","Shu Ju Cai Ji Yu Chu Li",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058441653

However, basic information is often partially accessible for scientists to do research, plant data collection is one of the problems. To make plants collection become more available especially in the field environment with weak network signal, this paper proposed a novel method that combines plant recognition with distributed location information and designed a corresponding method based on Bayesian estimation to analyze plants with sick disease and unknown parts. A mobile application system has been designed and implemented which uploads plant photos to the cloud server for recognition based on the established plant library and speed up the process with the distributed location information. Meanwhile, to solve weak signal problem in the wild field, the library buffer of neighboring area where recent searching items exist are proposed in the mobile client be therefore that the application can finish matching locally and reduce the network bandwidth requirement. To illustrate the availability and practicability, different set of plants with leaves or flowers have been collected and the results show that the average recognizing accuracy via traditional method is larger than 84% and recognition time is less than 1.5 s, and the accuracy will soar to more than 90% if neural network is used. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian estimation; Cloud server; Distributed location; Plant recognition; Plant statistics","Bayesian networks; Biodiversity; Cloud computing; Data acquisition; Geographical distribution; Location; Sustainable development; Bayesian estimations; Cloud servers; Location information; Mobile applications; Network bandwidth; Plant data collection; Plant recognition; Recognition time; Plants (botany)",,,,,"http://www.imageclef.org/lifeclef/2017; Kumar, N., Belhumeur, P.N., Biswas, A., Leafsnap: a computer vision system for automatic plant species identification (2012) Proceedings of 12th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 502-516. , Andrew Fitzgibbon Svetlana Lazebnik Pietro Perona Yoichi Sato Cordelia Schmid Florence, Italy, October 7–13; Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 7573 Springer Berlin, German; Moon, T.K., The expectation-maximization algorithm (1996) IEEE Signal Process.

Lately, with consistent advancements in the Health field, mostly brought about by e-Health startups and the interdisciplinary combination of Biology, Medicine, Computer Science, and Engineering, many of the modifications seen in big screens became a reality, albeit from a weak signal point of view and not yet mainstream solutions to Health issues. Aiming to define the scope of this research, as Sci-Fi works are abundant and take the form of movies, animes, mangas, and books, filtering all of those would be a herculean job. Hence, for this paper, only movies and animes were assessed, according to precepts established in the Methodology section. Taking our society’s progress into consideration, the aims of this work are twofold: (i) knowing to what extent there has already been real scientific progress with regard to science fiction scenarios and predictions of human body transformations; (ii) understanding the repercussions of humans undergoing such modifications applied to several fields, such as Economics, Sociology and Ethics, pinpointing scenarios that should be discussed in preparation for future changes. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Cyborgs; Future wheels; Human augmentation; Science fiction; Wetware",,,,,,"America, P., Rommes, E., Obbink, H., (2004) Multi-View Variation Modeling for Scenario Analysis, pp. 44-65. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24667-1_5, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Andersen, R.A., Musallam, S., Pesaran, B., Selecting the signals for a brain– machine interface (2004) Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 14 (6), pp. 720-726. , https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CONB.2004.10.005; Astor, M., Microchip Implants for Employees?

More specifically, assuming that the marginal distribution of detail coefficients is non-Gaussian, we model it with the Student's t probability density function. Furthermore, we assume that the embedding power of the hidden information is unknown, suggesting in this way a new test statistic based on the Rao hypothesis test.

It is effective for the detection of weak signals such as breathing or motion of the human body. Therefore, a UWB radar is widely used in the field of human body target detection for earthquake and snow disasters. At present, through-wall human target detection technology using a UWB radar has two challenging problems. First, UWB radar data has a dynamic acquisition process, whereas existing detection technologies mostly employ static learning models, resulting in an inability to process and learn data features online. There is a need to address target recognition based on sensor-network data stream. Second, UWB radar faces the problem of unbalanced data classification in the identification of through-wall targets, i.e., target recognition under small-sample conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive incremental recursive least-squares regression parameter estimation method based on an adaptive variable sliding window, which performs Gaussian function fitting on the data streams and adapts to the mean square error and self-adaptation variable sliding window threshold comparison to adaptively block dynamic data streams. The tensor space theory is used to extract and fuse the multi-sensor data, and the tensor depth learning algorithm is used to improve the recognition accuracy of the target detection under small-sample conditions. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, we use three UWB radars to build a multi-state recognition system for human targets. The data stream adaptive block effect, single and multi-sensor classification effects were tested under small-sample conditions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only accurately segmented the dynamic data streams but also effectively realized multi-sensor information fusion and improved the real-time target monitoring under small-sample conditions.

Smart factories need to develop effective managerial early warning systems to identify and respond to subtle threats or opportunities, i.e. weak signals, in order to adapt to an ever-changing environment in a timely manner and thus gain or maintain a competitive advantage on the market. These factories need to develop and implement a several-stage early warning system that is specific to their industry. The aim of our study is, with the help of semi-structured group interviews, to examine which stages of a managerial early warning system are present in the case of a global innovative supplier in the automotive industry. As such, a four-stage managerial early warning system model for a knowledge-based automotive smart factory is proposed, in which aggregate activities and management decision-making strategies are defined for each stage, with the importance of intuition being taken into consideration. We found that managers rely on intuition and extensive analysis for satisficing strategies and teamwork for optimizing strategies, when using their managerial early warning system. © 2018, Editura Cefin.","Best practice;

However, it is an under-researched area within the context of smart factories. For the purpose of the study, semi-structured group interviews were used to investigate how managers at a smart factory, a highly innovative global supplier in the automotive industry sense weak signals, perceive the role of intuition, smart systems and business model adjustments. The results of the study show that managers perceive early warning systems as highly important for timely response to development changes and that both smart systems and intuition play an essential role in detecting and responding to weak signals.

To this day, many papers on this topic have been published. However, research so far has only dealt with specific aspects, but it has failed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research domain. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to organize existing insights and knowledge. The 91 relevant papers, published between 1997 and 2017, are analyzed for their distribution over time and research outlets. Classifying them by their distinct properties, we study the data sources exploited and the data mining techniques applied. We also consider eight different purposes of analysis, namely weak signals and trends concerning political, economic, social and technological factors. The results of our systematic review show that the research domain has indeed been attracting growing attention over time. Furthermore, we observe a great variety of data mining and visualization techniques, and present insights on the efficacy and effectiveness of the data mining techniques applied. Our results reveal that a stronger emphasis on search strategies, data quality and automation is required to greatly reduce the human actor bias in the early stages of the corporate foresight process, thus supporting human experts more effectively in later stages such as strategic decision making and implementation. Moreover, systems for detecting weak signals and trends need to be able to learn and accumulate knowledge over time, attaining a holistic view on weak signals and trends, and incorporating multiple source types to provide a solid foundation for strategic decision making. The findings presented in this paper point to future research opportunities, and they can help practitioners decide which sources to exploit and which data mining techniques to apply when trying to detect weak signals and trends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Big data;

One solution is semantic hashing which designs binary codes to accelerate similarity search. Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to the semantic hashing problem and produces high-quality compact binary codes compared to traditional methods. However, most state-of-the-art semantic hashing approaches require large amounts of hand-labeled training data which are often expensive and time consuming to collect. The cost of getting labeled data is the key bottleneck in deploying these hashing methods. Motivated by the recent success in machine learning that makes use of weak supervision, we employ unsupervised ranking methods such as BM25 to extract weak signals from training data. We further introduce two deep generative semantic hashing models to leverage weak signals for text hashing. The experimental results on four public datasets show that our models can generate high-quality binary codes without using hand-labeled training data and significantly outperform the competitive unsupervised semantic hashing baselines. © 2018 ACM.","Semantic hashing; Variational autoencoder; Weak supervision","Binary codes; Deep learning; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Semantics; Signal processing; Auto encoders; Critical component; Labeled training data; Large scale information retrieval; Ranking methods; Similarity search; State of the art; Weak supervision; Search engines",,,,,"Salakhutdinov, R., Hinton, G., Semantic hashing (2009) International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 50 (7), pp. 969-978; Wang, J., Liu, W., Kumar, S., Chang, S., Learning to hash for indexing big data- A survey (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE, 104 (1), pp. 34-57; Chaidaroon, S., Fang, Y., Variational deep semantic hashing for text documents (2017) SIGIR; Robertson, S., Zaragoza, H., The probabilistic relevance framework: Bm25 and beyond (2009) Foundations and TrendsR in Information Retrieval, 3 (4), pp. 333-389; Kingma, D., Welling, M., Auto-encoding variational bayes (2014) ICLR; Wang, J., Zhang, T., Song, J., Sebe, N., Tao Shen, H., A survey on learning to hash (2017) PAMI; Zhang, D., Wang, J., Cai, D., Lu, J., Self-taught hashing for fast similarity search (2010) SIGIR; Dehghani, M., Zamani, H., Severyn, A., Kamps, J., Bruce Croft, W., Neural ranking models with weak supervision (2017) SIGIR; Lv, Y., Zhai, C., A comparative study of methods for estimating query language models with pseudo feedback (2009) CIKM; Weiss, Y., Torralba, A., Fergus, R., Spectral hashing (2009) NIPS; Zhang, D., Wang, J., Cai, D., Lu, J., Laplacian co-hashing of terms and documents (2010) ECIR; Datar, M., Immorlica, N., Indyk, P., Mirrokni, V.S., Localitysensitive hashing scheme based on p-stable distributions (2004) SoCG; Liu, W., Wang, J., Ji, R., Jiang, Y., Chang, S., Supervised hashing with kernels (2012) CVPR; Wang, Q., Zhang, D., Si, L., Semantic hashing using tags and topic modeling (2013) SIGIR",,,"ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","41st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2018","8 July 2018 through 12 July 2018",,138121,,9781450356572,,,"English","Int.

In particular, intermittent connections and weak signals pose challenges for app developers. While recent network libraries have simplified network programming, much expert knowledge is still required. However, most mobile app developers are relative novices and tend to assume a reliable network connection, paying little attention to handling network errors in programming until users complain and leave bad reviews. We argue that the difficulty of avoiding such software defects can be mitigated through an annotation language that allows developers to declaratively state desired and actual properties of the application, largely without reference to fault-tolerant concepts, much less implementation. A pre-compiler can process these annotations, replacing calls to standard networking libraries with customized calls to a specialized library that enhances the reliability. This paper presents ANEL, a declarative language and middleware for Android that enables non-experts. We demonstrate the expressiveness and practicability of ANEL annotation through case studies and usability studies on real-world networked mobile apps. We also show that the ANEL middleware introduces negligible runtime performance overhead. © 2018 ACM.",,"Application programs; Libraries; Middleware; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks;

Hence, in this work, the characteristics of cyclic spectrum are studied, and an efficient weak communication signal detection method is proposed thereupon. By studying the cyclic spectrum of the communication signal, an analytical scheme determining the cyclic spectrum line of the communication signal, i.e. Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulated signal, is proposed. In order to improve the detection efficiency, a sparse vector is used to express the characteristics of the cyclic spectrum line, and a detection mechanism is established accordingly. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed method achieves higher detection accuracy without inducing more computation complexity compared to the peering cyclic spectrum detection techniques. © 2017 IEEE.","Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) signals;

Accessed 5 Aug 2017] predicted that the world would face the Fourth Industrial Revolution which means innovative changes through convergence of cutting-edge information and communications technologies (ICTs) such as artificial intelligence, IoT, big data and cloud computing with conventional industries. It was forecasted that such innovation would take place across all industries and services. In particular, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has paid attention to changes in conventional traditional industries. The weak signal analysis is a method which can detect the sign of future changes at an early stage. A weak signal is defined as an advanced indicator in such changes. Therefore, its search and monitoring can be an early warning on threat and great opportunity to be prepared. To overcome the limitation of future prediction which is mostly dependent upon an expert group's intuitive judgment, this study attempted to investigate the weak signal of convergence among industries, using knowledge structure based approaches. As new products and services can lead to convergence between industries, research data has gathered information on the products and services of global listed companies which have been established for the past 11 years. For comparative analysis, they were grouped every 5 years, and product and service trends were compared. And we detected weak signals of convergence with different industries and noticed the changes of existing industries. Historically, the convergence of industries is mainly discussed in relation to science and technology-led industries, so the industrial field that has been studied has chosen Korea's growth engine industries, a high-tech science and technology industries. © The Author(s).","Convergence trend; Global listed companies; Growth engine industry; Sharing economy; Weak signal",,,,,,"(2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/InnovationStrategy.pdf, The White House.

SRSS adds noise to a signal in order to enhance its Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and can be useful in sensing and detecting weak signals, e.g. weak Primary User or even Secondary User activity in TVWS. We demonstrate that SR is a useful Spectrum Sensing technique and can improve SNRs by ∼8-10 dB using MATLAB simulations. Typically, SRSS uses only Additive SR Noise and we include and also investigate Multiplicative SR Noise effects, showing that in certain instances the latter can also improve SNRs by ∼2 dB. We compare the Additive versus the combined Additive and Multiplicative cases using Uniform and Normal/Gaussian distributions and present our results.

In the future studies, the identification of future signal is one of the renowned techniques for analysis of trends, emerging issue, and gaining future insights. In the Big Data era, recent scholars have proposed using a text mining procedure focusing upon web data such as new social media and academic papers. However, the detection of future signals is still under a developing area of research, and there is much to improve existing methodology as well as developing theoretical foundations. The present study reviews previous literature on identifying emerging issue based on the weak signal detection approach. Then the authors proposed a revised framework that incorporate quantitative and qualitative text mining for assessing the strength of future signals. The authors applied the framework to the case study on the ethical issues of artificial intelligence (hereafter AI). From EBSCO host database, the authors collected text data covering the ethical issues in AI and conducted text mining analysis. Results reveal that emerging ethical issues can be classified as strong signal, weak signal, well-known but not so strong signal, and latent signal. The revised methodology will be able to provide insights for government and business stakeholders by identifying the future signals and their meanings in various fields. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Data-driven foresight; Ethical issue; Future signal; Text mining",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

Log-likelihood ratio (LLR) tests depend on unknown parameters, but they are needed to judge the quality of detection tests since they determine the detection regions. The popular Tukey’s higher criticism (HC) test was shown to achieve the same completely detectable region as the LLR test does for different (mainly) parametric models. We present a novel technique to prove this result for very general signal models, including even nonparametric p-value models. Moreover, we address the following questions which are still pending since the initial paper of Donoho and Jin: What happens on the border of the completely detectable region, the so-called detection boundary? Does HC keep its optimality there? In particular, we give a complete answer for the heteroscedastic normal mixture model. As a byproduct, we give some new insights about the LLR test’s behaviour on the detection boundary by discussing, among others, Pitmans’s asymptotic efficiency as an application of Le Cam’s theory. © 2018, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

In that context, it is therefore necessary to improve listening methods for “weak signals” likely to anticipate the understanding of crises. To do this, Poulain proposes the notion of “concern” to explore the sources of anxiety that lie in the shadow of the hierarchy of risks resulting from the classical approach. On one hand, the “real” risks that affect the health of populations are measurable in terms of mortality or morbidity; on the other hand, the “other” risks are more qualitative and not arbitrable by science. The use of “concerns” accepts the idea that the consumers’ gazes are not reducible to the problem of perception. It is a way to recognize that the social dimensions of risk are legitimate and to give to the eaters their “majority”. Finally, one should accept the idea that public actions aim not only to manage risk, but must also look for the conditions for trust. In this perspective, risk management is based on a tripod: risk evaluation by expertise, analysis of perceptions and consideration of “concerns” of eaters and citizens. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Louis Augustin-Jean and Jean-Pierre Poulain.",,,,,,,"Adam, B., Berkhout, F., Dyson, T., Grove-White, R., Marsden, T., O’Riordan, T., Scoones, I., Wynne, B., (1999) The Politics of GM Food: Risk, Science and Public Trust, , ESRC Global Environmental Change Programme, Special Briefing 5, Brighton, Sussex: University of Sussex; Ansoff, H.I., Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Beardsworth, A., The Management of Food Ambivalence: Erosion and Reconstruction?

To solve this task, L1 regular-ization is widely used for the pursuit of feature selection and avoiding overfitting, and yet the sparse estimation of features in L1 regularization may cause the underfitting of training data. L2 regularization is also frequently used, but it is a biased estimator. In this paper, we propose the idea that the features consist of three orthogonal parts, namely sparse strong signals, dense weak signals and random noise, in which both strong and weak signals contribute to the fitting of data. To facilitate such novel decomposition, MSplit LBI is for the first time proposed to realize feature selection and dense estimation simultaneously. We provide theoretical and simulational verification that our method exceeds L1 and L2 regularization, and extensive experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the few-shot and zero-shot learning. © Copyright 2018 by the author(s).

In practice, many tests are needed to adjust parameters to achieve the optimal effect, and this way of “trial and error” greatly limits the application prospect of FOSR. Based on genetic algorithm, a suitable adaptive function was established to adjust the multiple parameters, including the fractional order, system parameters, and the input noise intensity of the fractional bistable system. Simulation results showed that the algorithm can achieve joint optimization of these parameters. It was proved that this algorithm is conducive to the real-time adaptive adjustment of the FOSR system in practical applications and conducive to the application and extension of FOSR in weak signal detection and other fields.

Two existing tools for detecting large indels from OM data are BioNano Solve and OMSV. However, these two tools may miss indels with weak signals. We propose a local-assembly based approach, OMIndel, to detect large indels with OM data. The results of applying OMIndel to empirical data demonstrate that it is able to detect indels with weak signal. Furthermore, compared with the other two OM-based methods, OMIndel has a lower false discovery rate. We also investigated the indels that can only be detected by OM but not Illumina, PacBio or 10X, and we found that they mostly fall into two categories: complex events or indels on repetitive regions. This implies that adding the OM data to sequence-based technologies can provide significant progress towards a more complete characterization of structural variants (SVs).

Double block zero padding (DBZP) is an efficient algorithm for unaided weak signal acquisition. Considering the acquisition problem of weak direct sequence spread spectrum continuous phase modulation signal, the subblock combining and zero padding method is studied in detail. To solve the weakness of fixed number of subblock and fixed number of signal samples in each subblock given frequency resolution and Doppler searching range in DBZP, a multi block overlapping zero padding (MBOZP) algorithm is proposed, which combines with the ideas of data subblock overlapping. This algorithm optimizes the combination of data subblock by introducing the data subblock overlapping, which can increase the length of coherent accumulation and improve the performance of acquisition under the determined frequency resolution and Doppler searching range. Compared with the traditional DBZP, the simulation results show that MBOZP can obtain higher acquisition probability at small frequency offset. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.","Acquisition; Circular correlation; Continuous phase modulation; GNSS","Frequency allocation; Phase modulation; Acquisition; Acquisition probabilities; Continuous phase modulation; Direct sequence spread spectrum; Frequency offsets; Frequency resolutions; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; GNSS; Global positioning system",,,,,"Foucras, M., Julien, O., Macabiau, C., Ekambi, B., An efficient strategy for the acquisition of weak Galileo E1 OS signals (2013) ENC 2013, European Navigation Conference; Chung, C.D., Cho, S.M., Constant-envelope orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation (1999) Communications, 1999, APCC/OECC 1999, Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications and Fourth Optoelectronics and Communications Conference, 1, pp. 629-632; Beifan, Z., Research on the GPS satellite (2017) Electron.

However, features like long distance, weak signal, large unstable delay and high volume data make it increasingly difficult for traditional ways to meet the requirements of deep space communication. In order to improve the efficiency and speed of communication system, reduce the communication cost of aircrafts, accelerate the practical process of deep space optical quantum communication network, an optical quantum communication system based on the all-optical OFDM model is proposed. Meanwhile, based on the expansion in the Fock space, a well-performing algorithm of positive operator valued measurement called least square root quantum detection is presented, aiming at the non-orthogonality of the sending quantum symbol set. Also, several simulations of the system performance and possible influential factors are carried out. The results show that the proposed optical quantum OFDM system has a better performance with the usage of least square root quantum detection. In addition, some influential factors are analyzed and possible solutions are proposed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Deep space communication; OFDM; Optical quantum communication; POVM","Algebra; Information services; Optical communication; Optical fiber communication; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio communication; Communication cost; Deep space communications; Influential factors; Non-orthogonality; Positive-operator-valued measurements; POVM; Practical process; Quantum detection; Quantum communication",,,,,"An, J.P., Jin, S., Xu, J., Development and outlook of deep space communication network protocol (2016) J.

Frequency response and amplitude sensitivity experiments are all carried out to verify the characteristics of this FBG vibration sensor. By calculating the maximum Lyapunov exponent, these experiment data are analyzed. The result confirms that this FBG vibration sensor has excellent frequency response ability. When signal to noise ratio (SNR) -3.2 dB of the original signals is too small, FFT could not extract frequency information from the original signals, correctly.

Double block zero padding (DBZP) is an effective algorithm, which can search the code phase and Doppler frequency offset parallelly. However, the length of block and the number of blocks are determined by the frequency resolution and Doppler searching range, and their values are fixed, which makes its acquisition performance limited while the Doppler frequency offset is relatively small. Considering the system of direct sequence spread spectrum and shaped-offset quadrature phase-shift keying (SOQPSK) modulation in this paper, a general overlapping multi block zero padding (GOMBZP) algorithm is proposed based on the idea of data subblock overlapping. This method introduces data overlapping and optimizes the combination method of data block in order to improve the acquisition performance as well as ensure the determined frequency resolution and the search range of Doppler frequency offset. Simulation results show that under the relatively small frequency offsets, the acquisition sensitivity of GOMBZP is increased about 1dB compared with DBZP. © 2017 IEEE.","circular correlation; DSSS; SOQPSK; weak signal acquisition","Doppler effect; Quadrature phase shift keying; Spectroscopy; Acquisition performance; Direct sequence spread spectrum; Direct sequence spread spectrum communications (DSSS); DSSS; Frequency resolutions; SOQPSK; Spread spectrum signals; Weak signals; Frequency allocation",,,,,"Viterbi, A.J., CDMA: Principles of spread spectrum communication (1995) Communications Technology, 1, pp. 155-213; Jianfeng, W., Yonghui, H., Chenglin, C., Study on the serial search algorithm for GPS signal (2010) Journal of Chinese Computer Systems, 31, pp. 186-189; Beifan, Z., Research on the GPS satellite (2017) Electronic Sci., 30, pp. 30-32; Geiger, B.C., Soudan, M., Vogel, C., On the detection probability of parallel code phase search algorithms in GPS receivers (2010) IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, pp. 865-870. , IEEE; Lin, D.M., Tsui, J.B.Y., (2003) Acquisition Through Circular Correlation by Partition for GPS C/A Code and P(Y) Code, , US, US6567042; Ziedan, N.I., Garrison, J.L., Unaided acquisition of weak GPS signals using circular correlation or double-block zero padding (2004) Position Location and Navigation Symposium.

In order to improve the efficiency of the fluorescence detection system, eliminating noises from the signal is a significant step . In this paper, an adaptive step thresholding (Adaptive Step Thresholding, AST) denoising method based on wavelet analysis is proposed. According to the features of the fluorescent protein signal,noise is spread over a high frequency band of signal. The new methods is applied to the high-frequency components obtained by wavelet decomposing the signal and update threshold adaptively .

However, among the fundamental concepts of copyright, it is perhaps the least suitable for the digital environment due to its technical-functional nature. Flexible, principle-oriented regulation enabling context-sensitive outcomes and balancing of interests is needed in European copyright law. In this respect, often suggested solutions such as a fair use exception or the implied licence doctrine might not create enough adaptability; whereas, a better solution would be to reform the fundamental structures of copyright law. Even though achieving any radical changes to international conventions might not be realistic, this article attempts to find an alternative approach to the concept of reproduction. Structural rather than substantive elements as substitutes for reproduction could be derived from the context of modern trademark law. Such an approach would be consistent with the existing weak signals on convergence between the branches of industrial property law and copyright. As a structural adoption, a formulation stressing the legitimate interests behind the protection and consequences of utilisation of the protected object for these interests could be used in copyright law. One possibility would be a flexible instrument by which it would be evaluated whether the utilisation of copyrighted work affects, or is liable to affect, the legitimate interests of the right holder or alternatively if the utilisation follows honest practice in the particular sector of the creative industry. © 2017, Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, Munich.","Copyright; Fair use; Honest practice; Implied licence; Legitimate interests; Reproduction",,,,,,"Alexander, I., Determining infringement in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Britain “A ticklish job (2016) Research handbook on the history of copyright law, pp. 174-194. , Alexander I, Gomez-Arostegui HT, (eds), Edward Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham; Arezzo, E., Hyperlinks and making available right in the European Union—what future for the Internet after Svensson?

In this work, we studied the Rydberg-EIT spectra with room-temperature 87 Rb atoms. Spectroscopic data under various experimental parameters all showed that the contrast of EIT transparency as a function of the probe field intensity is initially enhanced, reaches a maximum value and then decays gradually. The contrast of spectral profile at the optimum probe field intensity is enhanced by 2-4 times as compared with that at weakest intensity. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum can potentially be improved by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. We provided a theoretical model to explain this behavior and clarified its underlying mechanism. Our work overcomes the obstacle of weak signal in the Rydberg-EIT spectrum caused by an apparent relaxation rate of the Rydberg polariton and weak coupling transition strength, and provides the useful knowledge for the Rydberg-EIT study. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"behavior; leisure; room temperature; signal noise ratio",,,,,"Saffman, M., Walker, T.G., Mølmer, K., Quantum information with Rydberg atoms (2010) Rev.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), overcoming the traditional limitation of weak signals, improves the signal intensity significantly. The preprocessing of Raman spectrum is a very useful way to reduce the irrelevant systematic variations in the spectra data while improves the accuracy of further quantitative analysis, which includes de-nosing, background correction, normalization and intensity measurement. In this paper, we first describe several commonly used processing methods, then check which processing procedure can provide the best regression analysis of peak intensity. The value of peak intensity is correspondent to the concentration of analyte. According to our experiments for the real Raman spectra data collected from detection on low concentration of Rhodamine and an unique internal standard, the procedure which combines the morphological weighted penalized least square(mpls) algorithm with maximum peak height measurement method achieves the best performance among all the studied processing methods. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cybernetics; Least squares approximations; Processing; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Regression analysis; Spectrum analysis; Background correction; Intensity measurements; Low concentrations; Material identification; Penalized least-squares; Processing procedures; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Systematic variation; Chemical analysis",,,,,"Jia, X., Li, J., Qin, T., Deng, A., Liu, W., Current views on surface enhanced raman spectroscopy in microbiology, ""sheng wu gong cheng xue bao (2015) Chinese Journal of Biotechnology, 31 (5), pp. 611-620; Li, S., Nyagilo, J.O., Dave, D.P., Gao, J., Models and methods for quantitative analysis of surface-enhanced raman spectra (2014) Biomedical and Health Informatics IEEE Journal of, 18 (2), pp. 525-536; Bell, S.E., Sirimuthu, N.M., Quantitative surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (2008) Chemical Society Reviews, 37 (5), pp. 1012-1024; Dasary, S.S., Ray, P.C., Singh, A.K., Arbneshi, T., Yu, H., Senapati, D., A surface enhanced raman scattering probe for highly selective and ultra sensitive detection of iodide in water and salt samples (2013) Analyst, 138 (4), pp. 1195-1203; Wu, X., Xu, C., Tripp, R.A., Huang, Y.-W., Zhao, Y., Detection and differentiation of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in mung bean sprouts using field deployable label-free sers devices (2013) Analyst, 138 (10), pp. 3005-3012; Roy, P.K., Huang, Y.-F., Chattopadhyay, S., Detection of melamine on fractals of unmodified gold nanoparticles by surface-enhanced raman scattering (2014) Journal of Biomedical Optics, 19 (1), p. 011002; Bocklitz, T., Walter, A., Hartmann, K., Rösch, P., Popp, J., How to pre-process raman spectra for reliable and stable models (2011) Analytica Chimica Acta, 704 (1), pp. 47-56; Zou, Y., Chen, L., Song, Z., Ding, D., Chen, Y., Xu, Y., Wang, S., Tan, W., Stable and unique graphitic raman internal standard nanocapsules for sers quantitative analysis Nano Research, , in press; Schafer, R.W., What is a savitzky-golay filter (2011) Signal Processing Magazine IEEE, 28 (4), pp. 111-117; Savitzky, A., Golay, M.J., Smoothing and differentiation of data by simplified least squares procedures (1964) Analytical Chemistry, 36 (8), pp. 1627-1639; Li, J., Choo-Smith, L., Tang, Z., Sowa, M.G., Background removal from polarized raman spectra of tooth enamel using the wavelet transform (2011) Journal of Raman Spectroscopy, 42 (4), pp. 580-585; Hu, Y., Jiang, T., Shen, A., Li, W., Wang, X., Hu, J., A background elimination method based on wavelet transform for raman spectra (2007) Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 85 (1), pp. 94-101; Chen, D., Chen, Z., Grant, E., Adaptive wavelet transform suppresses background and noise for quantitative analysis by raman spectrometry (2011) Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 400 (2), pp. 625-634; Chen, K., Wei, H., Zhang, H., Wu, T., Li, Y., A raman peak recognition method based automated fluorescence subtraction algorithm for retrieval of raman spectra of highly fluorescent samples (2015) Analytical Methods, 7 (6), pp. 2770-2778; Chen, K., Zhang, H., Wei, H., Li, Y., Improved savitzky-golaymethod-based fluorescence subtraction algorithm for rapid recovery of raman spectra (2014) Applied Optics, 53 (24), pp. 5559-5569; Li, Z., Zhan, D.J., Wang, J.J., Huang, J., Xu, Q.S., Zhang, Z.M., Zheng, Y.B., Wang, H., Morphological weighted penalized least squares for background correction (2013) Analyst, 138 (16), pp. 4483-4492; Ohaver, T., (2016) A Pragmatic Introduction to Signal Processing with Applications in Scientific Measurement, , March; Seal, H.L., (1968) The Historical Development of the Gauss Linear Model, , Yale University",,,"Dalian Maritime University;University of Jinan","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 International Conference on Information, Cybernetics, and Computational Social Systems, ICCSS 2017","24 July 2017 through 26 July 2017",,132113,,9781538632574,,,"English","ICCSS - Int.

For solving the problem, a method based on Micro-Doppler (M-D) characteristics and Duffing oscillator was proposed for vehicle classification in low SNR conditions. Firstly, the echoes model based on narrow band radar was established for two kinds of vehicles. The main difference of Micro-Doppler characteristics was analyzed for the two kinds of vehicles. Then the performance advantage for detecting weak signal of duffing oscillator system was applied in vehicles classification in low SNR conditions. The classification with high accuracy was obtained for the two kinds of vehicles. Finally, the effectiveness of the method was validated based on the measured data. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

We show that in general the SBL estimator does not recover the sparsity structure of the signal. To remedy this, we propose a hard-thresholded version of the SBL estimator that achieves, for orthogonal design matrices, the non asymptotic estimation error rate of σ√s log p/√n, where n is the sample size, p is the number of regressors, σ is the regression model standard deviation, and s is the number of non zero regression coefficients. We also establish that with high probability the estimator recovers the sparsity structure of the signal. In our simulations we found that the performance of thresholded SBL depends on the strength of the signal. With a weak signal thresholded SBL performs poorly compared to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) (Tibshirani, 1996), but outperforms lasso when the signal is strong. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Empirical Bayes inference; high-dimensional inference; linear regression; sparsity","Bayesian networks; Estimation; Linear regression; Empirical Bayes; High dimensional inference; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Linear regression models; Regression coefficient; Sparse Bayesian learning; Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL); sparsity; Regression analysis",,,,,"Balakrishnan, S., Madigan, D., Priors on the variance in sparse Bayesian learning: The demi-Bayesian lasso (2010) Frontiers of Statistical Decision Making and Bayesian Analysis: In Honor of James O.

Given the importance of weak signals in the definition of the strategy, the research goal is to treat the issue of pre-emptive strategy in the context of strategic decision making. An answer is provided for the following questions: (1) What is a weak signal? (2) How to tell if it is anticipative, relevant and useful for the decision makers? and (3) How to turn a weak signal in an effective anticipative clue?

For that reason, GPRs are used in many applications to detect and identify objects, which are hidden behind obstacles such as walls or buried under ground. In such problems, the early reflections from the wall or ground surfaces are very strong. These strong electromagnetic wave components must be removed during the 'preprocessing' phase by suitable and effective methods as they lead to detection/identification errors by masking the relatively weak signals reflected/scattered from the actual targets. The novel and effective method implemented in this work is also fast due to its low computational cost and it is used to obtain an energy based feature curve corresponding to a time signal measured by the radar. The details of feature curves around the regions with very large slopes indicate the presence and location of not only wall/ground surfaces but also buried/hidden objects with enhanced accuracy at a single computational step. In this study, we firstly simulate the GPR data for four different spherical targets of the same size, which are composed of different materials over the frequency band from 0.2 GHz to 7.5 GHz. Each sphere is placed behind the same concrete wall at the same distance, one at a time. Then, the energy based feature curves are computed for the simulated GPR data to investigate their potential benefits in the problem of through-the-wall target detection/identification. © 2017 IEEE.","cumulative energy curve; energy based features; ground penetrating radar (GPR); preprocessing; through-the-wall target detection; ultra-wideband radar signal simulation","Electromagnetic waves; Feature extraction; Frequency bands; Ground penetrating radar systems; Object detection; Radar; Radar measurement; Radar signal processing; Radar target recognition; Signal processing; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Cumulative energy; Energy-based; Ground penetrating radar (GPR); preprocessing; Through the wall; Ultra wideband radars; Signal detection",,,,,"Peters, L.P., Daniels, J.J., Young, J.D., Ground penetrating radar as a subsurface environmental sensing tool (1994) Proceedings of the IEEE, 82 (12), pp. 1802-1822. , Dec; Lopera, O., Slob, E.C., Milisavljevic, N., Lambot, S., Filtering soil surface and antenna effects from GPR data to enhance landmine detection (2007) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 45 (3), pp. 707-717. , March; Yuksel, S.E., Ramachandran, G., Gader, P., Wilson, J., Ho, D., Heo, G., Hierarchical methods for landmine detection with wideband electromagnetic induction and ground penetrating radar multi-sensor systems (2008) IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2, pp. 177-180. , 7-11 July; Dogan, M., Turhan-Sayan, G., Preprocessing of A-scan GPR data based on energy features (2016) Proc.

However, some severe limitations exist for this method. Therefore, spin states controlled by other physical field than magnetic field are valuable in the field of spintronic for both theory and application. As a popular effect, the electric field modulated magnetic moments exist in most compounds in the world. Interestingly, magnetoelectric effect provides close relationship between electric polarization and magnetization vector. Magnetoelectric effect has widely applications, including energy conversion, weak signal transmission, magnetic (electric) field detection, information storage, etc.. However, the major breakthrough would happen in the field of information storage. This paper briefly reviewed the progress in the electric-field control of spin states in recent years, such as electric-field control of magnetic anisotropy, electric-field control of interface magnetization vector, pure spin current of magnetic moment, polarization-field control of tunnel magnetoresistance, antiferromagnetic domain coupling in BiFeO3, interface magnetic disorder and orbital renormalization, etc. The modulation of spin state and transport properties vice electric field provided a route for the new magnetic random access memory, which was critical to realize low-energy information storage. Especially, the electron spin state controlled through ferroelectric field could realize a nonvolatile informational access process. Those results indicated that by electric-field control of electron spin state could provide a new route on the reading and writing process, which gave it great potential in the application of future informational storage device. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

Meanwhile, data-level information fusion methods lose physiological significance of channels. In this study, the evidence on each channel with a soft-decision method is first proposed. Then, a general multi-channel flexible information fusion detection framework for weak electrophysiological signals is established based on DSmT uncertain information fusion theory. Microvolt T wave alternans in ECG signal as an example, the proposed algorithm is verified on the simulation data and the measured data under various kinds of strong noise environments. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables robust detection of weak electrocardiogram signals under strong noise background with significantly higher detection probability in the case of low false alarm probability by comparison with the existing decision-level fusion method, applying to the weak electrophysiological signals detection for mobile monitoring environments. © 2016 IEEE.","DSmT theory; flexible fusion; information fusion detection; weak signal","Biomedical signal processing; Decision theory; Electrocardiography; Electrophysiology; Image processing; Information fusion; Decision level fusion; Detection probabilities; DSmT theory; Electrocardiogram signal; False alarm probability; Information fusion method; Uncertain informations; Weak signals; Signal detection",,,,,"Narayan, S.M., T-wave alternans and the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias (2006) J.

This method can separate the real weak signal from noise with high SNR (Signal Noise Ratio). In practical circuit achievement, the weak signal should get through a pre-process channel for filtering and amplifying before it is put into PSD. In order to eliminate DC offset voltage and current, a dynamic adjustment circuit for reducing the operator's offset is designed in the pro-process channel. The advantages and effectiveness of this method and circuit are verified by experimental testing. © 2016 IEEE.","Dynamic adjustment circuit; Phase sensitive detection; Weak capacity measurement","Dynamic adjustment; Experimental testing; Measurement methods; Measurement system; Phase sensitive detection; Process channels; Signal-noise ratio; Weak signals; Signal to noise ratio",,,,,"Al Aish, A.A., Rehman, M., Development of a capacitive mass measuring system (2009) Sensors and Actuators, 151, pp. 113-117; Jia, Y., Fu, B., Research on capacity detection circuit of capacitive sensor (2008) Sensor World, p. 3; Wang, B.L., Ji, H.F., Huang, Z.Y., A high-speed data acquisition system for ECT based on differential sampling method (2005) IEEE Sensors Journal, 5 (2), pp. 308-312; Kuhn, F.T., Van Halderen, P.A., Design of an active-differentiator based capacitance transducer for electrical capacitance tomography (1997) Meas.

This paper investigates the latter. When the environment becomes uncertain or when organizations engage in an organizational transformation, inertia or the propensity of an organization to continue its run on the same path is dangerous. Based on a survey with 108 senior managers, this paper investigates the relationships between three dynamic capabilities and Socio-Technical (ST) inertia. Results supports the general idea that the greater the capability to sense weak signals, to routinize experience of past transformations, and to reconfigure strategic resources, the lower the ST inertia. Moreover, the effect of reconfiguring is amplified with the uncertainty of the environment. Identification and understanding of particular contingencies such as firm size and industry can shed additional light on this phenomenon. © 2017 Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2017.

Utilizing a helpful, four-part structure, the authors indicate how corporate foresight is fundamental to interpret and lead change, focusing on the two cornerstones of organization and management. They advocate the separation of Research (oriented to the market of tomorrow) from Development (oriented to the market of today), the establishment of a Foresight unit and the concentration of research activities mainly on the acquisition and recombination of external know-how. After an overview of state-of-the-art literature on forecasting methods, they further propose the implementation of a “future coverage” methodology, which will enable companies to measure and verify the consistency between trends, strategic vision and offered products. These organizational and managing tools are then tested in a case study: the Italian company Eurotech SpA, a leader in the ICT sector. A useful resource for both managers and researchers, the book will help readers gain the tools necessary to tackle change and navigate complexity in organizations. © 2017 Alberto F.

The radio detection technique looks for Askaryan emission from neutrinos interacting in large volumes of glacial ice. The principle behind the phased array technique is coherent summing of the broadband, impulsive Askaryan signal from multiple antenna channels, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for triggering on weak signals. We first discuss simulations and validation measurements related to the phased array technique, including results from a preliminary Monte Carlo simulation, a demonstration of beamforming and measurements of thermal noise correlation in an anechoic chamber, and results from a trigger simulation.

The subject owes its relevance to the fact that traditional (classic) approaches to the strategic management of the operation and development of present-day enterprises within the high-tech sector are failing to align with the latest trends and cannot be used under conditions of non-linearity and stochastic changes within the framework of the current economic cycle and techno-economic paradigm. The inferences derived from this research study substantiate the advisability of using the methodological concept of foresighting for the purposes of strategic planning and managing the development of high-tech enterprises. Based on the findings of this study, the authors come to the following conclusions: foresighting is a relatively new tool for the strategic management of the innovation development of high-tech enterprises. That being said, considering that foresighting may involve the various public forces and employ the various channels for up-and-down communication between the entrepreneurial, scientific and public-governmental spheres, with decisions being focused on the long run, there is potential for a much wider scope of the search for and deployment of strategic benchmarks for the development of high-tech enterprises. The methodological concept of foresighting the innovation development of high-tech enterprises makes it possible to change the strategic adaptive approach to forecasting and planning their activity into the strategic constructive one. Sequential implementation of stages in foresighting makes it possible to determine the outline and alternative dimensions of the innovation development of high-tech enterprises through the use of special technology (horizon scanning and weak signal detection) and conduct the selection of promising projects, which, if implemented, will help achieve the goals set by the company.","Foresight project; Foresight research; Foresighting; High-tech enterprises; Innovation development; Roadmap; Strategic management; Strategy for innovation development; System of innovation management",,,,,,"Battistella, C., The organization of corporate foresight: A multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Brummer, V., Konnola, T., Salo, A., Mnogoobrazie v forsait-issledovaniyakh: Praktika otbora innovatsionnykh idei [Diversity in foresight: Insights from the fostering of innovation ideas] (2010) Foresight, 4 (4), pp. 56-68; Coates, V., Farooque, M., Klavans, R., Lapid, K., Linstone, H.A., Pistorius, C., Porter, A.L., On the future of technological forecasting (2001) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 67 (1), pp. 1-17; Cuhls, K., Johnston, R., Corporate foresight (2008) Future-oriented technology analysis: Strategic intelligence for an innovative economy, pp. 103-114. , In C.

Technology scanning is the technology intelligence sub-discipline for finding weak signals (early warning signals) to technology trends, and as we conjecture also for finding signals on technology-driven impeding changes in evaluation contexts in relevant markets. To do so, technology scanning uses a toolbox of methods including prediction, scenario analysis, and trend analysis methods. The main challenge of dealing with disruptive technologies is the lack of guidance on how organizations can incorporate disruptive technologies into their service op-erations to improve their service delivery. To address this challenge, we examine whether Information Systems (IS) research can contribute to this guidance by developing a conceptual model. The goal of our research is to design a method to formalize a conceptual model that supports organizations in incorporating dis-ruptive technologies into their service organization. In this paper, we present pre-liminary results related to requirements for identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies in a company's context. We also present an analysis of existing methods and design options (process, organizations, technology) for technology scanning regarding these requirements.","Control; Disruptive technology; Early warning signals; Morphology; Operations; Peo-ple; Precursor; Process; Service delivery; Service operations; Strategy; Technology; Technology; Technology scanning","Control; Decision making; Morphology; Processing; Societies and institutions; Technology; Disruptive technology; Early warning; Operations; Precursor; Service delivery; Service operations; Strategy; Technology scanning; Scanning",,,,,"Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Boston MA: Harvard Business School Press; Danneels, E., Disruptive Technology reconsidered: A critique and research agenda (2004) Jour-nal of Product Innovation Management, 21 (4), pp. 246-258; Paggettt, D., Mulvey, M.S., Differentiation via technology: Strategic positioning of services following the introduction of disruptive technology (2007) Journal of Retailing, 83 (4), pp. 375-391; Eckhard, L., (2002) Organisation der Technology Intelligence.

Design/methodology/approach: In the first part, upon introducing corporate foresight from the two process and content perspectives, influential elements in this construct are discussed. Then, corporate foresight’s relationship with innovation and strategic decision-making is examined and its effect on organizational performance is analyzed within a structural model. Using interview and questionnaire, the data research were collected from the banking industry of Iran including 30 banks (state-commercial banks, specialist-state banks, interest-free loan funds and private banks). Through descriptive, inferential statistical analyses and structural equation modeling using SPSS and Smart PLS software, reliability of the measurement model with 576 samples was confirmed. Findings: The results show that the corporate foresight playing three roles of initiator, strategist, and opponent affects the innovation. Moreover, the research results suggest that using the data from the foresight and identifying the weak signals, we can reduce the uncertainty and issue prior warnings in order to enhance the quality of manager’s strategic decision making and promote the organizational performance.

Our model builds on a general class of locally stationary VAR processes that evolve smoothly in time. We propose a hybridized kernel smoothing and ℓ 1 - regularized method to directly estimate the sequence of time-varying transition matrices. Under the sparsity assumption on the transition matrix, we establish the rate of convergence of the proposed estimator and show that the convergence rate depends on the smoothness of the locally stationary VAR processes only through the smoothness of the transition matrix function. In addition, for our estimator followed by thresholding, we prove that the false positive rate (type I error) and false negative rate (type II error) in the pattern recovery can asymptotically vanish in the presence of weak signals without assuming the minimum nonzero signal strength condition. Favorable finite sample performances over the ℓ 2 -penalized least-squares estimator and the unstructured maximum likelihood estimator are shown on simulated data. We also provide two real examples on estimating the dependence structures on financial stock prices and economic exchange rates datasets. © 2017, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

Both convex and nonconvex regularization methods fail to fully recover the true model whenever there exist strong columnwise correlations in design matrices or small nonzero coefficients below some threshold. To address the two challenges, we propose a procedure, Perturbed LASSO (PLA), that weakens correlations in the design matrix and strengthens signals by adding random perturbations to the design matrix. Moreover, a quantitative relationship between the selection accuracy and computing cost of PLA is derived. We theoretically prove and demonstrate using simulations that PLA substantially improves the chance of recovering weak signals and outperforms comparable methods at a limited cost of computation. © 2017, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

So, the ad hoc modes of wireless interface cards can also be used to provide device-to-device connectivity. The objective of this work is to enable toggling between the two modes (infrastructure and ad hoc) of wireless interfaces of these devices, so as to opportunistically switch between these modes depending on the availability of an access point. This provides seamless connectivity within the network, without making any changes in the existing hardware or in the protocol stack. We have developed application-level scripts to enable this mode toggling feature in WiFi equipped scenarios having less dynamism. This toggling feature can also be used to implement application-level routing between two or more ad hoc network clusters via access points, so as to provide intermittent connectivity between them. The results obtained from our experimental testbed show that our scripts work well for toggling between the two modes, and data transfer gives satisfactory performance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Ad hoc; Application-level routing; Infrastructure; Opportunistic switching; Toggling; WiFi","Ad hoc networks; Data transfer; Distributed computer systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Peer to peer networks; Standards; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Ad hoc; Application-level routing; Developed applications; Infrastructure; Intermittent connectivity; Seamless connectivity; Toggling; Wireless access points; Wireless ad hoc networks",,,,,"Nicholson, A.J., Wolchok, S., Noble, B.D., Juggler: Virtual networks for fun and profit (2010) IEEE Trans.

It is a very costly procedure and, if not conducted properly, it may lead to environmental pollution. To avoid costs associated with pumping fluid outside the perspective (gas rich) zone and improve one's knowledge about the reservoir rock, microseismic monitoring can be applied. The method involves recording seismic waves, which are induced by fractured rock, by an array of sensors distributed in a wellbore nearby or on the surface. Combining geological and geophysical knowledge of region with signal processing computer techniques, one can locate induced fractures allowing for real-time process monitoring and rock properties evaluation. In Poland perspective shell formation is located very deep, i.e. about 4km from the surface. Additionally overlaying rock formations strongly attenuate and disperse seismic waves. Therefore, signal recorded by a surface array of sensors is very weak. Signal from a seismic event can be orders of magnitude lower than noise. To recover signal connected with fractured rock one needs to use numerical methods utilizing coherence of signals. An example of such a computer procedure is presented in this paper. © 2017 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors classify wildcards into three particular types which share similar character: natural wildcards, artificial wildcards (Degree 1) and artificial wildcards (Degree 2). Wildcards point to unexpected and surprising events including important results that can form watershed in the development of a specific trend. In addition, the authors present a Fuzzy TOPSIS model which can be used in various cases to prioritize a number of weak signals and put them in order, so that the most important ones are likely to yield the wildcard in the future Findings: The authors presented a classification of wildcards with the same characteristics being natural wildcards, artificial wildcards (Degree 1) and artificial wildcards (Degree 2). The authors also prioritized the weak signals to deal with the most important ones and take appropriate action in advance so as to minimize possible damages and maximize the benefits of potential wildcards in an uncertain environment. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors report on the prioritizing of weak signals by applying Fuzzy TOPSIS and classify wildcards. This is significant because, by identifying the most important weak signals, appropriate actions can be taken in the future if necessary. The paper should be of interest to readers in the area of participatory foresight. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental scanning; Futurist; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Panel of experts; Weak signals; Wildcards",,,,,,"Ansoff, I., (1982) Strategic response to turbulent environments, , Working Paper 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, Brussels; Choo, C.W., Auster, E., Environmental scanning: acquisition and use of information by managers (1993) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 28, pp. 279-314; Coffman, B., (1997) Weak signal research, part IV: evolution and growth of the weak signal to maturity, , www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrmatur.htm; Conway, M., (2010) Environmental Scanning: What Is it, How to Do It, , April., Thinking Futures; Cornish, E., The wild cards in our future (2003) The Futurist, 37 (4), p. 18; Hiltunen, E., Was it a wild card or just our blindness to gradual change (2006) Journal of Futures Studies, 11 (2), pp. 61-74; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Hiltunen, E., (2013) Foresight and Innovation: How Companies Are Coping with the Future, , Springer, Berlin; Huang, I.B., Keisler, J., Linkov, I., Multi-criteria decision analysis in environmental sciences: ten years of applications and trends (2011) Science of the Total Environment, 409 (19), pp. 3578-3594; Hwang, C.-L., Lai, Y.J., Liu, T.Y., A new approach for multiple objective decision making (1993) Computers & Operations Research, 20 (8), pp. 889-899; Hwang, C.L., Yoon, K., (2012) Multiple Attribute Decision Making: Methods and Applications a State-of-the-Art Survey, 186. , Springer Science & Business Media; Kuo, M.S., Tzeng, G.H., Huang, W.C., Group decision-making based on concepts of ideal and anti-ideal points in a fuzzy environment (2007) Mathematical and Computer Modeling, 45 (3), pp. 324-339; Lesca, H., Lesca, N., (2013) Weak Signals for Strategic Intelligence: Anticipation Tool for Managers, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; Lesca, H., Lesca, N., The subject within the field of management science: concepts and issues (2014) Strategic Decisions and Weak Signals, pp. 1-46; Mannermaa, M., (1999) Tulevaisuuden hallinta-skenaariot strategiatyöskentelyssä, , WSOY; Mendonça, S., e Cunha, M.P., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., Wild cards, weak signals and organisational improvisation (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 201-218; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management-cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, 29 (2), pp. 15-20; Moayeri, M., Shahvarani, A., Behzadi, M.H., Hosseinzadeh-Lotfi, F., Comparison of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods for math teachers selection (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (13); Moijanen, M., Heikot Signaalit Tulevaisuudentutkimuksessa (2003) Futura, 22 (4); Molitor, G.T., Molitor forecasting model: key dimensions for plotting the’patterns of change’ (2003) Journal of Future Studies, 8 (1), pp. 61-72; Nikander, I.O., Early warnings (2002) A Phenomenon in Project Management, , Helsinki University of Technology; Petersen, J.L., (1999) Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises, , National Book Network; Rockfellow, J.D., Wild cards: preparing for ‘the big one’ (1994) The Futurist, 28 (1), p. 14; Yeh, C.H., Deng, H., Pan, H., Multi-criteria analysis for dredger dispatching under uncertainty (1999) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 50 (1), pp. 35-43; Yeh, C.H., Deng, H., Chang, Y.H., Fuzzy multicriteria analysis for performance evaluation of bus companies (2000) European Journal of Operational Research, 126 (3), pp. 459-473; Yoon, K., A reconciliation among discrete compromise solutions (1987) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 38 (3), pp. 277-286; Yoon, K.P., Hwang, C.L., (1995) Multiple Attribute Decision Making: An Introduction, 104. , Sage Publications, London; Zadeh, L.A., The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning-III (1975) Information Sciences, 9 (1), pp. 43-80; Zavadskas, E.K., Zakarevicius, A., Antucheviciene, J., Evaluation of ranking accuracy in multi-criteria decisions (2006) Informatica, 17 (4), pp. 601-618; Coffman, B.S., (1997) Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution, , www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, MG Taylor Corporation","Mohammadi, M.; Futures Studies Research Center, Imam Khomeini International UniversityIran; email: mohammadi.m.982@gmail.com",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014817004

The trends highlighted are then followed, changed, brought out, accentuated, etc. However, a recent look at mobility behaviors and how they are evolving (for example, the speed with which bicycle use has made a comeback in densely-populated cities is instructive in this regard), and at recent societal changes (particularly as regards the development of Information and Communication Technology [ICT]) suggests the need for methods that better reflect behavioral changes by being more attentive to weak signals relative to mobility. The goal of this article is to offer a prospective view for France in 2050. The analysis was funded by SNCF in preparation for the Paris Climate Conference (COP 21). Our main objective is to demonstrate and discuss an original, 4-step prospective analysis method. Phase one - the diagnostic phase - is based on a review of scientific and gray literature from the past five years and a quantitative survey of a representative sample of the population (in France). For this, we surveyed 1800 persons aged 15 and older by telephone. In phase two - the staging phase - key changes in mobility behaviors (on which the prospective scenarios were built) are highlighted. Phase three explores the various figures. Once the main lines of the scenarios have been sketched, the modal shares and associated energy consumption is determined. The objective of this prospective work is highly political, given that these figures are intended for use in planning policy that is both realistic (taking into account current infrastructure and service offerings, and their capacity for change) and readable (positioning relative current situations abroad). The fourth and final stages establish a political agenda with concrete actions for the short, medium and long term. In this article we describe the first three stages, systematically explaining our choices. We take stock of the current situation of human mobility by interpreting the latest trends described in the literature and the results of the quantitative survey. We then describe the three resulting scenarios - ultra-mobility, altermobility and proxy-mobility - explaining in detail the hypotheses upon which we built them, as well as the modal shares, traffic volumes and CO2 emissions associated with them. © 2016 The Authors.","France; mobility; prospective; scenario",,,,,,"Acket, C., Bacher, P., (2014) Diviser Par Quatre les Rejets de Co2 Dus À l'Énergie: Le Scénario Negatep; Apel, D., Pharoah, T., Transport concepts in European cities (1995) Avebury Studies in Green Research; Ascher, F., (1995) Métapolis Ou l'Avenir des Villes, , Odile Jacob Paris; Banister, D., (2005) Unsustainable Transport, , Spon Press London; Belton-Chevallier, L., Mobile ICTs as tools of intensification of travel time use?

In this paper, the authors use the multilingual analysis of Twitter to discover the “hidden cities” concealed within the city of Milan. Using the social media Twitter as a data source helps to detect weaker signals that are not captured through traditional census data. In this study, neighbourhoods in Milan are identified as areas where people speak mainly the same language on Twitter and these results are then compared with census data, to underline any parallelisms or discrepancies between the two sources of data. An added value of the paper is that the results are implemented within an online city dashboard, called Urbanscope. © Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Despite its potential, the analysis of ultrahigh-dimensional data involves fundamental challenges, wherein the deluge of a large amount of irrelevant data can easily obscure the true signals. Classical statistical methods for low to moderate-dimensional data focus on identifying strong true signals using false positive control criteria. These methods, however, have limited power for identifying weak true signals embedded in an extremely large amount of noise. This paper seeks to facilitate the detection of weak signals by introducing a new approach based on false negative instead of false positive control. As a result, a high proportion of weak signals can be retained for follow-up study. The new procedure is completely data-driven and fast in computation. We show in theory its efficiency and adaptivity to the unknown features of the data including signal intensity and sparsity. Simulation studies further evaluate the method under various model settings. We apply the new method in a real-data analysis on detecting genomic variants with varying signal intensities. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","False negative control; Multiple testing; Trichotomous analysis; Variable screening; Variable selection",,,,,,"Barber, R.F., Candès, E.J., Controlling the false discovery rate via knockoffs (2015) Ann.

The focus is how to integrate the prior information, such as the incident signal and the echo model, into the sparse dictionary (atoms). First, the highlight model of underwater echo signal is established, the relation between the echo model and incident signal is obtained, and the over complete dictionary fitting for echo signal characteristics is structured by discretizing, energy normalizing and shifting the known transmitting signal. And then, the sparse decomposition of underwater echo signal is conducted based on the matched pursuit method, and the processing results are compared and analyzed with the commonly used matched filter methods. The simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct the original echo signal, and has obvious advantage in processing underwater echo signal with ultra-low SNR. © 2016, Nanjing University of Aeronautics an Astronautics.

Due to weak signals, nuclear materials are not easily detected and numerous techniques were developed addressing issues related to illicit trafficking across the borders. In this paper, we present a numerical model for high-Z radiographic-based detection in cargo scanning for a search of hidden weak-signaling nuclear materials in assessing the effect of brightness ratios on accuracy of this method. This numerical model is attempted to present a new direction in improving the accuracy of cargo inspections by distinguishing the high-Z materials such as shielding materials (always the high-Z), or SNM, from all other materials (that could as well be in the group of high-Z) present in an examined volume of a cargo container. Gamma/X-ray radiography is widely established method to scan the interiors of cargo containers. However, processing of such radiographic images employs only 2-D radiography images. This presents a challenging limitation for an accurate discrimination between high-Z to medium-Z to low-Z materials. To address these shortcomings, we developed a new approach (demonstrated using numerical mirroring of the real scanning of cargo containers) based on two orthogonal radiography images in providing brightness and thickness of an observed volume. An empirical formula using these two variables is then derived to estimate what is a density of a scanned material in the interior of a cargo container. In addition to this empirical formula, a discrimination threshold for high-density materials is suggested in possibly providing new aspects of improvements in real scanning systems. © 2015 IEEE.","detection of high-Z materials; gamma radiography; inspection of containers; linear attenuation law; semi-empirical formula","Gamma radiography; Luminance; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Radioactive materials; Scanning; Discrimination thresholds; High-density materials; High-Z material; Linear attenuation; Radiographic images; Semi-empirical formulas; Shielding materials; Special nuclear materials; Containers",,,,,"Verbinski, V.V., Orphan, V.J., Khan, S.M., (1997) Gamma Radiography Cargo Vehicle Scanner, pp. 112-123; Priyada, P., Intercomparison of gamma scattering, gammatography, and radiography techniques for mild steel nonuniform corrosion detection (2011) Review of Scientific Instruments, 82, p. 35115; Lamarsh, J.R., Baratta, A.J., (2001) Introduction to Nuclear Engineering, , Prentice Hall; Tabata, M., Hatakeyama, Y., Adachi, I., Morita, T., Nishikawa, K., Xray radiographic technique for measuring density uniformity of silica aerogel (2013) Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 697, pp. 52-58. , 1/1; (2015) Rapiscan Auto-Z™ Detection Software, , http://www.rapiscansystems.com/en/products/cvi/rapiscan_auto_z_detection_software, Rapiscan-Systems January 14; Joel Rynes, C.P., Chinn, D., Martz, H., John Rodriguez, R.T., Technical advice and support for the cargo advanced automated radiography system (CAARS) program task 2. 2 transmission digital radiography (DR) (2011) Livermore, CA 94551 LLNLTR-473131-Final; Pelowitz, D.B., Durkee, J.W., Elson, J.S., Fensin, M.L., Hendricks, J.S., James, M.R., MCNPX 2. 7. 0 Extensions (2011) Los Alamos National Laboratory LA-UR-11-02295; Bentley, R., Database of high-Z signatures in cargo (2011) Technologies for Homeland Security (HST), 2011 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 379-383; An, J., Progress on developing 60Co container inspection systems (2003) Applied Radiation and Isotopes, 58, pp. 315-320; (1969) Radiography in Modern Industry, , Kodak-Company Eastman Kodak Co, Radiography Markets Division; Navas, K.A., Jayadevan, R., Lab primer through matlab®: Digital signal processing, digital image processing (2014) DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSOR and DIGITAL COMMUNICATION: PHI Learning; Liu, X., Shaw, C.C., Rejection and redistribution of scattered radiation in scan equalization digital radiography (SEDR): Simulation with spot images (2007) Medical Physics, 34, pp. 2718-2729; Hubbell, J.H., Seltzer, S.M., (2015) Tables of X-ray Mass Attenuation Coefficients and Mass Energy-absorption Coefficients; Tassios, T., Oeconomou, C., A contribution to the gamma radiography of reinforced concrete structures (1971) Matériaux et Construction, 4, pp. 101-106. , 1971/03/01; Knoll, G.F., (2010) Radiation Detection and Measurement, , John Wiley & Sons; Soddy, F., (2004) The Interpretation of Radium and the Structure of the Atom, , Dover Publications",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","6th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications, IISA 2015","6 July 2015 through 8 July 2015",,119186,,9781467393119,,,"English","IISA - Int.

The main idea of the application is using the smartphone connected to WiFi as a wireless mic.

In this paper, we target at inferring this particular user attribute called credit, i.e., whether a user is of the good credit class or not, from online social data. However, existing credit scoring methods, mainly relying on financial data, face severe challenges when tackling the heterogeneous social data. Moreover, social data only contains extremely weak signals about users’ credit label. To that end, we put forward a Latent User Behavior Dimension based Credit Model (LUBD-CM) to capture these small signals for personal credit profiling. LUBD-CM learns users’ hidden behavior habits and topic distributions simultaneously, and represents each user at a much finer granularity. Specifically, we take a real-world Sina Weibo dataset as the testbed for personal credit profiling evaluation. Experiments conducted on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: (1) User credit label can be predicted using LUBD-CM with a considerable performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines; (2) The latent behavior dimensions have very good interpretability in personal credit profiling. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Data mining; Risk assessment; Risk management; Social networking (online); Consumer credits; Credit risk management; Financial industry; Interpretability; Latent behaviors; Research problems; State of the art; Topic distributions; Behavioral research",,,,,"Arminger, G., Enache, D., Bonne, T., Analyzing credit risk data: A comparison of logistic discrimination, classification tree analysis, and feedforward networks (1997) Comput.

The paper presents selected issues concerning the project knowledge management, early warning systems, the concept of weak signals, as well as risk analysis. There is a need for their synthesis in order to efficiently recognize the potential opportunities and threats in the project life cycle. The proposed model of an early warning system based on knowledge integrates the elements of the theory and solutions unprecedented in project management. The basic idea is that the system should provide information concerning situations that threaten the implementation of projects, about dangerous phenomena and processes as well as the probability of their development. The system should allow rapid and flexible response to the forthcoming events, which in turn should translate into faster adaptation to adverse situations arising during the implementation of the project. It is proposed to assign prediction of threats with the identification of project risks in the form of a rule-based expert system. The capture of potential opportunities constitutes at this stage of the study only an added value and does not prejudge the functionality of the proposed system.

Activation of this sort of data and its further transformation into useful information (knowledge) allows to anticipate future environment variables and record early symptoms of potential changes in the plan of a project. The concept of weak signals is the starting point for constructing an early warning system as a tool for monitoring possible threats in a control system of production projects execution. An important element of early warning of imbalances/disruptions is a module monitoring production processes. Wear and tear diagnostics of a control system of production project execution requires a systemic approach. The purpose of this article is to present solutions dedicated for constant monitoring of machinery and equipment in a production system, as well as the flow of materials and information in processes. Therefore, a synthetic approach was proposed, based on the use of measuring systems risk analysis, and the earned value method which allows to control the project completion stages (work progress). Early identification of weak signals, their proper assessment and estimation of a forecast of future conditions require taking appropriate real-time actions. Proactive steps translate into effectiveness of production projects execution.

Genes play functional roles in the context of complex pathways. Analysis of genes as networks is therefore important to understand whole system mechanisms. Biological activities are governed by various signaling networks. The advent of high-throughput technologies has made it possible to obtain biological information on a genome-wide scale. Genetic interactions have been identified from high-throughput data such as microarray data using Bayesian networks. In this paper, we infer the disease-specific gene interaction network using a Bayesian network, which is robust to noise in the data. We apply a genetic algorithm to learn the Bayesian network. We use heterogeneous data, including microarray, protein-protein interaction (PPI), and HumanNET data to learn and score the network. We also exploit single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to infer disease-specific genetic interaction network. We included SNPs as this data may help detect weak signals related to genetic variation In this paper, we reconstruct interactions between pathway genes using our method.

However, in case of weak signals a long exhaustive search is required at the receiver for signal acquisition. A new acquisition method named Repetitive Block Acquisition (RBA) has been proposed to improve the detection performance and to speed up the acquisition process. The detection performance and computational complexity in terms FFT and IFFT operations of the proposed method is analyzed and is compared with the already existing Zero padding (ZP) and improved zero padding (IZP) methods. It is shown in this paper that the proposed acquisition method provide better detection performance when selecting long coherent lengths for signal acquisition by reducing the computional load of the receiver. © 2014 IEEE.","acquisition; block acquisition; CIA codes; circular correlation; GPS; software receiver; zero padding","Global positioning system; Mergers and acquisitions; Navigation; Satellite navigation aids; Signal analysis; Signal detection; Signal receivers; acquisition; Block acquisition; CIA codes; Software receivers; Zero padding; Signal processing",,,,,"Grewal, M.S., Weill, L.R., Andrews, A.P., (2007) Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation and Integration, , 2nd ed.

Mindfulness–mindlessness theory warns us that routine practices based on low levels of exploration and exploitation may hinder performance. Finally, the theory of learning failure distinguishes between the traps of failure or overexploration and the traps of success or overexploitation. Combining and advancing these insights, we offer a typology of incompetence traps: (a) underexploration–underexploitation or mindlessness, (b) overexploration–underexploitation, and (c) overexploitation–underexploration. We examine their manifestations in perception, cognition, and action. Based on our analysis of how incompetence traps may hamper learning in management education, we give examples of how instructors may help students achieve synergistic exploration–exploitation via informed vision (combining depth and multiple perspectives); perceptive thinking (combining theoretical, constraint-savvy knowledge and practical, context-savvy knowledge); and mindful action (developing and refining new and existing capabilities). © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","incompetence traps; informed vision; mindful action; mindfulness; mindlessness; overexploitation; overexploration; perceptive thinking; sensemaking",,,,,,"Baron, R.M., Misovich, S.J., On the relationship between social and cognitive modes of organization (1999) Dual-process theories in social psychology, pp. 586-605. , Chaiken S., Trope Y., (eds), New York, NY: Guilford,,.

It is an inevitable problem for GPS systems. And it has been one of the problems affecting the sensitivity of GPS receivers. To solve the problem, a novel auto-correlation detection method based on multi-groups data comparison (MDC) is presented. In this method, the Doppler frequency and code phase within several groups of data are compared to find the auto-correlation peak. In contrast to the mean square ratio method and peak difference method, the proposed method can improve the detection probability of weak signals effectively in the presence of cross-correlation interference. The simulation results show that in the presence of one strong signal with -124 dBm power level, the method can achieve an 83% detection probability for the weak signal with -145 dBm power level.

In order to solve this problem, an algorithm for pavement cracks detection based on Non Subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) is proposed. Firstly, the high frequency sub-band coefficients and low frequency sub-band coefficients at different scales and in different directions are obtained by image decomposition using the NSCT. Then, the adjacent sub-band coefficients subtraction to deal with the noise in high frequency sub-bandthe modulus maximum method is used to get the edge inspection of high frequency sub-band image. The Canny operator is used to proceed the edge detection of low frequency sub-band image. Finally, the low frequency image is adopted to compensate the high frequency image for obtaining the final edge image. The experimental result shows that this method has the advantages of correct edge position, complete detection and few false edge points.

GPS signal acquisition becomes a challenging problem when the signal is subject to attenuation and multipath fading. In practice, standard methods such as extending the integration time without any aiding information to increase processing gain are not always sufficient to acquire weak signals. This difficulty can be characterized by the probability of detection, false alarm and mean acquisition time. This paper exploits spatial antenna diversity to mitigate the multipath fading effect in the acquisition process. Equal gain combining of two independent antennas is considered in a standalone processing strategy. The performance is evaluated in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The theoretical analysis is compared with Monte Carlo simulations and real GPS data results. Experimental results demonstrate the improvement of detection probability and enhanced immunity against false alarms in dense multipath environments. © 2014 IEEE.","Acquisition; Detection; Diversity; Receiver Operating Characteristic","Antennas; Error detection; Errors; Global positioning system; Intelligent systems; Location based services; Monte Carlo methods; Satellite antennas; Signal analysis; Signal detection; Signal receivers; Telecommunication services; Acquisition; Dense multipath environment; Detection probabilities; Diversity; Mean acquisition time; Multipath fading effects; Probability of detection; Receiver operating characteristics; Signal processing",,,,,"Elders-Boll, H., Dettmar, U., Efficient differentially coherent code/Doppler acquisitionof weakGPS signals (2004) Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications 2004 IEEE Eighth International Symposium on, pp. 731-735. , IEEE; Sadrieh, S.N., Spatial antenna diversity performance for indoor GNSS applications (2011) Proceedings of GNSS11, , Portland, OR 20-23 Sep), The Institute of Navigation; Zaheri, M., Broumandan, A., Lachapelle, G., Comparing detection performance of polarization and spatial diversity for indoor GNSS applications (2010) Position Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS) 2010 IEEE/ION, pp. 737-744. , IEEE; Borio, D., (2008) A Statistical Theory for GNSS Signal Acquisition, , Ph.D. thesis Polytecnico di Torino NavSAS Group, Torino; Borio, D., Camoriano, L., Lo Presti, L., Impact of GPS acquisition strategy on decision probabilities (2008) Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on, 44 (3), pp. 996-1011; Corazza, G.E., On the MAX/TC criterion for code acquisition and its application to DS-SSMA systems (1996) Communications IEEE Transactions on, 44 (9), pp. 1173-1182; Kassabian, N., Lo Presti, L., Technique for MAT analysis and performance assessment of p2p acquisition engines (2012) Position Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS) IEEE/ION, pp. 980-988. , IEEE; Kassabian, N., Lo Presti, L., Mean acquisition time of GNSS peer-to-peer networks (2012) Localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS), 2012 International Conference on, , IEEE; O'driscoll, C., Murphy, C., Performance analysis of an FFT based fast acquisition GPS receiver (2005) Proceedings of the National Technical Meeting of the Institute of Navigation, pp. 1014-1025; Kay, S.M., (1998) Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing: Detection Theory; O'Driscoll, C., Petovello, M.G., Lachapelle, G., Software receiver strategies for the acquisition and re-acquisition of weak GPS signals (2008) ION National Tech.

Even though the wideband spectrum detection is feasible by combining the compressive sensing (CS) with wavelet transform, however, accurate detection of the small-scale primary users (SSPUs) such as wireless microphones and mobile devices is still difficult especially under low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) conditions due to the SSPU's weak signal strength. To cope with this challenge, we propose a novel robust compressive wideband spectrum sensing algorithm by exploiting the non-Gaussianity properties of the SSPU's spectrum. Since the spectrum of received signal at SUs more closely approximate the Gaussian distribution when the primary users (PUs) are absent than that of the PU's spectrum, it is possible to design a test statistic to measure the non-Gaussianity properties of the wideband spectrum reconstructed by CS method, then make a decision on whether there are vacant frequency bands. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm even © 2014 IEEE.","Chi-squared testing; Cognitive radio; Compressive sensing; Wideband spectrum sensing","Compressed sensing; Frequency bands; Mobile devices; Radio systems; Signal detection; Signal reconstruction; Signal to noise ratio; Statistical tests; Wavelet transforms; Chi-squared testing; Cognitive radio networks (CRNs); Compressive sensing; Dynamic spectrum access; Signal-noise ratio; Wideband spectrum detections; Wideband spectrum sensing; Wireless Microphone; Cognitive radio",,,,,"Haykin, S., Cognitive radio: Brain-empowered wireless communications (2005) IEEE J.

In its turn, the shift invariance leads to a periodic function of a real argument. This allows application of a known test for periodicity to computation of optical flow at random locations. The approach is valid also for higher dimensions: for example, it applies to a sequence of 3D tomography images. The proposed method has a reasonably high accuracy for continuous flow and is noise tolerant. Special attention is paid to weak signal input. It is shown that a drastic reduction in the signal strength worsens the accuracy of estimates insignificantly. For a possible application to tomography, this would lead to an unprecedented diminution of harmful radiation exposure.","Night vision; Optical flow; Periodicity-based processing; Preventive tomography",,,,,,"Anandan, P., A computational framework and an algorithm for the measurement of visual motion (1989) IJCV, 2 (3), pp. 283-310; Baker, S., Scharstein, D., Lewis, J.P., Roth, S., Black, M.J., Szeliski, R., A database and evaluation methodology for optical flow (2011) IJCV, 92 (1), pp. 1-31; Baker, S., Scharstein, D., Lewis, J.P., Roth, S., Black, M.J., Szeliski, R., (2013) Middlebury Open Evaluation System, , [online]; Barron, J.L., Fleet, D.J., Beauchemin, S., (1994) Performance of Optical Flow Techniques.

The main idea of our research is to identify groups of voice sequences which are typical for certain situations such as waking up from hibernation, cubs coming out for the first time from the den, a female bear teaching her cubs, cubs playing, mating and defense of territory. The communication schema of a brown bear seems to be very goaloriented and situation specific. Once we can identify context-dependent communication schemas, we will be able to better interpret bear vocalization. The bear communication ABC can be used by scientists, authorities, teachers, students, hikers and especially citizens living in bear-rich areas. For environmental conservation initiatives and programs, it is also important to interpret, early enough, weak signals coming from the bears' natural environments. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

The weak current signal of 32 PIN photodiodes' output is first amplified for about 104 times, and then sampled at 75MHz with 12bits digital precision. The weak signal modulation circuit has a good response to signal with pulse width larger than 20ns or lead edge longer than 10ns. The signal processing module receives the 32-channel signal at data-rate of 900Mbps per channel and caches them real-time inside the FPGA.

The combination of compressive sensing (CS) with wavelet edge detection makes the wideband spectrum reconstruction and detection to be feasible. The existence of small-scale primary users (SSPUs) such as wireless microphones and mobile devices, however, brings a difficulty for the wideband spectrum sensing of SUs mainly due to the SSPUs' weak signal strengths and low singal-noise-ratio (SNR) conditions. To solve this probelm, a novel robust compressive wideband spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed in this paper by exploiting the non-Gaussianity properties of the SSPUs' spectrum and utilizing the non-Gaussianity test. Since the spectrum of a SU's received signal theoretically follows different statistical distribution when the primary users (PUs) are present or not, the proposed algorithm uses the Pearson's Chi-squared test statistic to measure the non-Gaussianity properties of the compressive reconstructed wideband spectrum, then find out the vacant spectrum regions. Simulation results show that our algorithm can obtain a good wideband spectrum sensing performance even for the SSPUs under low SNRs in cognitive wireless networks. © 2014 IEEE.","Chi-squared testing; Cognitive radio; Compressive sensing; Wideband spectrum sensing","Algorithms; Balloons; Compressed sensing; Edge detection; Frequency bands; Mobile devices; Signal detection; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Signal to noise ratio; Statistical tests; Wireless networks; Chi-squared testing; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive wireless networks; Compressive sensing; Dynamic spectrum access; Statistical distribution; Wide frequency bands; Wideband spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio",,,,,"Haykin, S., Cognitive radio: Brain-empowered wireless communications (2005) IEEE J.

In the current paper, we introduce a compound decision rule to simultaneously classify signals from noise. This procedure is a Bayes rule subject to a mixture loss function. The loss function minimizes the number of false discoveries while controlling the false nondiscoveries by incorporating the signal strength information. Based on our criterion, strong signals will be penalized more heavily for nondiscovery than weak signals. In constructing this classification rule, we assume a mixture prior for the parameter which adapts to the unknown sparsity. This Bayes rule can be viewed as thresholding the ""local fdr"" (Efron, 2007) by adaptive thresholds. Both parametric and nonparametric methods will be discussed. The nonparametric procedure adapts to the unknown data structure well and outperforms the parametric one. Performance of the procedure is illustrated by various simulation studies and a real data application. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bayes classification rule; False discoveries; False nondiscoveries; High dimensional sparse inference; Nonparametric estimation",,,,,,"Brown, L.D., Admissible estimators, recurrent diffusions, and insoluble boundary value problems (1971) Ann.

The Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is applied to fit the chaos forecasting model. The synchronization between chaotic time series and chaos system is realized by combination of RBFNN and dissipative coupling. Then the synchronization error is used to detect the weak signal. The Rossler chaos system is taken as the object to test the feasibility of the proposed method and analyze its performance with weak signals of different frequencies. In order to avoid the mixed impact of noise and chaos time series to the performance of the method, the interference of noise intensity on weak signal detection is investigated in depth. Simulation results show that the proposed method can detect weak signal with different frequencies; under certain conditions, the method can detect weak periodic signal if the Signal-to-Clutter Ratio is bigger than -110 dB. The noise influence on the detection performance can be ignored if the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) ≥0 dB. On the basis of theoretical study, a new type chaotic evolution control experiment instrument MKS-CEC-III is applied to produce practical Coullet chaotic time series and add weak signals with different frequencies into time series respectively. This method is used to detect the weak signal from the mixed signal. It is demonstrated that the method can detect added frequency signal from chaotic background and it can also be applied to other chaotic systems.","Chaos; Communication; Dissipative coupling chaos synchronization; Radial basis function neural network; Weak signal detection","Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Communication; Noise pollution; Signal to noise ratio; Synchronization; Time series; Chaos synchronization; Detection performance; Forecasting modeling; Radial basis function neural networks; Signal-to-clutter ratios; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Synchronization error; Weak signal detection; Signal detection",,,,,"Holger, K., Thomas, S., (1997) Nonlinear Time Series Analysis, , London: Cambridge University Press; Matthew, B.K., Brown, R., Henry, D.I.A., Determining embedding dimension for phase-space reconstruction using a geometrical construction (1992) Physical Review A, 45 (6), pp. 3403-3411; Cao, L.Y., Practical method for determining the minimum embedding dimension of a scalar time series (1997) Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 110 (1-2), pp. 43-50; Kugiumtzis, D., State space reconstruction parameters in the analysis of chaotic time series-the role of the time window length (1996) Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 95 (1), pp. 13-28; Fraser, A.M., Swinney, H.L., Independent coordinates for strange attractors from mutual information (1986) Physical Review A, 33 (2), pp. 1134-1140; Haykin, S., Li, X.B., Detection of signals in chaos (1995) Proc of IEEE, 83 (1), pp. 95-122; Cheng, Y., Luo, P.-F., Target detection in sea clutter based on RBF neural network (2005) Radar Science and Technology, 3 (5), pp. 271-275; Hennessey, G., Leung, H., Drosopoulos, A., Sea-clutter modeling using a radial-basis-function neural network (2001) IEEE on Oceanic Engineering, 26 (3), pp. 358-372; Xing, H.-Y., Jin, T.-L., Weak signal estimation in chaotic clutter using wavelet analysis and symmetric LS-SVM regression (2010) Acta Physica Sinica, 59 (1), pp. 140-146; Zhou, C.T., Teo, K.B., Chew, L.Y., Detection of signals from noisy chaotic interference (2002) Physica Scripta, 65 (6), pp. 469-475; Kurian, A.P., Leung, H., Model based synchronization for weak signal detection (2008) IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference, pp. 1219-1222. , Vancouver Island; Kurian, A.P., Leung, H., Weak signal estimation in chaotic clutter using model-based coupled synchronization (2009) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, 56 (4), pp. 820-828; He, D., Leung, H., CFAR detection of weak target in clutter using chaos synchronization (2007) International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications, 36 (8), pp. 899-921; Pecora, L.M., Carroll, T.L., Synchronization in chaotic systems (1990) Physical Review Letters, 64 (8), pp. 821-824; Wang, M.-L., Liu, S.-W., Sun, X.-D., New frequency estimation method for sinusoidal signal submerged in complicated noise (2009) Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition), 39 (2), pp. 371-375; Sun, X.-D., Shi, Y.-W., Yu, X.-H., New frequency estimation method for sinusoidal signal submerged in strong chaotic background (2009) Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition), 39 (5), pp. 1353-1357; Parlitz, U., Estimating model parameters from time series by autosynchronization (1996) Physical Review Letters, 76 (8), pp. 1232-1235; Konnur, R., Estimation of all model parameters of chaotic systems from discrete scalar time series measurements (2005) Physics Letters A, 346 (4), pp. 275-280; Brown, R., Rulkov, N.F., Tracy, E.R., Modeling and synchronizing chaotic systems from time-series data (1994) Physical Review E, 49 (5), pp. 3784-3800; Voss, H.U., Synchronization of reconstructed dynamical systems (2003) Chaos, 13 (1), pp. 327-334; Zhang, N.-N., Zhou, S., Zhang, D.-J., Synchronization control of finite time conver-gence between two different structure chaos systems (2011) Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition), 41 (4), pp. 1131-1134; Huang, B.-X., Chaotic synchronization of Lorenz systems and secure communication (2003) Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition), 33 (3), pp. 60-63; Qin, J., Yu, H.-J., Synchronization of starnetwork of hyperchaotic Rossler systems (2007) Acta Physica Sinica, 56 (12), pp. 6828-6835; Zhu, X., Chen, Z., Gao, Z., Experimental research and verification for Coullet chaos system (2010) The Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation, pp. 3040-3044. , Yantai","Xing, H.-Y.; Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China; email: xinghy@nuist.edu.cn",,,"Editorial Board of Jilin University",,,,,16715497,,JDXGA,,"Chinese","Jilin Daxue Xuebao (Gongxueban)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904182704

In this chapter the fundamentals of absorption spectroscopy for gas sensing applications will be discussed. The focus is set on issues related to selectivity, sensitivity and stability: selectivity is important when the signal from the target gas might be affected by background contribution. Sensitivity becomes an issue for weak signals and limited averaging time. In this context, the two-sample variance is introduced as a practical method to characterize system stability and performance. © 2014 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.","Absorption spectroscopy; Detection limit; Drift; Optical fringes; System stability","Absorption spectroscopy; Laser spectroscopy; Detection limits; Drift; Field measurement; Gas sensing applications; Many instruments; Optical fringes; Practical method; Spectral detection; System stability",,,,,"Allan, D.W., Statistics of atomic frequency standards (1966) Proceedings of IEEE, 54, pp. 221-230; Andreev, S.N., Mironchuk, E.S., Nikolaev, I.V., Ochkin, V.N., Spiridonov, M.V., Tskhai, S.N., High precision measurements of the 13CO2/12CO2 isotope ratio at atmospheric pressure in human breath using a 2μm diode laser (2011) Applied Physics B, 104, pp. 73-79; Baldacchini, G., D'Amato, F., De Rosa, M., Buffa, G., Tarrini, O., Temperature dependence of self broadening of ammonia transitions in the v2 band (1995) Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, 53, pp. 671-680; Bauer, C., Sharma, A.K., Willer, U., Burgmeier, J., Braunschweig, B., Schade, W., Blaser, S., Holl, G., Potentials and limits of mid-infrared laser spectroscopy for the detection of explosives (2008) Applied Physics B, 92, pp. 327-333; Beck, M., Hofstetter, D., Aellen, T., Faist, J., Oesterle, U., Ilegems, M., Gini, E., Melchior, H., Continuous wave operation of mid-infrared semiconductor laser at room temperature (2002) Science, 295, pp. 301-305; Beer, A., Bestimmung der Absorption des rothen Lichts in farbigen Flüssigkeiten (1852) Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 86, pp. 78-88; Bell, A.G., Upon the production of sound by radiant energy (1881) Philosophical Magazine, 11, p. 510; Benedetti, R., Giulietti, K., Rosa-Clot, M., Line shape analysis of O2 in air as a way to measure temperature using a DFB-diode-laser at 761nm (1998) Optics Communications, 154, pp. 47-53; Berden, G., Peeters, R., Meijer, G., Cavity ring-down spectroscopy: Experimental schemes and applications (2000) International Reviews in Physical Chemistry, 19, pp. 565-607; Bjorklund, G.C., Frequency-modulation spectroscopy: a new method for measuring weak absorptions and dispersions (1980) Optics Letters, 5, pp. 15-17; Bomse, S., Kane, D.J., An adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm for analysis of wavelength modulation spectra (2006) Applied Physics B, 85, pp. 461-466; Brandstetter, M., Volgger, L., Genner, A., Jungbauer, C., Lendl, B., Direct determination of glucose, lactate and triglycerides in blood serum by a tunable quantum cascade laser-based mid-IR sensor (2013) Applied Physics B, 110; Budde, W., (1983) Physical Detectors of Optical Radiation, , Academic Press, Orlando, FL; Cassidy, D.T., Reid, J., Harmonic detection with tunable diode lasers-two tone modulation (1982) Applied Physics B, 29, pp. 279-285; Chao, X., Jeffries, J., Hanson, R.K., Real-time, in situ, continuous monitoring of CO in a pulverized-coal-fired power plant with a 2.3μm laser absorption sensor (2012) Applied Physics B, 110; Cooper, D.E., Warren, R.E., Frequency modulation spectroscopy with lead-salt diode lasers: a comparison of single-tone and two-tone techniques (1987) Applied Optics, 26, pp. 3726-3732; Cristescu, S.M., Persijn, S.T., te Lintel Hekkert, S., Harren, F.J.M., Laser-based systems for trace gas detection in life sciences (2008) Applied Physics B, 92, pp. 343-349; Crosson, E., A cavity ring-down analyzer for measuring atmospheric levels of methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor (2008) Applied Physics B, 92, pp. 403-408; Curl, R.F., Capasso, F., Gmachl, C., Kosterev, A.A., McManus, B., Lewicki, R., Pusharsky, M., Tittel, F.K., Quantum cascade lasers in chemical physics (2010) Chemical Physics Letters, 487, pp. 1-18; Delany, M.E., The opto accoustic effect in gases (1959) Science Progress, 47, pp. 459-467; Demtröder, W., (2010) An Introduction to Atomic-, Molecular-, and Quantum Physics, , Springer, London 2nd edn; Dereniak, E.L., Growe, D.G., (1984) Optical Radiation Detectors, , Wiley, New York; Faist, J., Capasso, F., Sivco, D.L., Sirtori, C., Hutchinson, A.L., Cho, A.Y., Quantum cascade laser (1994) Science, 264, pp. 553-555; Farooq, A., Jeffries, J.B., Hanson, R.K., CO2 concentration and temperature sensor for combustion gases using diode-laser absorption near 2.7μm (2008) Applied Physics B, 90, pp. 619-628; Fellgett, P., A props de la théorie du spectométie interférentiel (1958) Journal Physics Radiant, 19, pp. 181-187; (2011) FLAIR - Field Laser Applications in Industry and Research, , http://www.imk-ifu.fzk.de/flair/FLAIR.htm, (Online) 9 13, 2011.

Local C/A code coherent matrix is generated based on the prior information, which can speed up the acquisition. Influence of navigation data hopping is effectively reduced with the parity data. In order to reduce the amount of fast Fourier transform (FFT) calculations dramatically, the navigation data is accumulated before coherent integration. The improved half-bit weak signal acquisition algorithm improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduces the amount of acquisition computations. The experimental results show that the algorithm can acquire indoor weak signal (SNR = -44 dB) in a short time with high sensitivity, which is suitable for the GPS software receiver. © 2014 WIT Press.","Coherent accumulation; GPS receiver; Incoherent accumulation; Prior information; Weak signal acquisition","Coherent accumulation; GPS receivers; Incoherent accumulation; Prior information; Weak signals; Algorithms; Fast Fourier transforms; Information technology; Signal analysis; Signal receivers; Global positioning system",,,,,"Ziedan, N.I., (2006) GNSS Receivers For Weak Signals, , ARTECH HOUSE; Li, Y.-Y., Xu, X.-S., Liu, X.-X., Acquisition algorithm based on halfbit alternation and FFT combination for weak signals of GPS software receiver (2012) Journal of Chinese Inertial Technology, 20 (1), pp. 46-50. , in Chinese; Li, S., Yi, Q.-M., Chen, Q., Weak signal acquisition method for GPS software receiver (2012) Journal of Computer Applications, 32 (3), pp. 816-818+822. , in Chinese; Jiang, B.-X., Zhang, Z.-Z., Meng, W.-X., Whole bit acquisition algorithm in software GPS receiver in weak signal environment (2008) Journal of Electronic Technique Application, 9, pp. 99-102. , in Chinese","Department of Electronic Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China",,"WIT Transactions on Information and Communication Technologies",,"WIT Transactions on Information and Communication Technologies","7 May 2013 through 8 May 2013","Wuhan",100915,17433517,9781845648282,,,"English","WIT Trans.

To cope with the power/bandwidth constraints inherent in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), each sensor compresses its observations using a linear precoder. The compressed messages are transmitted to the fusion center (FC), where a global decision is made by resorting to a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the signal is formed if the signal is detected. We propose a sign-assisted random precoding scheme which utilizes the knowledge of the plus/minus signs of the signal components. Performance analysis shows that the signassisted scheme is more effective than the energy detector in detecting weak signals that are buried in noise. Specifically, it outperforms the energy detector when the observation signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is less than 1/(π-2). © 2013 IEEE.","Decentralized detection; error exponent; precoding design; wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Decentralized detection; Error exponent; Generalized likelihood-ratio tests; Maximum-likelihood estimate; Performance analysis; Precoding designs; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Data processing; Sensor nodes; Signal to noise ratio; Signal detection",,,,,"Reibman, A.R., Nolte, L.W., Optimal detection and performance of distributed sensor systems (1987) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, AES-23 (1), pp. 24-30. , Jan; Hoballah, I.Y., Varshney, P.K., Distributed bayesian signal detection (1989) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 35, pp. 995-1000. , Sept; Tsistsiklis, J.N., Decentralized detection (1993) Advances in Statistical Signal Processing, 2. , signal detection, H.

Although it is relatively easy to capture how each signal contributes to the relevance scores, it is more challenging to find the best way of combining these signals since they often interact with each other in a complicated way. As a result, when deriving a retrieval function from traditional retrieval models, the choice of one implementation over the others was often made based on empirical observations rather than sound theoretical derivations. In this paper, we propose a novel way of combining retrieval signals to derive robust retrieval functions. Instead of seeking an integrated way of combining these signals into a complex mathematical retrieval function, our main idea is to prioritize the retrieval signals, apply the strongest signal first to rank documents, and then iteratively use the weaker signals to break the ties of the documents with the same scores. One unique advantage of our method is that it eliminates the need of having complicated implementation of the signals and enables a simple yet elegant way of combining the multiple signals for document ranking. Empirical results show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance as the state of art retrieval functions over traditional TREC ad hoc retrieval collections, and can outperform them over TREC microblog retrieval collections.

A HEO is an orbit whose apogee does not lie below that of a geosynchronous orbit and that of all the GNSS satellites whether in services on orbits or under construction in progress around the world. So, for a HEO GNSS receiver, the antenna is oriented in the nadir direction, different from a LEO GNSS receiver in zenith direction and the weak signals may arrive non-deterministically from the opposite side of the Earth. GS-SAGA can select satellites, giving certain priorities to satellites with relatively high power levels signals and achieving the suboptimal geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). Firstly, the GNSS satellite visibility model for a HEO receiver is proposed, considering the HEO aperture angle, the HEO nadir receiving antenna pattern, the Earth tangent horizon mask, the GNSS satellite nadir transmitting antenna pattern and the signal power threshold of the HEO receiver. The visibility model defines whether a GNSS satellite is visible or not. Then, a subspace adaptive genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the satellite selection. To avoid searching the space explosively and reduce the use of onboard computer resource and time, GS-SAGA constructs a smaller searching space through setting the signal power level threshold, the GDOP threshold, the maximum number of selected satellites and giving a certain priority to GNSS satellites whose transmitting signals are received by the HEO receiver with relatively high power levels. And If the GDOP value is below the GDOP threshold, the GS-SAGA process will terminate, achieving the suboptimal GDOP within the allowable time. Simulation results shows GS-SAGA have the capabilities to estimate the satellite geometries and the signal power levels in real time, offering excellent signal power levels and GDOP values of the selection satellites. Meanwhile, GS-SAGA can decrease the number of signals used for onboard orbit determination and reduce the number of necessary capturing and tracking channels.",,"Adaptive genetic algorithms; Geometric dilution of precision; Geosynchronous orbits; Navigation satellites; Satellite selections; Satellite visibility; Signal power levels; Transmitting antenna; Directional patterns (antenna); Navigation; Orbits; Receiving antennas; Satellites; Signal receivers; Visibility; Global positioning system",,,,,"GPS.

It is very effective technique available to identify the random and abrupt faults in the input data. Spikes constrained in time domain data are spread out in frequency domain corrupting the frequency data and in some cases masking the weak signal in adjacent frequency bins. Using sliding DFT we can isolate the spike from input data or recognize the occurrence and take necessary processing precautions preventing the corrupted data to be passed on for further processing. The sudden discontinuity is identified by sudden increase in side lobe levels of the Doppler filter bank. The effect of the disturbance persists for data length of '2N -1'. But by setting appropriate thresholds it can be identified and can be isolated. In this paper we present hardware architecture to perform the sliding window DFT on FPGA. The architecture is difficult to implement using vendor supplied IP cores as they are designed to work for block input and not by sample by sample data flow. In block data flow it can be identified but cannot be resolved precisely. And since there is no provision to access the twiddle factors in IP cores which form the crux of FFT processing, SDFT realized using IP cores cannot be further optimized thus reducing its configurability. To achieve sliding DFT we have designed customized and configurable DFT block and structured the data flow using memory arrays to realize sliding window operation. © 2013 IEEE.","FFT; FIR; FPGA; IP core; SDFT; Twiddle Factors","FIR; Hardware architecture; IP core; SDFT; Sliding-window DFT; Sliding-window operations; Twiddle factor; VLSI implementation; Antenna arrays; Fast Fourier transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Filter banks; Image processing; Input output programs; Pattern recognition; Data transfer",,,,,"Cooley, J.W., Tukey, J.W., An algorithm for the machine computation of complex fourier series (1965) Math.

Activities of the studied companies are strongly determined by changes in the external economic situation. The specific features of the analyzed enterprises need to be responded by early reactions to the economic changes. The appropriate identification and interpretation of weak signals can be an important element for supporting the effective functioning of enterprises, both in the economic development and in the recession. Therefore, the authors proposed the implementation of selected early warning elements in the information system supporting knowledge management in machine-building industry enterprises.

Narrow regions, small features and low-contrast or subtle edges, in noisy images, correspond to such weak signals. In this paper, the occurrence and exploitation of stochastic resonance in the detection, extraction and analysis of such features is demonstrated both mathematically and empirically. The mathematical results are confirmed by simulation studies. Finally, results on medical ultrasound images demonstrate that several subtle features lost by the application of robust techniques such as mean shift filter are recovered by stochastic resonance.

In this paper we present a series of tests of SMS air interface delay in strong and weak signal environments. We initially establish time delay baselines for three different sizes of SMS messages. Comparing different size messages in strong and weak signal environments tells us that the time delay in a weak signal environment increases in comparison to the strong signal on average by 0.5 seconds and the standard deviation doubles. Introducing fast fading by making the sending device mobile, the average air interface delay increases slightly but the standard deviation triples compared to the stationary case. The distribution function of the time delay has thicker tails than a normal distribution and we develop a novel distribution model that provides a good fit to the empirical data and provides useful insights about system performance. © 2013 The Authors.","Cellular networks; GSM; SACCH; SDCCH; SMS","Developing countries; Exhibitions; Global system for mobile communications; Normal distribution; Statistics; Cellular network; Different sizes; Novel distribution models; SACCH; SDCCH; SMS; Standard deviation; Time sensitive applications; Time delay",,,,,"The world in 2010: Ict facts and figures (2010) International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Geneva, Switzerland, , Market Information and Statistics Division, Telecommunication Development Bureau (ITU-D); Ciubotaru-Petrescu, B., Chiciudean, D., Cioarga, R., Stanescu, D., Wireless solutions for telemetry in civil equipment and infrastructure monitoring (2006) 3rd Romanian-Hungarian Joint Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence (SACI), pp. 25-26. , May; Paulos, E., Honicky, R.J., Goodman, E., Sensing atmosphere (2007) Human-Computer Interaction Institute, p. 203; Cole-Lewis, H., Kershaw, T., Text messaging as a tool for behavior change in disease prevention and management (2010) Epidemiologic Reviews, 32 (1), pp. 56-69; (2011) Facilitating the Deployment of text-to-911 and Other Next Generation 911 Applications PS Docket No. 11-153, Framework for Next Generation 911 Deployment PS Docket No. 10-255, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking FCC 11-134, , Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Communications Commission; Peersman, G., Griffiths, P., Spear, H., Cvetkovic, S., Smythe, C., A tutorial overview of the short message service within gsm (2000) Computing & Control Engineering Journal, 11 (2), pp. 79-89; Collesei, S., Di Tria, P., Morena, G., Short message service based applications in the gsm network (1994) Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, 1994.

However the intensity of the ULF lithospheric magnetic field is very weak and often masked by much stronger ionospheric and magnetospheric signals. The study of pre-EQ magnetic activity before the occurrence of strong EQ is a very hard problem which consists of the identification and localization of weak signal sources in EQ-hazardous areas of the Earth's crust. A new approach is developed to find a source of pre-EQ ULF electromagnetic activity of lithospheric origin. For separation and localization of such sources a new polarization ellipse technique has been used to process data acquired from 3-component magnetometers. The polarization ellipse is formed by the magnetic field components at the measurement station. Calculations based on polarization ellipse parameters from two distant points allow discrimination of seismo-EM signals from natural background ULF signals. The results of experimental verification of this method in Kanto region (Japan), known as one of the most seismoactive, are given which partially confirm its efficiency and give hope, with its further improvement, to the progress in the EQ precursors reliable detection in other regions of the Globe, particularly, in Iceland known by the active seismic activity.

Some researchers are investigating the strong earthquakes precursor by variations of the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) observed with GPS signal. In addition, in the Taiwan/US joint science mission FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate), six satellites are equipped with GPS receiver for Radio Occultation (RO) experiment. This mission has successfully provided a significant amount of RO data for weather forecasting. Several such kind of GPS signal applications are developing for more accurate weather or disaster prediction, especially for weather anomaly. With the emerging of other satellite navigation system, such as Galileo, GLONASS and Compass, more GPS-like signals are available and provide more observation on the above researches. The high availability of Beidou signals in Taiwan may lead to more GNSS-based observations. Indeed, the geometric relationship between Taiwan and Beidou satellites also provides nice opportunity to observe the severe ionospheric anomaly at low latitude region. This paper describes the development of a GPS L1/Beidou B1 signals receiver. The goal is to receive signals from all satellites for RO application. As a single antenna cannot track the satellite over a wide range of azimuths, antenna array and digital beam forming approach are adopted in the GPS/Beidou receiver to cope with weak signal of low elevation or occultation environment. This multi-antenna receiver collects the signals by 4 identical multi-band GNSS antennas. The captured RF signals are downconverted and digitized to be IF signals with I/Q components. The IF signals are then weighted and summed in the digital beamforming approach according to the reception pattern control algorithm. This research employs convex optimization-based beamforming algorithm to mitigate the mismatches in the desired signal steering vector. The validation of this proposed multi-antenna receiver is conducted by receiving real GPS/Beidou signals. The discussion compares the performance of one antenna only and antenna array with beamforming to understand the benefit of the proposed approached on GPS signal and the Beidou signal. The research result can provide more opportunities on troposphere/ionosphere monitoring and provide ground based RO and weather forecast observation data.",,"Beamforming algorithms; Constellation observing system for meteorology , ionosphere , and climates; Geometric relationships; Ionosphere monitoring; Ionospheric anomalies; Ionospheric total electron content; Multi-antenna receivers; Satellite navigation systems; Algorithms; Antenna arrays; Beamforming; Convex optimization; Earth atmosphere; Ionosphere; Ionospheric measurement; Radio navigation; Research; Satellite antennas; Satellites; Signal receivers; Weather forecasting; Global positioning system",,,,,"Chen, Y.H., Juang, J.C., Lorenzo, D.S.D., Seo, J., Lo, S., Enge, P., Akos, D.M., Real-Time dual-Frequency (L1/L5) GPS/WAAS software receiver The 24th International Technical Meeting of The Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GNSS 2011), 2011; Chen, Y.H., Juang, J.C., Lorenzo, D.S.D., Seo, J., Lo, S., Enge, P., Akos, D.M., Real-time software receiver for GPS controlled reception pattern antenna array processing The 23rd International Technical Meeting of The Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GNSS 2010), 2010, , presented at the; Chen, Y.-H., (2011) Design and Implementation of Real-Time GNSS Software Receiver and Its Applications in the Presence of Interference and Ionospheric Scintillation, , Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University; Vorobyov, S.A., Gershman, A.B., Zhi-Quan, L., Robust adaptive beamforming using worst-case performance optimization: A solution to the signal mismatch problem (2003) Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 51, pp. 313-324; Gershman, A.B., Luo, Z.Q., Shahbazpanahi, S., Vorobyov, S.A., Robust adaptive beamforming using worst-case performance optimization Signals, Systems and Computers, 2003.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the practical and theoretical knowledge about EWS by providing empirical evidence from companies located in three diff erent European countries, i.e. Croatia, Austria and Greece. We propose that companies in richer countries, as measured in terms of GDP, have a higher implementation level of EWS and are more likely to meet current state-of-the-art EWS standards while companies in the countries with a lower GDP show a lesser level of development. Moreover, we explore the reasons for not implementing EWS. For our survey we used a structured questionnaire. Contrary to our hypotheses, there are no signifi cant diff erences among the countries concerning the level of EWS implementation. However, there are some diff erences as to the kind of EWS. Overall, EWS are predominately short-term oriented and operating in all three countries. The main reasons for not implementing EWS are the shortage of employees and the lack of management initiatives.","Early warning system; Empirical evidence; Operating and strategic business behavior; Trends in management",,,,,,"Aguilar, F., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York, NY; Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E.J., (1990) Implementing Strategic Management, , Prentice Hall, New York, NY; Ansoff, H.I., Managing Surprise and Discontinuity - Strategic Response to Weak Signals (1976) ZfbF, 28, pp. 129-152; Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I., (1979) Strategic Management, , Macmillan, London; Barry, D., Elmes, M., Strategy Retold: Toward a narrative View of Strategic Discourse (1997) Academy of Management Review, 22 (2), pp. 429-452; Bickhoff, N., Blatz, M., Eilenberger, G., Haghani, S., Krause, K.-J., (2004) Die Unternehmenskrise Als Chance.

Users located at macrocell edge experience relatively weaker signals from their serving Base Station (BS) and greater levels of interference from neighboring BSs. Therefore QoS provisions for such users are much harder to achieve. We propose and discuss some strategies which involve open access femtocell deployment to aid the macrocell edge users in achieving their performance objectives. These femtocells can be deployed in various configurations near the macrocell edge. The macrocell edge users can then communicate through the nearby femtocell. We also discuss the situation when BS and femtocell cooperatively communicate with the macrocell edge user. We investigate the performance of these deployment strategies through simulations. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Cellular network; Deployment strategy; Femtocells; Macro cells; Open Access; Performance objective; Quality of service; Femtocell",,,,,"Fodor, G., Koutsimanis, C., Racz, A., Reider, N., Simonsson, A., Muller, W., Intercell Interference Coordination in OFDMA Networks and in the 3GPP Long Term Evolution System (2009) Journal of Communications, 4 (7), pp. 445-453. , Aug. 2009; Andrews, J.G., Interference Cancellation for Cellular Systems: A Contemporary Overview (2005) IEEE Wireless Communications, 12 (2), pp. 19-29. , April; Rappaport, T.S., (2002) Wireless Communications Principles and Practice, , Prentice Hall; (2010) Overview of 3GPP Release 8, , V0.1.1 06; Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Gatherer, A., Femtocell networks: A survey (2008) IEEE Communications Magazine, 46 (9), pp. 59-67. , Sep; Boccuzzi, J., Ruggiero Femtocells, M., (2011) Design and Application, , McGraw- Hill Publication; Zhang, J., Roche, G., (2010) Femtocells: Technologies, , John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., Publication; Ali-Yahiya, T., LTE and Femtocell (2011) Understanding LTE and Its Performance, (PART 2), pp. 127-143. , Chapter 8; Jo, H., Xia, P., Andrews, J.G., Open, Closed and Shared Access Femtocells in the Downlink, , arXiv:1009.3522v1; Guvenc, I., Jeong, M., Watanabe, F., Inamura, H., A Hybrid Frequency Assignment for Femtocells and Coverage Area Analysis for Co-Channel Operation (2008) IEEE Communication Letters, 12 (12), pp. 880-882. , Dec; Claussen, H., Performance of Macro- and Co-Channel Femtocells in a Hierarchical Cell Structure (2007) Proc.

The structure of the locally optimum Bayes detector (LOBD) is derived and consists of a zero-memory nonlinearity (ZMNL), a function of first-order noise density, followed by the non-coherent Gaussian envelope detector for MCSS signals. The performance of this receiver has been evaluated and closed-form expressions for symbol error rate (SER) and bit error rate (BER) have been derived. It has been shown that the SER and BER performances are functions of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the sample size per symbol interval, the input data size, and the modulation parameters of MCSS signals.

With the change of the size, location and output signal of the goal in four quadrant detector, the linear probe interval is determined in the four quadrant detector. In this interval, a liner relation can be get between the spot position and the corresponding output signal. The target quick location is realized with this relation.

The opportunities for gaining practical experience in the field however are limited by cost considerations and practicability. These limitations are exacerbated by the fact that field data can differ significantly from data generated in the laboratory. As a means of exercising existing emergency measuring/surveying capability and introducing car-borne measurements to a larger group, a virtual exercise was devised. The exercise ORPEX (Orphan Sources and Fresh Fallout Virtual Exercise in Mobile Measurement) featured two typical emergency scenarios: a search for orphan sources and surveying to delineate fallout from a local release point. Synthetic spectral data were generated for point sources and inserted into genuine car-borne measurement data. Participants were presented with a typical software tool and data and were asked to report source locations and isotopes within a time limit. In the second scenario, synthetic data representing fallout from a local fire involving radioactive material were added to real car-borne data, participants being asked to produce maps identifying and characterising the regions of contamination. Fourteen individual organisations from seven different countries supplied results which indicated that for strong sources of isotopes with simple spectra featuring high energy peaks, location and identification was not a problem. Problems arose for isotopes with low energy signals or that presented a weak signal even when visible for extended periods. Experienced analysts tended to perform better in identification of sources irrespective of experience with mobile measurements whereas those with experience in such measurements were more confident in providing more precise estimates of location. The results indicated the need for the inclusion of less frequently encountered sources in field exercise related to mobile measurements. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Deposition; Gamma; Mobile; Orphan; Spectrometry; Synthetic","Emergency response; Emergency scenario; Field data; Gamma; Gamma spectrometry; High energy; Identification of sources; In-field; Low energies; Measurement data; Mobile; Orphan; Orphan sources; Point sources; Practical experience; Software tool; Source location; Spectral data; Synthetic; Synthetic data; Weak signals; Deposition; Fallout; Gamma ray spectrometers; Isotopes; Radioactive materials; Spectrometry; Surveying; Accidents; radioactive material; automobile; data acquisition; deposition; experimental study; fallout; gamma ray spectrometry; geological survey; point source; pollutant source; radioactive waste; radionuclide; software; surveying; virtual reality; article; exercise; gamma spectrometry; radiation exposure; radiation measurement; radiation protection; radioactive contamination; steady state; Radiation Monitoring; Spectrometry, Gamma",,,,,"Aage, H.K., Korsbech, U., Bargholz, K., Bystöm, S., Wedmark, M., Thorshaug, S., Experiences with area specific spectrum stripping of NaI (Tl) gamma spectra (2006) Radiat.

But most of researches and applications are just in data numerical simulations. This paper gives a statistically theoretical investigation according to noise equivalent transformation and experimental simulation for this very important weak signal detection technique. Then this immunity to noise of Duffing oscillator is applied in weak UWB signal detection. The theoretical analysis and data simulation results show that Duffing oscillator is immune to the white noise in statistical sense. Furthermore, the applications in weak UWB signal detection also demonstrate that the immunity to noise of Duffing oscillator is effective in detecting the weak received UWB information of long distance. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Duffing oscillator; Noise immunity; UWB (Ultra-Wide Band); Weak signal detection","Academic research; Data simulation; Duffing oscillator; Equivalent transformations; Experimental simulations; Noise immunity; Theoretical investigations; Weak signal detection; Signal detection; White noise; Oscillators (mechanical)",,,,,"Wei, X., Randrianandrasana, M.F., Ward, M., Lowe, D., Nonlinear Dynamics of a Periodically Driven Duffing Resonator Coupled to a Van der Pol Oscillator (2011) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2011, pp. 1-16; Li, Y., Zhang, T., On the Existence of Solutions for Impulsive Duffing Dynamic Equations on Time Scales with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions (2010) Abstract and Applied Analysis, 2010, pp. 1-27; Ting, Z., Wenhua, H., The Existence and Uniqueness of Solution of Duffing Equations with Non-C2 Perturbation Functional at Nonresonance (2008) Boundary Value Problems, 2008, pp. 1-9; Su, L., Prediction of multivariate chaotic time series with local polynomial fitting (2010) Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 59, pp. 737-744. , January; Su, L., Liu, R., Li, F., Li, J., Prediction comparative study of complex multivariate systems with AGA-BP (2010) Proceedings of 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling, 10, pp. 50-54. , October; Wang, J., Zhou, J., Peng, B., Weak signal detection method based on Duffing oscillator (2009) Kybernetes, 38, pp. 1662-1668; Huang, P., Pi, Y., Zhao, Z., Weak GPS Signal Acquisition Algorithm Based on Chaotic Oscillator (2009) EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing, 2009, pp. 1-6; Song, W., Deng, S., Yang, J., Cheng, Q., Tool Wear Detection Based on Duffing-Holmes Oscillator (2008) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2008, pp. 1-15; Hu, N.Q., Wen, X.S., The application of Duffing oscillator in characteristic signal detection of early fault (2003) Journal of Sound and Vibration, 268, pp. 917-931; Su, L., Ma, H., Tang, S., Weak signal detection in strong chaotic background with chaotic oscillator and neural network (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 Chinese Control and Decision conference, 1, pp. 259-264; Su, L., Ma, H., Tang, S., Weak Signal Detection of Strong Fractional Noise Using Chaos Oscillator and Kalman Filtering (2007) Journal of Sichuan University (Engineering Science Edition), 39, pp. 149-154; Ariaratnam, S.T., Xie, W.C., Vrscay, E.R., Chaotic motion under parametric excitation (1989) Dynamics and Stability of Systems, 4, pp. 111-130; Gandino, E., Marchesiello, S., Identification of a Duffing Oscillator under Different Types of Excitation (2010) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2010, pp. 1-15; Awrejcewicz, J., Holicke, M., Analytical prediction of stick-slip chaos in a double self-excited Duffing-type oscillator (2006) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2006, pp. 1-9; Xie, W.C., Effect of noise on chaotic motion of buckled column under periodic excitation (1994) Nonlinear and Stochastic Dynamics, 78, pp. 215-225; Lin, H., Yim, S.C., Analysis of a nonlinear system exhibiting chaotic, noisy chaotic, and random behaviors (1996) Journal of Applied Mechanics, 63, pp. 509-516; Liu, W., Zhu, W., Huang, Z., Xiao, Z., Chaotic motion of Duffing oscillator under parametric excitation of bounded noise (2002) Engineering Mechanics, 16, pp. 133-136; Liu, W.Y., Zhu, W.Q., Huang, Z.L., Effect of bounded noise on chaotic Duffing oscillator under parametric excitation (2001) Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 12, pp. 527-537; Su, L., Li, J., Blind Multiuser Detector of THUWB with HMM and DLMS (2009) 2009 International congress on image and signal processing, 1, pp. 3779-3783; Fenglan, S.L.-L., Jiaojun, L., Bo, C., A Novel Digital Image Covert Communication Scheme based on Generalized FCM in DCT Domain (2011) Fuzzy Information and Engineering, 3, pp. 127-136; Jian, P., Liyun, S., Performance analysis of blind multiuser detector with fuzzy kalman filter in IR-UWB (2009) International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 5, pp. 47-48; Jiaojun, L., Bing, C., Heng, L., Liyun, S., An Adaptive Power Minimization Algorithm for Powerline Communication (2010) 2010 2nd International Conference on Computer Modeling and Simulation, 1, pp. 300-302","Su, L.; School of Mathematics and Statistics, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing 400054China; email: cloudhopping@sohu.com",,,,,,,,17962056,,,,"English","J.

There is no significant design or method for understanding ""animal behaviour for earthquake prediction"", though international researches have been carried out especially in China, Japan and USA. These researches mainly rely on particular animal behaviour changes due to several simulated earthquake environment and based on previous earthquake statistics. However, animal produces numeral behaviours, and it is ambiguous to rely on particular behaviour rather than elaborate system. This paper aims to describe the circular model of energy flow during earthquake, similar to a damping oscillator. The energy flow is compared to a power inverse law. The energy spread at long distances are linked to animal sensitivity level. Animal signals are produced in the form of acoustic, chemical, electromagnetic signals. These signals are important in applying for recognition of nearby calamities such as earthquake. Then methods of data collection for such parameters are emphasized along with the reason for targeting a group of species as reference - rather than many. Animals are sensitive to weak signals which are often unnoticed even by the subtle instruments and measuring techniques. So a method for earthquake prediction based on signal variations in nature and animal responses is proposed. The explicit reason for animal based prediction model is explained in terms of biological and physical factors. The data collection and processing method is an integrated model of different types of signal analysing techniques. An integrated processing method increases efficiency of the system through comparison and mathematical analysis. Animals react to environmental changes and their reaction accompanies different behaviour changes. This response to stimuli involves pheromone secretions and homoeostasis rate variations. An earthquake induces such changes to highly sensitive species. An integrated analyser can be used to detect pheromone level along with other environmental variations to forecast a nearby disaster. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

By analyzing the structure characteristics of the two dimensional spread spectrum sequence, the redundant operations hidden in traditional time correlation method were found. Then, a novel two-stage acquisition method is proposed, aiming mainly at removing the reduplicate multiply operations in the correlation processing. In this two-stage method, the former stage performs some data rearranging operations, on the basis of the estimate values of the initial phases of the two spreading codes. Then in the latter stage, the rearranged data is time correlated with the local version of the first code, and the result is used to verify whether the estimate is right. The data rearranging breaks through the coherent integration length limit in the serial search acquisition. So the proposed method can achieve much higher acquisition sensitivity than the serial search based and is more suitable for weak signals acquisition. Actually, since the data rearranging only adjusts the computation flow and no information will be lost, the proposed method has the same performance as the traditional time correlation. Benefited from the data rearranging, however, many multiply operations in the correlation processing can be combined. Then the computational complexity is reduced dramatically, and the acquisition can be accomplished very efficiently. At the end of this paper, numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Coherent integration; Computation flow; Correlation processing; First code; Initial phasis; Local versions; Numerical example; Search-based; Spreading codes; Structure characteristic; Time correlations; Two dimensional spread spectrum; Two stage; Two-stage methods; Weak signals; Codes (symbols); Computational complexity; Signal processing; Spectroscopy; Numerical methods",,,,,"Hara, S., Prasad, R., Overview of multicarrier CDMA (1997) IEEE Communication Magazine, 32 (12), pp. 126-133; Cheng, L., Tang, Y., Li, S., A timing acquisition method for two-dimensional spread spectrum system in multipath fading channels (2005) 2005 International Conf. on Communications, Circuits and Systems, 1, pp. 454-457. , Aug; Song, L., Tang, Y., Li, S., Performance of time and frequency domain chip-level differential detection in two-dimension spread spectrum system (2005) 2005 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2005), 4, pp. 2457-2461. , May; Shao, S.-H., Tang, Y.-X., Pan, W.-S., Performance of M-ary two-imensional spread spectrum in Rayleigh fading channels (2006) Acta Electronica Sina, 34 (1), pp. 99-102; Tang, Y.-X., Li, S.-Q., The performance of generalized time-frequency domain two dimensional spread spectrum in AWGN channel (2004) Journal of Electronics & Information Technology, 26 (2), pp. 248-253. , Feb; Tang, Y.-X., Shao, S.-H., Pan, W.-S., Improved non-Rake receiver based on two dimensional spread spectrum for WCDMA systems (2006) Journal on Communication, 26 (11), pp. 93-99. , Nov; Bai, Y., Liang, J., Zhang, Q., UAV control link antifading technology research based on two-dimensional spread spectrum (2010) Space Electronic Technology, (1), pp. 42-45; Kim, J.H., Kim, S.W., Partial successive interference cancellation in hybrid DS/FH spread spectrum multiple-access systems (2001) IEEE Trans.on Communication, 49 (10), pp. 1710-1714; Song, P., Research on PSK-2DSS technology (2010) Science and Technology Innovation Herald, (34), pp. 3-4; Chen, H.-Z., Tian, H.-X., Yi, K.-C., Implementation of frame synchronization picking-up of a PSK-2DSS system on FPGA (2004) Communication and Computer, (1), pp. 40-42; Zhao, W.-P., (2009) Design and Anti-jamming Capability Analysis of A Two Dimensional Spread Spectrum System, , Master Dissertation, XIDIAN University","Lin, J.-R.; School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, No.2006 XiYuan Road, West High-Tech Developing Zone, Chengdu 611731, China",,,,"2011 International Conference on Computational Problem-Solving, ICCP 2011","21 October 2011 through 23 October 2011","Chengdu",87810,,9781457706035,,,"English","Int.

This article describes the Fast Coherent Multiple Hypotheses (FCMH) method for highly efficient processing of coherent multiple hypotheses. The modulation of the signal is comprised of one modulation containing an a-priori known data sequence, and a second BPSK/QPSK modulation that does not contain a-priori known data. The known data is, for example, a pseudo-random periodic sequence such as the sequences used for CDMA and GNSS radio navigation modulations. The signal may further contain a frequency shift. The algorithm measures the signal's correlation delay with respect to the a-priori known sequence and its frequency shift. The method also decodes the signal's unknown data modulation. An example of a signal suitable for FCMH processing is the GPS signal. The GPS signal is a CDMA signal containing data bits modulation, CDMA code modulation and a frequency shift caused by the Doppler effect. Signals from other GNSS systems such as GLONASS, Galileo and Compass are also suitable for FCMH processing. The FCMH method enables detection and measurement of weak signals in challenging environments. The sensitivity achieved using FCMH better than that of non-coherent integration methods, and approaches the sensitivity of coherent integration. The advantage of FCMH over traditional coherent integration methods is that it does not require a-priori knowledge of the unknown data modulation at the receiver. FCMH uses a highly efficient computational algorithm to enable real-time processing on various platforms while using minimal resources. This article includes a theoretical derivation of the FCMH algorithm performance. It also presents experimental results with a real-life GNSS receiver that demonstrate processing gain and performance that is close to full coherent processing.",,"Algorithm performance; BPSK/QPSK; CDMA codes; CDMA signals; Coherent integration; Coherent processing; Computational algorithm; Data bits; Data modulation; Data sequences; Frequency shift; GALILEO; GLONASS; GNSS receivers; GNSS systems; GPS signals; Integration method; Measurement methods; Multiple hypothesis; Non-coherent; Periodic sequence; Processing gain; Pseudo random; Radio signals; Realtime processing; Theoretical derivations; Weak signals; Algorithms; Computational efficiency; Frequency shift keying; Global positioning system; Integration; Modulation; Signal detection",,,,,"(2010) Interface Specification, IS-GPS-200, Revision E, , Global Positioning System Wing (GPSW), 8 June; Meyer, D.P., Meyer, H.A., (1973) Radar Target Detection: Handbook of Theory and Practice, , Academic Pr, June; Zeidan, N.I., (2006) GNSS Receivers for Weak Signals, , Artech House Publishers","Shayevits, B.; CellGuide Ltd.Israel",,,,"24th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation 2011, ION GNSS 2011","19 September 2011 through 23 September 2011","Portland, OR",89839,,9781618394750,,,"English","Int.

Though the new signals own some merits, the receivers will meet many difficulties to track them. Not like the C/A code, the autocorrelation function(ACF) of MBOC(6,1,1/11) has one main peak as well as several side peaks. As a result, the DLL may surfer from false-lock at the side peaks, which would make the receivers not work in the end. To cancel the side peaks, many methods have been advanced, such as autocorrelation side peak cancellation technique (ASPeCT). Here we chiefly consider on a simpler algorithm, which is called 'BOC-PRN'. It only needs calculate the crosscorrelation function(CCF) of MBOC and PRN, and the result equals the phase error of MBOC signal exactly. However, the loop would lose lock easily because of bit transition and tracking error of carrier. In this paper, we analyze the characteristic of 'BOC-PRN' method and develop a modified algorithm, which can be free of bit transition and tracking error of carrier. The new method still computes the CCF of MBOC and PRN. Except that, it also calculates the CCF of early channel and late channel, like the case in general GPS receiver. A well estimation of phase error of MBOC has been gained based on them. The testing results show that in the environment of both weak signal and high dynamic, the novel algorithm could track the MBOC signals steadily and precisely.",,"Autocorrelation functions; Binary offset carriers; Cancellation techniques; Cross-correlation function; GNSS systems; GPS receivers; High dynamic; Modified algorithms; Navigation signals; Novel algorithm; Phase error; Precise positioning; SIMPLER algorithms; Testing results; Tracking algorithm; Tracking errors; Weak signals; Algorithms; Navigation; Regression analysis; Global positioning system",,,,,"(2006) GPS-Galileo Working Group A(WGA) Recommendations on L1 OS/LIC Optimization, , Galileo Joint Undertaking; www.cs.tut.fi/tlt/pos/MBOC_unambig_v05_final.pdf; Yao, Z., Lu, M., Feng, Z., Unambiguous Technique for Multiplexed Binary Offset Carrier Modulated Signals Tracking (2009) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 16 (7); Julien, O., Macabiau, C., Cannon, M.E., ASPeCT: Unambiguous Sine-BOC(n,n) Acquisition/Tracking Technique for Navigation Applications (2007) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 43 (1); Julien, O., Macabiau, C., Unambiguous CBOC Tracking with ASPeCT GNSS Signals Workshop 2007; Zhou, Y., Hu, X., Tang, Z., Unambiguous Tracking Technique for Sin-BOC(1,1) and MBOC(6,1, 1/11) Signals (2010) 2nd International Conference on Future Computer and Communication, 1, pp. 188-190; Dempster, A.G., Wu, J., Code discriminator for multiplexed binary offset carrier modulated signals (2008) Electronics Letters, 44 (5); Rebeyrol, E., Macabiau, C., Lestarquit, L., BOC Power Spectrum Densities ION NTM 2005; Parkinson, B.W., Spilker Jr., J.J., (1996) Global Positioning System: Theory and Application, 1. , American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc; Hinedi, S., Statman, J.I., High Dynamic GPS Tracking Final Report (1988) JPL Publication","Li, S.; Institute of Microelectronics of CASChina; email: lisichao@ime.ac.cn",,,,"24th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation 2011, ION GNSS 2011","19 September 2011 through 23 September 2011","Portland, OR",89839,,9781618394750,,,"English","Int.

The new approach, called EBMVDR in this paper, is based on noise suppression in signal subspace. Firstly, Eigen decomposition is used in covariance matrix of the received data vector in frequency domain, and then estimate noise power using the pre-estimated signal dimension. Next, the covariance matrix is reconstructed by suppressing noise in the signal subspace. Finally, the weight vector can be got for the new method. At the same time, array gain of EBMVDR is deduced. Theory analysis and statistical simulation results show that: when the noise is white, the lowest detection signal-noise ratio (SNR) performance improves 6dB compared to the conventional MVDR method. Moreover, the new method has good robustness and stable array gain within the whole bandwidth. © 2011 IEEE.","noise suppression; signal subspace; spatial spectrum detection; weak signal","Array gain; Broadband signal; Data vectors; Eigen decomposition; Frequency domains; Minimum variance distortionless response; Noise power; Noise suppression; Signal dimensions; Signal sub-space; Signal-noise ratio; Spatial spectra; Statistical simulation; Suppressing noise; Weak signals; Weight vector; Covariance matrix; Signal analysis; Telecommunication systems; Vectors; Signal detection",,,,,"Zhou, Z., Li, S., Cheng, Y., Wideband energy detection for partial-band interference in FFH system (2010) IEEE, PACCS, Second Pacific-Asia Conference on, pp. 390-393; Wang, F., Tian, Z., Sadler, B.M., Weighted energy detection for noncoherent ultra-wideband receiver design (2011) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 10, pp. 710-720. , February; Havary-Nassab, V., Hassan, S., Valaee, S., Compressive detection for wide-band spectrum sensing (2010) IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 3094-3097; Chen, Z., Li, J., Stoica, P., Lo, K.W., Iterative adaptive approach for wide-band active sonar array processing (2010) Sydney, IEEE Oceans, pp. 1-10; Hong, Y., Jianguo, H., Detection of long distance object based on MVDR for wideband underwater passive acoustic home guide system (2009) Acta Armamentaria, 30, pp. 160-164. , Feb; Li, G.-F., Hui, J.-Y., A study of mode domain MVDR algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition (2009) Acta Electronica Sincia, 37, pp. 942-946. , May; Van, T., Harry, L., Optimum array processing.

The complexity of the involved geomagnetic phenomena and the nature of the target detection strategy require the use of adaptive methods for signal processing. The paper shows that Computational Intelligence (CI) models can be integrated with those magnetic-based technologies, and presents an effective, reliable system for adaptive undersea protection. Two different CI paradigms are successfully tested for the specific application task: Circular BackPropagation (CBP) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Experimental results on real data prove the advantage of the integrated approach over existing conventional methods. Individual CI components and the overall detection system have been verified in real experiments. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Adaptive methods; Application tasks; Circular backpropagation; Computational intelligence methods; Conventional methods; Critical area; Detection system; Detection technology; Integrated approach; Protection systems; Reliable systems; Sea floor; Weak signals; Geomagnetism; Intrusion detection; Signal detection; Support vector machines; Underwater acoustics; Neural networks",,,,,"Yao, D., Azimi-Sadjadi, M.R., Jamshidi, A.A., Dobeck, G.J., A study of effects of sonar bandwidth for underwater target classification (2002) IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, 27, pp. 619-627. , July; Li, D., Azimi-Sadjiadi, M.R., Robinson, M., Comparison of different classification algorithms for underwater target discrimination (2004) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 15, pp. 189-194. , Jan; Azimi-Sadjadi, M.R., Yao, D., Huang, Q., Dobeck, G.J., Underwater target classification using wavelet packets and neural networks (2000) IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks, 11, pp. 784-794. , May; Azimi-Sadjadi, M.R., Yao, D., Jamshidi, A.A., Dobeck, J.G., Underwater target classification in changing environments using an adaptive feature mapping (2002) IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks, 13, pp. 1099-1111. , Sept; Gorman, R.P., Sejnowski, T.J., Analysis of hidden units in a layered network trained to classify sonar targets (1988) Neural Networks, 1, pp. 75-89; Urick, R.J., (1983) Principles of Underwater Sound, , McGraw-Hill (New York; Faggioni, O., Gabellone, A., Hollett, R., Kessel, R.T., Soldani, M., Anti-intruder port protection MAC (Magnetic ACoustic) System: Advances in the magnetic component performance (2008) 1st WSS Conference, pp. 25-28. , August, Copenhagen, Denmark; Vapnik, V., (1998) Statistical Learning Theory, pp. 339-346. , John Wiley, New York; Ridella, S., Rovetta, S., Zunino, R., Circular backpropagation networks for classification (1997) IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks, 8 (1), pp. 84-97; Gabellone, A., Faggioni, O., Soldani, M., Guerrini, P., CAIMAN (coastal anti intruder magnetometers network) (2008) Proc. of RTO-MPSET-130 Symposium on NATO Military Sensing, pp. 12-14. , March, Orlando, Florida, USA, NATO classified; Wang, L.P., Fu, X.J., (2005) Data Mining with Computational Intelligence, , Springer, Berlin; Hornik, K., Stinchcombe, M., White, H., Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators (1989) Neural Networks, 2 (5), pp. 359-356; Dasgupta, S., Gupta, A., (1999) An Elementary Proof of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, pp. 99-006. , Technical report, U.

The problem with conventional cyclostationarity-based feature detection is that the detection probability of weak signals degrades if multiple signals with different received-power levels are captured simultaneously. One way to address this problem is to use a multiple signal identification method in which appropriate notches suppress the effects of other signals. In this paper, we evaluate a multiple signal identification method based on test bed experiments. In order to evaluate the method in a realistic environment as a field test, a spatial channel emulator and an antenna of a mock terminal are applied to the test bed. The results reveal the effectiveness of the methodology in realistic spectrum sharing scenarios. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Detection probabilities; Detection technique; Experimental evaluation; Feature detection; Field test; Frame format; Frequency synchronization; Prior information; Realistic environments; Signal bandwidth; Signal identification; Spatial channels; Spectrum sharing; Weak signals; Equipment testing; Spectroscopy; Test facilities; Signal detection",,,,,"Mitola III, J., Maguire Jr., G.Q., Cognitive radio: Making software radios more personal (1999) IEEE Personal Commun., 6 (4), pp. 13-18. , Aug; Haykin, S., Cognitive radio: Brain-empowered wireless communications (2005) IEEE JSAC, 23 (2), pp. 201-220. , Feb; Gardner, W.A., (1993) Cyclostationarity in Communications and Signal Processing, , IEEE Press, New York; Gardner, W.A., Measurement of spectral correlation (1986) IEEE Trans.

The application of FPGA allows the user to vary the number of real-time channel response averages, channel sampling interval, and duration of measurement. The waveform, bandwidth, and frequency resolution of the sounder can be adapted for any channel under investigation. The design approach and technology used has led to a reduction in size and weight by more than 60. This makes the sounder ideal for mobile time-variant wireless communication channels studies. Averaging allows processing gains of up to 30dB to be achieved for measurement in weak signal conditions. The technique applied also improves reliability, reduces power consumption, and has shifted sounder design complexity from hardware to software. Test results show that the sounder can detect very small-scale variations in channels. © 2011 David L.

These are Corexit 9500 (the current product being used), DISPERSIT SPC 1000, JD 2000, Nokomis 3-F4, Nokomis 3-AA, SAF-RON GOLD, Sea Brat #4, and ZI-400. To address this request, ORD staff and outside collaborators carried out a number of separate studies that were run using in vitro (cell-based) assays. A total of 8 cytotoxicity assays, 3 AR agonist assays, 1 AR antagonist assay and 4 ER agonist assays were run on the 8 dispersants, plus reference compounds. Tests were run across a wide range of dispersant concentrations (0.001 to 10,000 parts per million, or ppm). Two dispersants showed a weak signal in one of the four ER assays, but integrating over all of the ER and AR results these data do not indicate that any of the eight dispersants display biologically significant endocrine activity via the androgen or estrogen signaling pathways. All of the dispersants showed cytotoxicity in at least one cell type at concentrations between 10 and 1000 ppm. Both JD 2000 and SAF-RON GOLD tend to be less cytotoxic than the other dispersants. Likewise, DISPERSIT SPC 1000 tends to be more cytotoxic than the other dispersants in the cell-based assays.

Many futurists are forecasting future technology based on Delphi study, brainstorming, expert survey, trend analysis, data mining, etc. However, these processes still need to be formalized. In this paper, we introduce the NEST (New & Emerging Signals of Trends) model, which is a systematic collective intelligence model for collecting information from expert network worldwide and detecting weak signals of emerging technologies, developed by KISTI. The most outstanding feature of NEST model is that it is based on both quantitative and qualitative methods. In the stages of quantitative methods, NEST performs clustering, pattern recognition, scientometrics, and cross impact analysis. In the stages of qualitative methods, NEST conducts environmental scanning, brainstorming, and Delphi study. For illustration purpose, a result of experiment for detecting weak signals of emerging technologies is presented.","Collaborative computing; Emerging trend detection; Mass knowledge; Weak signal","Collective intelligences; Cross-impact analysis; Emerging technologies; Emerging trends; Environmental scanning; Mass knowledge; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Weak signals; Computer supported cooperative work; Pattern recognition; Technology; Signal detection",,,,,"Choi, S.-B., Park, Y.-W., Hong, S.-W., Kim, K.-H., A study for the link service system of science & technology information, KISTI GTB (2009) Korea Contents 2009, pp. 731-736. , The Korea Contents Association, Busan, Korea, May; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260. , April; (2010) KISTI, GTB, Global Trends Briefing, , http://radar.ndsl.kr/; (2010) Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, , http://www.kisti.re.kr/english/; Porter, A.L., Cunningham, S.W., (2005) Tech Mining: Exploiting New Technologies for Competitive Advantage, , Wiley-InterScience","Technology Information Analysis Lab., Department of Information Analysis, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, 66, Hoegi-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-741, South Korea",,,,"EKAW 2010 Poster and Demo Track","11 October 2010 through 15 October 2010","Lisbon",101338,16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889650308

Based on the analysis of orbit parameters' effects on the Doppler shift, this article concludes that it is necessary to improve BAP for using in the high orbit environment. From the offset compensation of code Doppler, calculated amount improvement of the algorithm, threshold value reduced, this article does further improvement to the BAP algorithm, making it suitable for high-orbit environment.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze why firms with average quality debt have not changed their tactics and consent to publishing their grade which would then differentiate an average quality debt from a riskier one. Design/methodology/approach: The paper estimates the mean values of ranks and the diagonal of the migration matrix on the basis of data on 1,639 bond rankings listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and publications by the largest Israeli rating agency, Maalot. Findings: From 1992 to 2004, one-third of the Israeli firms that had initially requested ranking from a rating agency decided to prevent publication. The findings show the average bond rankings published by Israeli rating agencies tend to be relatively high, while bond rating migration is relatively slow. There was no change in the shape of the statistical distribution of ratings between 2004 and 2007. The strategy of borrowers has remained stable and shows no change over 16 years of credit ratings in Israel. Practical implications: Debtors with an average quality debt view the publications of the credit agency as a weak signal and do not expect the investment community to give them better credit for an average grade. To obtain more detailed ratings, regulators along with the credit rating agencies should consider enforcement of the publication of the rank of firms that requested evaluation. Originality/value: The paper offers insights into why credit ratings in Israel have remained stable over the last decade and explains why Israeli firms with average quality debt do not change their strategy and do not request credit rating agencies to issue their grade publically which could then distinguish them from firms with worse quality debt. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bonds; Credit rating; Israel",,,,,,"Acharya, S., A generalized econometric model and tests of a signalling hypothesis with two discrete signals (1988) Journal of Finance, 43 (2), pp. 413-429; Altman, E.I., The importance and subtlety of credit rating migration (1998) Journal of Banking & Finance, 22, pp. 1231-1247; Altman, E.I., Kao, D.L., The implications of corporate bond ratings drift (1992) Financial Analysts Journal, 48 (3), pp. 64-75; www.mof.gov.il/bachar/pdf/bacharFullReport.pdf, Bachar Committee (2004), (accessed October 10, 2006); Bangia, A., Diebold, F.X., Kronimus, A., Schagen, C., Schuermann, T., Ratings migration and the business cycle, with application to credit portfolio stress testing (2002) Journal of Banking & Finance, 26 (2), pp. 445-474; (2009) Main Israeli Economic Data, , www.bankisrael.gov.il/deptdata/mehkar/indic/indice.htm, Bank of Israel, available at: (accessed June 5, 2009); Beaver, W.H., Shakespeare, C., Soliman, M.T., Differential properties in the ratings of certified versus non-certified bond-rating agencies (2006) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 42 (3), pp. 303-334; Byoun, S., Shin, Y., Unsolicited credit rating theory and empirical analysis (2002) Proceedings of the Midwest Business Economics, pp. 98-112; Faulkender, M., Petersen, M.A., Does the source of capital affect capital structure?

In addition, Wi-Fi is not only growing in terms of numbers, but is also becoming pervasive in many respects. We are not concerned so much with the remarkable features and development patterns of Wi-Fi, however, as with the open-ended questions that Wi-Fi still raises and the uncertainties and complexities it carries with it. In this chapter, we envisage the possible futures of Wi-Fi. In the second section, we acknowledge the historical build-up and successful characteristics of Wi-Fi. In this evolution we include quantitative and qualitative evidence, as well as a few material narratives that are strongly supportive of current Wi-Fi developments. In this context, we consider what to make of the various forecasts, and how to establish the kind of knowledge perspective that users and decision makers can work with, and therefore what kind of methodological pathways may help us reach our goal. In the third section, we discuss the question of whether the future of Wi-Fi can somehow be ‘guessed’ from existing innovation models, or how to use such models in an open and helpful manner. In the fourth section, we explore the Wi-Fi journey that still lies ahead of us, in terms of options, contexts and conditions, in particular through a micro-Delphi study – i.e. a specific enquiry among experts. We present the rough output of this exploratory study in the form of potential scenarios. In the fifth and concluding section, we examine what might be some weak signals of change or, on the contrary, might be reinforcements of trends that provide early indications as to the Wi-Fi to come in the next ten years or so. We argue that one of the aspects that will be a deciding factor between the various options is the dynamic tension between innovation and regulation. © Wolter Lemstra, Vic Hayes and John Groenewegen 2011.",,,,,,,"Bass, F.M., The adoption of a marketing model: Comments and observations (1986) Innovation Diffusion Models of New Product Acceptance, pp. 203-232. , V.

Arcing sound , arcing light and current happen simultaneously. The monitor system sends out warning signals of arcing fault . The system fulfills on2line detection for arcing fault , and early warning is established by arcing sound , arcing light and short2circuit current . The system is proved by experiment to be of high accuracy and high speed. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Arcing faults; Automatic cuts; Bifurcation behaviors; Chaotic oscillators; Detection methods; Duffing oscillators; Early warnings; High accuracies; High speeds; Low voltages; Monitor systems; Power sources; Power supplies; Warning signals; Weak signals; Circuit oscillations; Competition; Electric power systems; Fault detection; Integrated circuits; Military operations; Monolithic integrated circuits; Oscillators (mechanical); Signal processing; Voltage distribution measurement; Signal detection",,,,,"Dr, Kanamaru, T., Kogakuin University, Japan Scholarpedia, 3 (3), p. 6327; Thompson, J.M.T., Stewart, H.B., (2002) Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, , 2nd edition, John Wiley & Sons; Holmes, P., Whitley, D., On the attracting set for Duffing's equation, II.

At the same time, the fact remains that unless the contextual differences with developed economies are accounted for, researchers could misspecify research designs. The pace of evolution of 'context' in emerging economies, coupled with 'weak signals' emanating from sparsely distributed data points calls for the primacy of idiographic explanations, such as those afforded by the case study method. As case research links observations, experiences and underlying mechanisms, it allows the researcher to tackle problems associated with continuous transformation of institutional arrangements in emerging economies. In contrast, a researcher employing conventional survey research in such settings may not be alert to either the presence of unfamiliar contingencies or the operation of hitherto dormant mechanisms, resulting in low 'validity.' Furthermore, such survey research would have low 'reliability' due to low statistical power of the significance tests. With its potential for higher validity and higher reliability under such circumstances, we argue that the case study method is a more appropriate and powerful tool to capture rich data for theory building in emerging economies.","Case study method; Emerging economies; Research design","Continuous transformations; Developed economies; Dim light; Distributed data points; Emerging economies; Institutional arrangement; Research design; Research designs; Research fields; Significance test; Statistical power; Study methods; Survey research; Theory building; Underlying mechanism; Weak signals; Reliability theory; Surveys; Research",,,,,"Boyacigiller, N.A., Adler, N.J., The parochial dinosaur: Organizational science in a global context (1991) Academy of Management Review, 16, pp. 262-290; George, A.L., Bennett, A., (2005) Case Studies and Theory Development in the Social Sciences, , MIT Press; Hoskisson, R.E., Eden, L., Lau, C.M., Wright, M., Strategy in emerging economies (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43, pp. 249-267; King, G., Keohane, R.O., Verba, S., (1994) Designing Social Inquiry, , Princeton University Press; Labovitz, S., Criteria for selecting a significance level: A note on the sacredness of. 05 (1968) American Sociologist, 3, pp. 200-222; Lee, T.W., (1999) Using Qualitative Methods in Organizational Research, , Sage Publications; Johns, G., Praise of context (2001) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 22, pp. 31-42; Johns, G., The essential impact of context on organizational behavior (2006) Academy of Management Review, 31, pp. 386-408; Morgan, G., Smircich, L., The case for qualitative research (1980) Academy of Management Review, 5, pp. 491-500; Narayanan, V.K., Fahey, L., The relevance of the institutional underpinnings of porter's five forces framework to emerging economies: An epistemological analysis (2005) Journal of Management Studies, 42, pp. 207-223; Numagami, T., The infeasibility of invariant laws in management studies: A reflective dialogue in defense of case studies (1998) Organization Science, 9, pp. 2-15; Pondy, L.R., Olson, M.L., Theories of extreme cases (1977) The American Psychological Association Symposium, , Paper presented at San Francisco, CA; Popper, K.R., (1959) The Logic of Scientific Discovery, , London: Hutchinson & Co; Rosnow, R.L., Rosenthal, R., Statistical procedures and the justification of knowledge in psychological science (1989) American Psychologist, 44, pp. 1276-1284; Rousseau, D.M., Fried, Y., Location, location, location: Contextualizing organizational research (2001) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 22, pp. 1-13; Stoecker, R., Evaluating and rethinking the case study (1991) Sociological Review, 39, pp. 88-112; Tsoukas, H., The validity of idiographic research explanations (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 551-561; Wright, M., Filatotchev, I., Hoskisson, R.E., Peng, M.W., Strategy research in emerging economies: Challenging the conventional wisdom (2005) Journal of Management Studies, 42, pp. 1-33; Van Maanen, J., Style as theory (1995) Organization Science, 6, pp. 133-143; White, S., Rigor and relevance in Asian management research: Where are we and where can we go?

In this paper, a novel motif discovery method based on motif clustering and matching is proposed. Against a precompiled library of motifs which is represented by position weight matrices(PWMs), each L-mer in the dataset is matched to a motif base on the match score's P-value, then the PWMs are updated and clustered according to their similarity. Motif features are ranked in term of statistical significance (P-value). The advantage of this approach is that it can be used to simultaneously characterize every feature present in the dataset thus lessening the chance that weaker signals will be missed. We apply our method (implemented as a computer program called MotifCM) to the benchmark which has 56 datasets, and demonstrate that MotifCM achieves improved performance over several other popular motif discovery tools. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Computer programs; Data sets; Match scores; Motif discoveries; P values; Promoter sequences; Statistical significances; Transcription factor binding sites; Transcription regulations; Weight matrices; Binding energy; Binding sites; Computers; Pulse width modulation; Software engineering; Transcription factors; Transcription",,,,,"Tompa, M., Li, N., Bailey, T.L., Chruch, G.M., De Moor, B., Eskin, E., Assessing computational tools for the discovery of transcription factor binding sites (2005) Nature Biotechnology, 23, pp. 137-144; Hu, J., Li, B., Kihara, D., Limitations and potentials of current motif discovery algorithms (2005) Nucleic Acids Research, 33, pp. 4899-4913; Bailey, T.L., Elkan, C., Unsupervised learning of multiple motifs in biopolymers using expectation maximization (1995) Machine Learning, 21, pp. 51-80; Ao, W., Gaudet, J., Kent, W.J., Muttumu, S., Mango, S.E., Environmentally induced foregut remodeling by PHA-4/FoxA and DAF-12/NHR (2004) Science, 305, pp. 1743-1746; Hughes, J.D., Estep, P.W., Tavazoie, S., Church, G.M., Computational identification of cis-regulatory elements associated with functionally coherent groups of genes in Saccharomyeds cerevisiae (2000) J.

To reduce and detect major security risks at an earlier step of the IS project, our approach is based on different knowledge exchange between end users, analyst, designers and developers. The knowledge is mainly oriented to the detection of weak signals inside the organization.

Seismological observations are collected using two types of tool, namely permanent observatories (known also as earthquake-monitoring networks) and temporary observatories. The main objectives of the permanent observatories are to monitor the Earth's seismicity, whether natural or man-induced, then calculate the characteristics and store the recordings for structural and internaldynamics studies. The durable nature of the monitoring networks means that rare highmagnitude earthquakes can be recorded, and that observations can be accumulated over very long periods, the sum of which can help observe very weak signals, such as those derived from the Earth's core. These observatories are the foundations beneath the global imagery of the Earth. Improving our understanding of the structure of the Earth and its internal dynamics is therefore a vital objective. It is also a research priority, the findings of which -in terms of management and prevention of those risks associated with natural hazards- are significant The risks related to the Earth's seismic activity are constrained by complex physics, and their understanding demands detailed and high-quality observation. France is equipped with several national ? earthquake-monitoring networks, including the Laboratoire de Détection et de Géophysique of the CEA (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - French Atomic Energy Commisssion) and the RéNaSS, the roles of which are to monitor French territory. The Céoscope network, with world-wide coverage, is responsible for global imagery, whereas the Réseau Accélérométrique Permanent (RAP: French Accelerometric Network) is designed to study major ground movements. Several other earthquake-monitoring networks exist on a regional scale, particularly in the West Indies. Nevertheless, the permanent observatories alone cannot possibly collect all the data, at all scales, necessary for the whole range of scientific studies, and these must be complemented by temporary mobile networks.",,"core (planetary); disaster management; dynamic response; earthquake; foundation; ground movement; monitoring; risk factor; seismicity; structural response; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe",,,,,,"Lardeaux, J.-M.; Université de Nice Sophia-AntipolisFrance; email: lardeaux@unice.fr",,,,,,,,1772094X,,,,"French","Geosciences",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547623947

It is shown that atomic resolution electron tomography is in principle possible and may provide atom position coordinates with sufficient precision to use as input data for theoretical ab-initio calculations. For amorphous materials which are subject to radiation damage it may require a lower voltage and the use of a Cs and Cc corrector. For perfect crystalline samples the projected structure can be reconstructed from exit waves using the channeling theory. Combining the reconstructions obtained from different zone axis orientations then yields the 3D atomic structure. The most difficult objects will be semicrystalline materials where strong dynamic scattering interferes with weak signals from the aperiodicity. Here we suggest to use a new technique called precession laminography. Finally, doubt is raised about the practical usability of optical sectioning by HAADF STEM.","Atomic resolution; Electron tomography; Precision","Atoms; Calculations; Electric impedance tomography; Electrons; Radiation damage; Tomography; Ab initio calculations; Atomic resolution; Crystalline samples; Dynamic scattering; Electron tomography; Precision; Semicrystalline materials; Zone-axis orientations; Amorphous materials",,,,,"Henderson, R., (1995) Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics, 28, p. 171; Midgley, P.A., Thomas, J.M., Laffont, L., Weyland, M., Raja, R., Johnson, B.F.G., Khimyak, T., (2004) Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 108, p. 4590; Midgley, P.A., Weyland, M., (2003) Ultramicroscopy, 96, p. 413; Ziese, U., De Jong, K.P., Koster, A.J., (2004) Applied Catalysis A – General, 260, p. 71; Kubel, C., Voigt, A., Schoenmakers, R., Otten, M., Su, D., Lee, T.C., Carlsson, A., Bradley, J., (2005) Microscopy and Microanalysis, 11, p. 378; Philp, E., Sloan, J., Kirkland, A.I., Meyer, R.R., Friedrichs, S., Hutchison, J.L., Green, M.L.H., (2003) Nature Materials, 2, p. 788; Coene, W.M.J., Thust, A., Op De Beeck, M., Van Dyck, D., (1996) Ultramicroscopy, 64, p. 109; Rose, H., (1990) Optik, 85, p. 19; Van Dyck, D., Van Aert, S., Den Dekker, A.J., Van den Bos, A., (2003) Ultramicroscopy, 98, p. 27; Van Dyck, D., De Jong, A.F., (1992) Ultramicroscopy, 47, p. 266; Kak, A.C., Slaney, M., (1988) Computerized Tomographic Imaging, , IEEE Press, New York; Midgley, P.A., Weyland, M., (2002) Ultramicroscopy, 96, p. 413; Frank, J., (1992) Electron Tomography, , Three-dimensional Imaging with the Transmission Electron Microscope, Plenum Press, New York; Van Den Bos, A., Den Dekker, A.J., (2001) Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics, 117, p. 241; Van Aert, S., Den Dekker, A.J., Van Den Bos, A., Van Dyck, D., (2004) Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics, 130, p. 1; Van Aert, S., Den Dekker, A.J., Van Dyck, D., Van Den Bos, A., (2002) J.

This case is in the situation of small parameters. However, with large parameters, it is impossible for the small parameter SR. For the problem, a new way of scale transformation stochastic resonance (STSR) is proposed. The proposed method can not only realize the large parameter SR-like response, but also successfully extract the weak signal from strong noise. With the large parameter STSR technique, the properties of the power spectrum of a bistable system have been thoroughly investigated, which demonstrates that, to obtain an explicit maximal SR-like spectral peak at the weak signal frequency, the ratio of sampling frequency and the signal frequency should be equal or larger than fifty. A practical engineering application, monitoring and diagnosis of mechanical faults of an electromotor, proves that the approach of large parameter STSR is of promising future in the engineering signal processing.","Bistable system; Noise; Numerical analysis; Scale transformation stochastic resonance; Weak signal detection","Bistable system; Lorentz; Lower frequencies; Mechanical faults; Monitoring and diagnosis; Noise; Power energy; Practical engineering applications; Response power; Sampling frequencies; Scale transformation; Signal frequencies; Spectral peak; Stochastic resonances; Weak signal detection; Weak signals; Circuit resonance; Cybernetics; Information science; Magnetic resonance; Numerical analysis; Power spectrum; Signal processing",,,,,"Benzi, R., Sutera, A., Vulpiana, A., The mechanism of stochastic resonance (1981) J.

Numerical analyses have been made on the stochastic resonance model in bi-stable dynamical systems. The results show that a sinusoidal signal and a noise signal are used as the Wiener process corresponding to the input sinusoidal signal and the input white noise, respectively. When the system parameters are appropriately selected, the coupling effect between the sinusoidal signal and the white noise can be weakened and the noise can be suppressed, thus the effect of signal modulating noise can occur in the output. In this case the frequency and the magnitude of the weak sinusoidal signal submerged in the noise can be evaluated by an analysis on the power spectral density of the system output signal. Numerical simulation shows that the application is also effective on the detection of several weak sinusoidal signals submerged in the noise.","Bi-stable system; Detection; Effect of signal modulating noise; Stochastic resonance; Weak signal",,,,,,,"Xiao, F.-H.; Sch. of Civil Eng. and Mech., Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., Xi'an 710049, China; email: xiaofh.xjtu@163.com",,,,,,,,10049037,,SCYCE,,"Chinese","Shu Ju Cai Ji Yu Chu Li",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-4544236479

Our approach is based on the use of zero crossings as a discordancy measure (with desirable properties for detecting weak signals and robustness to certain data transformations), with random algebraic polynomials describing the curves of interest. The latter provide a simple means of modeling non-stationary, non-Gaussian curves. Our algorithm may be useful in detecting the presence or absence of signals which generate residual curves with large numbers of zero crossings (see [28]), provided the signals of interest can be described by a random polynomial with zero mean. To assess the robustness of our approach, we determine the rate at which our discordancy measure converges to normality and calculate its distribution for polynomials of order n ≤ 100 by simulation. We see that the distribution of our discordancy measure is insensitive to the shape of the marginal distributions of the coefficients of the random polynomial model for moderately large values of n, although the rate of convergence to normality is relatively slow. The asymptotic approximations to the mean and variance of our discordancy measure are less satisfactory.","Anomalous curves; Central limit theorem; Random polynomial; Zero crossing","Poles and zeros; Polynomials; Random processes; Theorem proving; Random algebraic polynomials; Computational geometry",,,,,"Houghton, J.T., Problems in the retrieval of useful atmospheric information from satellite remote sensing observations (1989) Mathematics in Remote Sensing, pp. 5-16. , Ed.

In this paper, ARE is applied to some distributed detection cases which use counting (k out of N) fusion rules. In such cases one finds that ARE generally depends on the power of the tests which can make its applications difficult. This dependence turns out to be relatively weak in cases we consider and the ARE is reasonably well approximated by the limit of the ARE as the detection probability approaches the false alarm probability. This approximation should be useful for distributed cases. Some specific results provide the best counting fusion rules for cases with identical sensor detectors if one uses asymptotically large observation sample sizes at each sensor.
