From the point of view of demand modelling, car sharing is a weak signal in the city landscape: only a small percentage of the population uses it, and thus it is difficult to study reliably with traditional techniques such as households travel diaries. In this work, we depart from these traditional approaches and we leverage web-based, digital records about vehicle availability in 10 European cities for one of the major active car sharing operators. We discuss which sociodemographic and urban activity indicators are associated with variations in car sharing demand, which forecasting approach (among the most popular in the related literature) is better suited to predict pickup and drop-off events, and how the spatio-temporal information about vehicle availability can be used to infer how different zones in a city are used by customers. We conclude the paper by presenting a direct application of the analysis of the dataset, aimed at identifying where to locate maintenance facilities within the car sharing operation area. © 2019, The Author(s).","Car sharing; Data mining; Smart transportation; Urban computing","Data mining; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; Demand modelling; Maintenance facility; Parking demands; Spatiotemporal information; Traditional approaches; Traditional techniques; Transportation infrastructures; Urban computing; Electronic document exchange",,,,,"Mitchell, W.J., Borroni-Bird, C.E., Burns, L.D., (2010) Reinventing the automobile.

To our knowledge, to date, WD40 superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in several plant species, but little information is available on the WD40 superfamily genes in peach. In this study, we identified 220 members of the WD40 superfamily in the peach genome, and these members were further classified into five subfamilies based on phylogenetic comparison with those in Arabidopsis. The members within each subfamily had conserved motifs and gene structures. The WD40 genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. Additionally, 58 pairs of paralog WD40 members were found on eight chromosomes in peach, and 242 pairs of orthologous WD40 genes in peach and Arabidopsis were matched. The 54 selected putative WD40 genes in peach had diverse expression patterns in red-fleshed and white-fleshed peach fruits at five developmental stages. Prupe.6G211800.1 was located only on the cytomembrane, while Prupe.1G428200.1 and Prupe.I003200.1 were located on both the cytomembrane and in the nucleus; Prupe.1G558700.1 was densely localized around the nuclear rim but relatively faintly localized in the nucleoplasm; Prupe.5G116300.1 was located in the nucleus and cytomembrane with strong signals but showed weak signals in the cytoplasm; and Prupe.8G212400.1 and Prupe.1G053600.1 were located mainly in the nuclear envelope and cytomembrane but relatively faintly in the nucleoplasm. This study provides a foundation for the further functional verification of WD40 genes in peach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Expression; Peach; Subcellular localization; Subfamily classification; WD40 superfamily","Arabidopsis; article; cell nucleus membrane; cellular distribution; chromosome; cytoplasm; developmental stage; gene expression; gene structure; nonhuman; paralogy; peach; cell nucleus; chromosomal mapping; conserved sequence; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; multigene family; peach; phylogeny; plant chromosome; procedures; WD repeat; plant protein; Cell Nucleus; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Conserved Sequence; Cytoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Prunus persica; WD40 Repeats",,"Plant Proteins",,,"Aguilar-Barragan, A., Ochoa-Alejo, N., Virus-induced silencing of MYB and WD40 transcription factor genes affects the accumulation of anthocyanins in chilli pepper fruit (2014) Biol.

Here we review the evidence linking protection from local pressures (e.g., fishing and habitat destruction) with increased resilience. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings, studies have only rarely attributed resilience responses to the recovery of food webs and habitats, and increases in the diversity of communities and populations. When detected, resistance to ocean warming and recovery after extreme events in MPAs have small effect sizes against a backdrop of natural variability. By contrast, large die-offs are well described from MPAs following climate stress events. This may be in part because protection from one set of pressures or drivers (such as fishing) can select for species that are highly sensitive to others (such as warming), creating a ‘Protection Paradox’. Given that climate change is overwhelming the resilience capacity of marine ecosystems, the only primary solution is to reduce carbon emissions. High-quality monitoring data in both space and time can also identify emergent resilience signals that do exist, in combination with adequate reference data to quantify the initial system state. This knowledge will allow networks of diverse protected areas to incorporate spatial refugia against climate change, and identify resilient biological components of natural systems. Sufficient spatial replication further offers insurance against losses in any given MPA, and the possibility for many weak signals of resilience to accumulate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"carbon emission; climate change; data quality; ecosystem resilience; food web; habitat fragmentation; human activity; knowledge; marine park",,,,,"Alonso Aller, E., Jiddawi, N.S., Eklöf, J.S., Marine protected areas increase temporal stability of community structure, but not density or diversity, of tropical seagrass fish communities (2017) PLoS One, 12; Anderson, C.N.K., Hsieh, C.-H., Sandin, S.A., Hewitt, R., Hollowed, A., Beddington, J., May, R.M., Sugihara, G., Why fishing magnifies fluctuations in fish abundance (2008) Nature, 452, p. 835; Arlinghaus, R., Laskowski, K.L., Alós, J., Klefoth, T., Monk, C.T., Nakayama, S., Schröder, A., Passive gear-induced timidity syndrome in wild fish populations and its potential ecological and managerial implications (2017) J.

In this work, solar-blind field-effect phototransistor based on radio-frequency-magnetron sputtered amorphous gallium oxide thin film with ultrahigh photodetection performance are demonstrated. The key feature of the device is gate-tunable photodetection enabling ultrahigh responsivity of 4.1 × 103 A W−1, external quantum efficiency of 2 × 106%, and detectivity of 2.5 × 1013 Jones under a 70 µW cm−2 weak signal of 254 nm light due to a high internal gain and field effect control of the phototransistor. Furthermore, high-resolution imaging is achieved for the imaging target by integrating the as-fabricated photodetectors into the imaging system, which is the first report on solar-blind imaging of amorphous gallium oxide photodetectors. Such field-effect phototransistors with ultrahigh performance and excellent imaging capability address a significant step toward the feasibility and practicability of gallium oxide photodetectors in solar-blind imaging system. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Yet, surprisingly little is known about the impact of routine interpersonal contacts in shaping microbiome composition. In a relatively ‘closed’ cohort of 287 people from the Fiji Islands, where common barriers to bacterial transmission are absent, we examine putative bacterial transmission in individuals’ gut and oral microbiomes using strain-level data from both core single-nucleotide polymorphisms and flexible genomic regions. We find a weak signal of transmission, defined by the inferred sharing of genotypes, across many organisms that, in aggregate, reveals strong transmission patterns, most notably within households and between spouses. We were unable to determine the directionality of transmission nor whether it was direct. We further find that women harbour strains more closely related to those harboured by their familial and social contacts than men, and that transmission patterns of oral-associated and gut-associated microbiota need not be the same. Using strain-level data alone, we are able to confidently predict a subset of spouses, highlighting the role of shared susceptibilities, behaviours or social interactions that distinguish specific links in the social network. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"adult; bacterial transmission; controlled study; female; Fiji; gastrointestinal tract; gene mutation; genetic association; genotype; household; human; letter; male; microbiome; nonhuman; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; social interaction; social network; spouse",,,,,"Moeller, A.H., Rapid changes in the gut microbiome during human evolution (2014) Proc.

However, the process through which such sustainable rejuvenation can be planned and pursued has been largely overlooked. In addition, available research about sustainable rejuvenation usually applies the triple bottom line framework while neglecting the fourth dimension of sustainability, time. The purpose of this study was to understand the motivations and perceptions of tourists regarding the sustainability of Sirmione (a tourism destination on Lake Garda, Italy) and to discuss the results with Sirmione's stakeholders and decision planners to identify priority interventions for sustainable rejuvenation. In recent times, Sirmione has undergone significant changes (related, for example, to the type of incoming tourists) and even if it is still ‘successful’, planners have started reflecting on the need for the town's rejuvenation. This study was approached through the two-tiered sustainability equilibria framework, which suggests a dynamic view of sustainability combining economic, environmental and social aspects with short-, long- and longer-term views. The study was based on data collected through a survey of 328 visitors to Sirmione and analysed through both descriptive statistics and contents analysis. The results of the survey served as the input for the subsequent collective learning process with local tourism operators. Through this process, Sirmione's destination planners were able to intercept weak signals about the evolution of visitor demand and competition. As a result, they developed a list of five priority interventions to implement through a strategic plan for rejuvenation while the destination is still successful. Embedded in the strategic plan were the two tiers of sustainability—economic, environmental and social, and short-, long- and longer-term perspectives. The results of this study contribute to highlighting the relevance of considering time (in addition to economic, social and environmental aspects) to explain the sustainable rejuvenation of a mature tourism destination. In addition, the study provides suggestions on the role of a destination's public and private actors to adopt a combination of initiatives to pursue sustainable rejuvenation. © 2019","Destination management; Longitudinal perspective; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainable development; Tourism destination; Visitor satisfaction","Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Endocrinology; Social aspects; Strategic planning; Surveys; Collective learning; Descriptive statistics; Longitudinal perspective; Social and environmental; Sustainability dimensions; Tourism destination; Tourist destinations; Visitor satisfaction; Sustainable development",,,,,"Agarwal, S., Restructuring seaside tourism: the resort lifecyle (2002) Ann.

Early risk assessment is therefore critical for the improvement of transplantation outcomes. In this work, we retrospectively analyzed a pre-transplant HLA antigen bead assay data set that was acquired by the e:KID consortium as part of a systems medicine approach. Results: The data set included single antigen bead (SAB) reactivity profiles of 52 low-risk graft recipients (negative complement dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch, PRA < 30%) who showed detectable pre-transplant anti-HLA 1 antibodies. To assess whether the reactivity profiles provide a means for ACR risk assessment, we established a novel approach which differs from standard approaches in two aspects: the use of quantitative continuous data and the use of a multiparameter classification method. Remarkably, it achieved significant prediction of the 38 graft recipients who experienced ACR with a balanced accuracy of 82.7% (sensitivity = 76.5%, specificity = 88.9%). Conclusions: The resultant classifier achieved one of the highest prediction accuracies in the literature for pre-transplant risk assessment of ACR. Importantly, it can facilitate risk assessment in non-sensitized patients who lack donor-specific antibodies. As the classifier is based on continuous data and includes weak signals, our results emphasize that not only strong but also weak binding interactions of antibodies and HLA 1 antigens contain predictive information.

This paper introduces the relevant theories of chance discovery, discusses the advantages of chance discovery, which can connect the weak signals demand with the implicit related resources, and proposes a personalized recommendation algorithm based on the chance discovery so as to dig deeper into the potential requirements and preferences of users. In the experiment, we not only consider the precision but also refer to the diversity and novelty as the evaluation index. Through the extensive experiments, we compared with traditional recommendation algorithms, and then it is proved that our algorithm is helpful to improve the quality of the recommendation. © 2018 IEEE.","Chance diversity; KeyGraph; Recommendation system; User preferences","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Recommender systems; Chance diversity; Information overloads; Information resource; Keygraph; Personalized recommendation; Recommendation algorithms; Social network services; User preferences; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Shu, J., A content-based recommendation algorithm for learning resources (2017) Multimedia Systems; Rasanen, E., Kikta, R., (2018) Location-Based Novelty Index Value and Recommendation System and Method; Chen, T., Hong, L., Shi, Y., (2017) Joint Text Embedding for Personalized Content-based Recommendation; An improved clustering-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm (2017) Cluster Computing, , Liu; Ohsawa, Y., (2001) The Scope of Chance Discovery; Ohsawa, Y., Introduction to chance discovery (2002) Journal of Contingencies & Crisis Management10, 2, pp. 61-62; Ohsawa, Y., Keygraph: Visualized structure among event clusters (2003) Chance Discovery, 64 (2), pp. 161-174; Ohsawa, Y., Modeling the process of chance discovery (2003) Chance Discovery; Ohsawa, Y., Keygraph as risk explorer in earthquake-sequence (2010) Journal of Contingencies & Crisis Management, 10 (3), pp. 119-128; Ohsawa, Y., Chance discoveries for making decisions in complex real world (2002) New Generation Computing",,,"Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence;IEEE Beijing Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems, CCIS 2018","23 November 2018 through 25 November 2018",,147453,,9781538660041,,,"English","Proc.

Expenditure growth on average is about 2.5% a year (OECD, 2015) most notably led by the impact of ageing population. One of the areas with the fastest growth due to the “ageing-boom” is that the senior care. Technology investment is necessary to cope with the surge of patients. Internet of Things is one of those solutions. Too few studies have analyzed the organizational impact of these technologies. We propose a model confounding organizational perspective and anthropology. We seek to understand how the diversity of technological tools can give meaning to their implementation in the organization. Based on experts' statements and analysing weak signals, we suggest three trends: the Internet of Things strengthens patients' autonomy; it fights against the negative image of Senior care and ensures continuity between homecare services and institutionalization. The Internet of Things strengthens the bureaucratic aspect of Senior care, which in certain respects sound like highly bureaucratic organization where control becomes dominant. The duty of monitoring, control and transparency is enhanced by disempowering professionals and changing the tasks of Senior care directors whose supervisory task has grown major. The Internet of Things can strengthen an opposite organizational model based on technical and human networks. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Anthropology of techniques; Connected objects; Organization; Senior care","Population statistics; Societies and institutions; Anthropology of techniques; Connected objects; Organizational impacts; Organizational modeling; Organizational perspectives; Senior care; Technological tools; Technology investments; Internet of things; aging population; bureaucracy; expenditure; Internet; organization; technological development",,,,,"Akrich, M., La construction d'un système socio-technique.

The intensity of the Q4 species A1 symmetric stretch is exceptionally weak in vitreous silica (v-SiO2) but it increases dramatically with addition of small amounts of Cs2O to the glass. We propose that Cs, where in close proximity to BO of Q4 species, promotes the polarizability of Q4 tetrahedra and these primed Q4 species (Q4-p) produce a strong Q4 signal. There are, therefore, two variants of the Q4 species, a Q4-p species which produces a strong signal, and an unprimed species (Q4-u) which yields a very weak signal. The increase in the abundance of the primed Q4 species (Q4-p) can be modelled as a function of alkali content using a simple, upper-bounded growth model: XQ4-p = (1 − e−kx) where XQ4-p is the fraction of polarizable Q4 species, k is a constant and x is the mol% counter oxide in the glass (here Cs2O). Comparison of calculated XQ4-p values with experimental results indicates that its cross-section is similar to that of the Q3 species. There is no evidence for a ~1050 cm−1 band in the 5 mol% Cs2O glass spectrum but in the 30 mol% Cs2O glass spectrum about 11% of spectral intensity is observed at about this frequency. The intensity likely results from development of asymmetry on the Q3 band, which increases with Cs2O content of the glass. The asymmetry results from weakened Si–O force constants of some Q3 tetrahedra due to charge transfer via Cs–BO bonds. As evidence, Si 2p and O 1s X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopic (XPS) studies demonstrate that the electron density over Si and BO atoms of Q4 species increases with Cs2O content. With charge transfer to tetrahedra, the negative charge accumulates preferentially on Si atoms thus decreasing Si–O coulombic interactions, weakening Si–O force constants, and shifting the Q3 A1 symmetric stretch vibrational frequencies to lower values (e.g., from ~1100 cm−1 to ~1050 cm−1). The fraction of affected Q3 species increases with alkali content, as does the Q3 peak asymmetry. The Raman shifts of the Q4 species are also affected by increased Cs2O contents. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Lorentzian line shapes; Q species abundances; Raman line shapes; Raman Linewidths; Raman spectra of Cs-silicate glasses","Atoms; Cesium; Charge transfer; Geometry; Glass; Raman scattering; Silica; Silicates; Silicon; Lorentzian line shape; Raman line shapes; Raman line width; Silicate glass; Species abundance; Cesium compounds; cesium; chemical composition; experimental study; glass; Raman spectroscopy; silicate",,,,,"Bancroft, G.M., Nesbitt, H.W., Henderson, G.S., O'Shaughnessy, C., Withers, A.C., Neuville, D.R., Lorentzian dominated line shapes and linewidths for Raman symmetric stretch peaks (800–1200 cm−1) in Qn (n = 1–3) species of alkali silicate glasses/melts (2018) J.

However, the stability of current ion clocks is fundamentally limited by the weak signal of single-ion interrogation. We present an operational, scalable platform for extending clock spectroscopy to arrays of Coulomb crystals consisting of several tens of ions while allowing systematic shifts as low as 10-19. We observe three-dimensional excess micromotion amplitudes inside a Coulomb crystal with atomic spatial resolution and subnanometer amplitude uncertainties, and show that in ion Coulomb crystals of length 400μm and 2 mm, time-dilation shifts of In+ ions due to micromotion can be close to 1×10-19 and below 10-18, respectively. In previous ion traps, excess micromotion would have dominated the uncertainty budget for spectroscopy of even a few ions. By minimizing its contribution and providing a means to quantify it, we open up a path to precision spectroscopy in many-body ion systems, enabling entanglement-enhanced ion clocks and providing a well-controlled, strongly coupled quantum system. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,,,,,,"Ludlow, A.D., Boyd, M.M., Ye, J., Peik, E., Schmidt, P.O., Optical atomic clocks (2015) Rev.

We conducted systematic reviews of empirical studies comparing traditional and alternative approaches to instruction or assessment to examine the potential for compulsory schooling to be redesigned. This thorough scan of the scholarly horizon provides an opportunity to take the pulse from the literature published over the first one-eighth of the 21st century. Sixteen “weak signals” were identified from the literature that are discussed in the paper. This review might inform further research into current and future school designs and models, particularly in light of trends to personalise learning that are taking hold around the world. © 2019 The Authors","21st Century learning; Compulsory schooling; Foresight; Formative assessment; Future focused learning; Standardised assessment; Student-centred instruction; Systematic review; Teacher-centred instruction",,,,,,"Abbott, J., Overschooled but undereducated: How the crisis in education is jeopardizing our adolescents (2010), A&C Black; Adie, L., Learning as identity and practice through involvement in online moderation (2012) Educational Assessment, Evaluation and Accountability, 24 (1), pp. 43-56; Ahn, S., Ames, A.J., Myers, N.D., A review of meta-analyses in education: Methodological strengths and weaknesses (2012) Review of Educational Research, 82 (4), pp. 436-476; Ajiboye, J.O., Ajitoni, S., Effects of full and quasi-participatory learning strategies on Nigerian senior secondary students’ environmental knowledge: Implications for classroom practice (2008) International Journal of Environmental and Science Education, 3 (2), pp. 58-66; Al-Amoush, S., Usak, M., Erdogan, M., Markic, S., Eilks, I., Pre-service and in-service teachers’ beliefs about teaching and learning chemistry in Turkey (2013) European Journal of Teacher Education, 36 (4), pp. 464-479; Ampadu, E., Investigation into the teaching and learning of mathematics in junior secondary schools: The case of Ghana (2012), Anglia Ruskin University; Anderson, K.J., Science education and test-based accountability: Reviewing their relationship and exploring implications for future policy (2012) Science Education, 96 (1), pp. 104-129; Anderson, R., Chang, B., Mathematics course-taking in rural high schools (2011) Journal of Research in Rural Education, 26, pp. 1-10; Angrist, J., Pischke, J., Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricists’ companion (2009); Arthur, J., Waring, M., Coe, R., Hedges, L.V., Research methods and methodologies in education (2012), SAGE; Auerbach, S., Collier, S., Bringing high stakes from the classroom to the parent center: Lessons from an intervention program for immigrant families (2012) Teachers College Record, 114 (3), p. n3; Aydogdu, B., Selanik-Ay, T., Determination of teacher characteristics that support constructivist learning environments (2016) Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 63, pp. 293-310; Barlow, T., The end of’ chalk and talk’ (2012) Teaching Science, 58 (1), pp. 56-59; Bayirtepe, E., Tuzun, H., The effects of game-based learning environments on students’ achievement and self-efficacy in a computer course (2007) Hacettepe Universitesi Egitim Fakultesi Dergisi- Hacettepe University Journal of Education, 33, pp. 41-54; Beausaert, S.A., Segers, M., Wiltink, D.P., The influence of teachers’ teaching approaches on students’ learning approaches: The student perspective (2013) Educational Research, 55 (1), pp. 1-15; Black, P., Wiliam, D., The formative purpose: Assessment must first promote learning (2004) Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education, 103 (2), pp. 20-50; Blank, L.M., Hewson, P.W., A metacognitive learning cycle: A better warranty for student understanding?

Lately, with consistent advancements in the Health field, mostly brought about by e-Health startups and the interdisciplinary combination of Biology, Medicine, Computer Science, and Engineering, many of the modifications seen in big screens became a reality, albeit from a weak signal point of view and not yet mainstream solutions to Health issues. Aiming to define the scope of this research, as Sci-Fi works are abundant and take the form of movies, animes, mangas, and books, filtering all of those would be a herculean job. Hence, for this paper, only movies and animes were assessed, according to precepts established in the Methodology section. Taking our society’s progress into consideration, the aims of this work are twofold: (i) knowing to what extent there has already been real scientific progress with regard to science fiction scenarios and predictions of human body transformations; (ii) understanding the repercussions of humans undergoing such modifications applied to several fields, such as Economics, Sociology and Ethics, pinpointing scenarios that should be discussed in preparation for future changes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Cyborgs; Future Wheels; Human augmentation; Science Fiction; Wetware","Health; Health issues; Human augmentation; Human bodies; Science fictions; Scientific progress; Weak signals; Wetware; Cyborgs",,,,,"Niccol, A., (1997), Gattaca; Libman, L., Williams, L., (1998) Brave New World; Kamiyama, K., (2002) Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex; Blomkamp, N., (2013), Elysium; Villeneuve, D., (2017) Blade Runner, p. 2049; Martins, A., Rincon, P., (2014) Paraplegic in Robotic Suit Kicks off World Cup, , BBC News; Can Prosthetics Outperform Real Limbs?

Then, we analyse the sollicitation of experts in an exploration context on the basis of two case studies, with the framework of the Deweyian inquiry (Dewey, 1938/1993).

Underlying structures of a specific future scenario were revealed utilising the simplified VSTEEP. The interdisciplinary nature of the work allowed for inclusion of theories from both sociology and psychology to provide a holistic view of the evolution of consciousness. Firstly, the concept of neo-collectivist consciousness, as the next stage of human evolution, was evaluated and found to be comparable and perhaps more elegant than some established complex theories of human consciousness. Consequently, it was considered compatible with the newly developed Holarchic Evolutionary Model (HEM). As a holon, neo-collectivism not only fits into, but also validates the HEM holarchy. The characteristics of this consciousness belong to the middle - ‘green’ holon of HEM. From the macrohistory perspective this paper postulates that the current Western mindset is moving from the yellow to the green holon, with the ‘green’ neo-collectivist values already presenting as weak signals in several segments of society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Collectivism; Holarchy; Macrohistory; Neo-collectivist consciousness; Sociocultural evolution; Systems theory",,,,,,"Andersson, C., Tornberg, A., Tornberg, P., An evolutionary developmental approach to cultural evolution (2014) Current Anthropology, 55 (2), pp. 154-174; Barber, M., An hypothesis of values systems as foresight frameworks (2006) Looking up feeling good, , http://www.lookingupfeelinggood.com/uploads/Values_Systems_as_Foresight_Frameworks_2006.pdf, Accessed 29 September 2018; Barber, M., Understanding the scanning framework (2006), http://www.lufg.com.au/files/media/Understanding_the_Scanning_Framework.pdf, Accessed 20 November 2013; Barrett, R., The metrics of human consciousness (2015), Fulfilling Books London; Bauwens, M., Blueprint for P2P society: The partner state & ethical economy (2012), https://www.shareable.net/blog/blueprint-for-p2p-society-the-partner-state-ethical-economy, Accessed 15 October 2018; Beck, D., Stages of social development (2012) Spiral dynamics integral, , http://www.spiraldynamics.net/DrDonBeck/essays/stages_of_social_development.htm, Accessed 10 January 2015; Beck, D.E., Cowan, C.C., Spiral dynamics: Mastering values, leadership, and change (2006), Blackwell Publishing Malden, USA; Benson, T.W., Snee, B.J., (2015) Michael Moore and the rhetoric of documentary, , Southern Illinois University Press Carbondale; Botta, M., Evolution of the slow living concept within the models of sustainable communities (2016) Futures, 80, pp. 3-16. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328715001676, Retrieved from; Botta, M., Neo-collectivist consciousness as a driver of transformative sociocultural change (2016) Journal of Futures Studies, 21 (2), pp. 51-70. , http://jfsdigital.org/2016-2/vol-21-no-2-dec-2016/articles/neo-collectivist-consciousness-as-a-driver-of-transformative-sociocultural-change/, Accessed 29 September 2018; Botta, M., Abbasi, A., Armed conflict versus global sustainable development as functions of social change (2015) Journal of Futures Studies, 19 (4), pp. 51-72. , http://jfsdigital.org/2015-2/vol-19-no-4-june-2015/articles/armed-conflict-versus-global-sustainable-development-as-functions-of-social-change/, Accessed 29 September 2018; Boulding, E., Women's movement and social transformation (1995) The future: Images and processes, , E.

Current methods dealing with those risks are confronted with the problems of being primarily based on past data and experience, neglecting the need for objectivity, focusing on the short-term future and disregarding the interconnectedness of different financial risk categories. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review of risk governance, financial risk management and open foresight was executed to conceptualize solutions to the mentioned-above problems. Findings: Collaborative financial risk assessment (CFRA) is a promising approach in financial risk governance with respect to overcoming said problems. It is a method of risk identification and assessment, which combines aspects of “open foresight” and the financial risk management and governance literature. CFRA is characterized as bringing together members of different companies in trying to detect weak signals and trends to gain knowledge about the future, which helps companies to reduce financial risks and increase the chance of gaining economic value. By overcoming organizational boundaries, individual companies may gain the knowledge they would probably not have without CFRA and achieve a competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications: A conceptual paper like the one at hand wants empirical proof. Therefore, the authors developed a research agenda in the form of five propositions for further research. Originality/value: This paper discusses the existing problems of financial risk identification and assessment methods. It contributes to the existing literature by proposing CFRA as a solution to those problems and adding a new perspective to financial risk governance. © 2019, Thomas Michael Brunner-Kirchmair and Melanie Wiener.","Financial risks; Open foresight; Risk governance; Risk management",,,,,,"Andersen, P.D., Borup, M., Foresight and strategy in national research councils and research programmes (2009) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 21 (8), pp. 917-932; Asselt, M.B.A., Renn, O., Risk governance (2011) Journal of Risk Research, 14 (4), pp. 431-449; Atkins, D., Drennan, L., Bates, I., (2006) Reputational Risk: A Question of Trust, , Global Professional Publishing, London; Aven, T., Risk assessment and risk management: review of recent advances on their foundation (2016) European Journal of Operational Research, 253 (1), pp. 1-13; Ayyagari, M., Beck, T., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Small and medium enterprises across the globe (2007) Small Business Economics, 29 (4), pp. 415-434; Bakker, A.B., Strategic and proactive approaches to work engagement (2017) Organizational Dynamics, 46 (2), pp. 67-75; (2001) Working paper on the regulatory treatment of operational risk, , working paper, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Bank for International Settlements, Basel, September; Baum, J.A.C., Cowan, R., Jonard, N., Network-independent partner selection and the evolution of innovation networks (2010) Management Science, 56 (11), pp. 2094-2110; Beasley, M.S., Frigo, M.L., (2007) Strategic risk management: creating and protecting value, pp. 25-31/53. , Strategic Finance; Bell, W., (2009) Foundations of Future Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, Human Science for a New Era Volume 1, , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick/London; Bénabou, R., Groupthink: collective delusions in organizations and markets (2013) The Review of Economic Studies, 80 (2), pp. 429-462; Bergman, J., Jantunen, A., Saksa, J.-M., Enabling open innovation process through interactive methods: scenarios and group decision support systems (2009) International Journal of Innovation Management, 13 (1), pp. 139-156; Best, P., (1998) Implementing Value at Risk, , Wiley and Sons, Hoboken; Best, J., The limits of financial risk management: or what we didn’t learn from the Asian crisis (2010) New Political Economy, 15 (1), pp. 29-49; Bharwani, A., Kline, T., Patterson, M., A stakeholder-based approach to leadership development training: the case of medical education in Canada (2017) International Journal of Training and Development, 21 (3), pp. 211-223; Boe-Lillegraven, S., Monterde, S., Exploring the cognitive value of technology fore-sight: the case of the cisco technology radar (2015) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 101, pp. 62-82; Boer, H., During, W.E., Innovation, what innovation?

A small molecule photosensitiser, DC473, has been designed to be both highly fluorescent and to exhibit a strong Raman signal in the cell-silent region of the Raman spectrum due to a diphenylacetylene structure. DC473 has been utilised to perform a range of novel tandem fluorescence and Raman (fluoRaman) imaging experiments, enabling a thorough examination of the compound's cellular localisation, exemplified in colorectal cancer cells (SW480). This multifunctional fluoRaman imaging modality revealed the presence of the compound in lipid droplets and only a weak signal in the cytosol, by both Raman and fluorescence imaging. In addition, Raman microscopy detected the compound in a cell compartment we labelled as the nucleolus, whereas fluorescence microscopy did not detect the fluoRaman probe due to solvatochromatic effects in a local polar environment. This last finding was only possible with the use of tandem confocal Raman and fluorescence methods. By following the approach detailed herein, incorporation of strong Raman functional groups into fluorophores can enable a plethora of fluoRaman experiments, shedding further light on potential drug compound's cellular behaviour and biological activity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"cinnamic acid derivative; fluorescent dye; photosensitizing agent; quinoline derivative; chemistry; confocal microscopy; fluorescence; human; metabolism; procedures; Raman spectrometry; spectrofluorometry; synthesis; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cinnamates; Fluorescence; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Microscopy, Confocal; Photosensitizing Agents; Quinolines; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Spectrum Analysis, Raman",,"Cinnamates; Fluorescent Dyes; Photosensitizing Agents; Quinolines",,,"Shashkova, S., Leake, M.C., (2017) Biosci.

Machine learning techniques, including support vector machine (SVM) and Decision Trees, are applied to the identification of saturated, zero, and weak signals of the ECEI raw data. As a result, the burden of data analysis is reduced, and the classification accuracy is improved. Proper training sets are sampled using the massive raw ECEI data from the EAST tokamak. The optimal window size of temporal signals, the kernel function, and other model parameters are obtained by the model training. Five-fold cross-validation (CV) is applied during modeling and an external testing set is employed to validate the prediction performance of models. The average recall rates on CV sets of saturated, zero, and weak signals are 95.9%, 96.72%, and 100%, respectively, which prove the accuracy of this procedure. Random Forest, as a comparative method, is also employed to deal with the same data sets. The average recall rates on CV sets of saturated, zero, and weak signals performed by Random Forest are 95.9%, 96.72%, and 95.88%. Our method has been proved to outperform Random Forest with small data sets. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.","Analysis and statistical methods; Data processing methods","Artificial intelligence; Cyclotrons; Decision trees; Electron cyclotron resonance; Electron emission; Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Tokamak devices; Classification accuracy; Comparative methods; Data processing methods; Electron cyclotron emission imaging; Machine learning techniques; Optimal window size; Prediction performance; Temporal signals; Data handling",,,,,"Gao, B.X., The electron cyclotron emission imaging system on EAST with continuous large observation area (2018) JINST, 13 (2), p.

The first one pursues the opening and specialization characterizing the long-term evolution of the last 50 years of most French agricultural regions, while the second assumes a shift, already perceptible through weak signals, towards more autonomy at the farm and regional scales, a reconnection of crop and livestock farming and a more frugal human diet. A procedure is proposed to translate these qualitative narratives into a quantitative description of the corresponding nutrient fluxes using the GRAFS (Generalized Representation of Agro-Food Systems) methodology, thus allowing a comprehensive exploration of the agronomical and environmental performance of these two scenarios. The results show that the pursuit of the opening and specialization of French agriculture, even complying with regulations regarding reasoned fertilization, would result in considerable environmental burdens namely in terms of water pollution. The scenario generalizing organic farming practices, reconnection of crop and livestock farming systems and a demitarian human diet makes it possible to meet the future national food demand while still exporting significant amounts of cereals to the international market and ensuring better groundwater quality in most French regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural specialization; Agro-food system; Demitarian diet; GRAFS; Organic farming; Prospective scenarios","Crops; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Groundwater; International trade; Water pollution; Water quality; Agricultural specialization; Agro foods; GRAFS; Organic farming; Prospective scenarios; Long Term Evolution (LTE); ground water; autonomy; cereal; cropping practice; diet; livestock farming; organic farming; scenario analysis; agricultural procedures; agro food system; agronomy; Article; cereal; controlled study; crop production; fertilization; food availability; food industry; France; livestock; nonhuman; organic farming; priority journal; prospective study; water pollution; water quality; France",,,,,"Anglade, J., Billen, G., Makridis, T., Garnier, J., Puech, T., et Tittel, C., Nitrogen soil surface balance of organic vs conventional cash crop farming in the Seine watershed (2015) Agric.

Aiming to define the scope of this research, as Sci-Fi works are abundant and take the form of movies, animes, mangas, and books, filtering all of those would be a herculean job. Hence, for this paper, only movies and animes were assessed, according to precepts established in the Methodology section. Taking our society’s progress into consideration, the aims of this work are twofold: (i) knowing to what extent there has already been real scientific progress with regard to science fiction scenarios and predictions of human body transformations; (ii) understanding the repercussions of humans undergoing such modifications applied to several fields, such as Economics, Sociology and Ethics, pinpointing scenarios that should be discussed in preparation for future changes. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Cyborgs; Future wheels; Human augmentation; Science fiction; Wetware",,,,,,"America, P., Rommes, E., Obbink, H., (2004) Multi-View Variation Modeling for Scenario Analysis, pp. 44-65. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24667-1_5, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Andersen, R.A., Musallam, S., Pesaran, B., Selecting the signals for a brain– machine interface (2004) Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 14 (6), pp. 720-726. , https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CONB.2004.10.005; Astor, M., Microchip Implants for Employees?

Smart factories need to develop effective managerial early warning systems to identify and respond to subtle threats or opportunities, i.e. weak signals, in order to adapt to an ever-changing environment in a timely manner and thus gain or maintain a competitive advantage on the market. These factories need to develop and implement a several-stage early warning system that is specific to their industry. The aim of our study is, with the help of semi-structured group interviews, to examine which stages of a managerial early warning system are present in the case of a global innovative supplier in the automotive industry. As such, a four-stage managerial early warning system model for a knowledge-based automotive smart factory is proposed, in which aggregate activities and management decision-making strategies are defined for each stage, with the importance of intuition being taken into consideration. We found that managers rely on intuition and extensive analysis for satisficing strategies and teamwork for optimizing strategies, when using their managerial early warning system. © 2018, Editura Cefin.","Best practice;

The bibliometric analysis is based on “Tools for Innovation Monitoring” (TIM), a new software code developed by the Joint Research Centre. With this text-mining software a set of relevant keywords is extracted through frequency analysis from a corpus of pertinent scientific publications. Keywords obtained by quantitative analysis by TIM are tested against results from qualitative cognitive analysis by an international panel of PV technology experts by means of a set of proposed indicators. The technologies identified by the PV experts are well represented amongst the most frequently occurring (highest ranked) keywords retrieved by TIM. The more salient keywords tend to correspond to the relatively more established technologies such as dye sensitised solar cells, organic PV and more recently-developed technologies such as perovskites. These high rated/developed keywords/technologies can be relatively straightforwardly detected through bibliometric analysis. Contrary to that, keywords designating the most emerging technologies like ferroelectric PV, hot carriers and multiple exciton generation solar cells tend to occur much less frequently and therefore provide weaker signals. These weak signals can be important in foresight. © 2018 The Authors","Bibliometrics; Emerging technologies; Horizon scanning; Photovoltaics; Policy support; Technology mining","Data mining; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Excitons; Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; Solar power generation; Bibliometrics; Emerging technologies; Horizon scanning; Photovoltaics; Policy support; Solar cells",,,,,"European Commission, Communication from the commission to the European parliament, the council, the European economic and social committee and the committee of the regions (2017) Build.

However, it is an under-researched area within the context of smart factories. For the purpose of the study, semi-structured group interviews were used to investigate how managers at a smart factory, a highly innovative global supplier in the automotive industry sense weak signals, perceive the role of intuition, smart systems and business model adjustments. The results of the study show that managers perceive early warning systems as highly important for timely response to development changes and that both smart systems and intuition play an essential role in detecting and responding to weak signals. Based on this study, we propose a managerial early warning system model with four stages, namely, identifying, screening, appraising and responding to weak signs, within the context of a smart factory. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","behavioral economics;

Different from existing research efforts that either only deal with undirected graphs or circumvent directionality by means of symmetrization, we propose a novel random walk approach on directed graphs using absorbing Markov chains, which can be regarded as maximizing the accumulated expected number of visits from the unlabeled transient states. Our algorithm is simple, easy to implement, and works with large-scale graphs on binary, multiclass, and multi-label prediction problems. Moreover, it is capable of preserving the graph structure even when the input graph is sparse and changes over time, as well as retaining weak signals presented in the directed edges. We present its intimate connections to a number of existing methods, including graph kernels, graph Laplacian based methods, and spanning forest of graphs. Its computational complexity and the generalization error are also studied. Empirically, our algorithm is evaluated on a wide range of applications, where it has shown to perform competitively comparing to a suite of state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm is shown to work exceptionally well with large sparse directed graphs with e.g., millions of nodes and tens of millions of edges, where it significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

This article used a hybrid methodology to identify and learn from the pioneers of renewable energy around the world. First, weak signals and emerging issues were identified to craft socio-cultural scenarios, which describe how societies could change, while adopting high shares of renewable energy. Four transformative scenarios ""Radical Startups"", ""Value-Driven Techemoths"", ""Green Do-It- Yourself Engineers"" and ""New Consciousness"" until the year 2050 were constructed. Pioneer analysis was then used to identify scenario-relevant pioneers in case study countries. The findings of an international expert survey describe present pioneers who are leading ecological lifestyles and the adoption of renewable energy technologies. The findings can be used to think of leverage points for systemic change. The article finds pioneer analysis as a useful method to obtain foresight knowledge of anticipated transformations. © 2018 Journal of Futures Studies.","Pioneer analysis; Renewable energy; Scenario; Solar; Transformation; Weak signals; Wind",,,,,,"Abson, D.J., Fischer, J., Leventon, J., Newig, J., Schomerus, T., Vilsmaier, U., Leverage points for sustainability transformation (2016) Ambio: A Journal of the Human Environment, 46 (1), pp. 30-39; Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, 46, pp. 23-40; Barasa, M., Bogdanov, D., Ayobami, S.O., Breyer, C., A cost optimal resolution for Sub-Saharan Africa powered by 100% renewables in 2030 (2018) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 92, pp. 440-457. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.110; Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of Futures Studies, 1. , Human Science for a New Era.

Accessed 5 Aug 2017] predicted that the world would face the Fourth Industrial Revolution which means innovative changes through convergence of cutting-edge information and communications technologies (ICTs) such as artificial intelligence, IoT, big data and cloud computing with conventional industries. It was forecasted that such innovation would take place across all industries and services. In particular, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has paid attention to changes in conventional traditional industries. The weak signal analysis is a method which can detect the sign of future changes at an early stage. A weak signal is defined as an advanced indicator in such changes. Therefore, its search and monitoring can be an early warning on threat and great opportunity to be prepared. To overcome the limitation of future prediction which is mostly dependent upon an expert group's intuitive judgment, this study attempted to investigate the weak signal of convergence among industries, using knowledge structure based approaches. As new products and services can lead to convergence between industries, research data has gathered information on the products and services of global listed companies which have been established for the past 11 years. For comparative analysis, they were grouped every 5 years, and product and service trends were compared. And we detected weak signals of convergence with different industries and noticed the changes of existing industries. Historically, the convergence of industries is mainly discussed in relation to science and technology-led industries, so the industrial field that has been studied has chosen Korea's growth engine industries, a high-tech science and technology industries. © The Author(s).","Convergence trend; Global listed companies; Growth engine industry; Sharing economy; Weak signal",,,,,,"(2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/InnovationStrategy.pdf, The White House.

To alleviate drawbacks related to the use of observed species distributions, we introduce a novel approach to separate the effects of climate change and land use change, the latter split into fragmentation, agricultural intensification and reforestation. This approach, coined the Attribute Importance Analysis (AIA), uses the ability of species attributes to explain population declines. Through the a priori association between attributes and individual drivers, the relative importance of the drivers in causing the species decline can be assessed. We tested this approach on the population decline of vertebrate, insect, vascular plant, and fungi species in the Netherlands since the 1950s. Fragmentation was clearly the strongest driver of species decline for vertebrates and plants, and this may also be true for insects. For fungi, climate change seems the only driver. We found a weak signal of the importance of agricultural intensification for the decline of vertebrates only. We ascribe this unexpected low importance of agricultural intensification to our partitioning of agricultural effects into fragmentation and intensification. Our generic approach can offer valuable quantitative information on the relative importance of drivers that change local community composition without the need for spatial explicit information. Without data on temporal trends in drivers, including local climate and land use change, accurate information on species decline, species attribute values and association of attributes with drivers can give insights into the causes of species decline, which, in turn, can be used to adapt nature management accordingly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural intensification; Biodiversity; Climate change; Decision trees; Fragmentation; Reforestation","agricultural intensification; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; community composition; decision support system; fungus; insect; land use change; population decline; population distribution; reforestation; temporal variation; vascular plant; vertebrate; Netherlands; Fungi; Hexapoda; Tracheophyta; Vertebrata",,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Model Based Inference in the Life Sciences.

Here we assess whether interspecific variation in higher-order aspects of female macaque (genus: Macaca) dominance and grooming social structure show phylogenetic signals, that is, greater similarity among more closely-related species. We use a social network approach to describe higher-order characteristics of social structure, based on both direct interactions and secondary pathways that connect group members. We also ask whether network traits covary with each other, with species-typical social style grades, and/or with sociodemographic characteristics, specifically group size, sex-ratio, and current living condition (captive vs. free-living). We assembled 34–38 datasets of female-female dyadic aggression and allogrooming among captive and free-living macaques representing 10 species. We calculated dominance (transitivity, certainty), and grooming (centrality coefficient, Newman's modularity, clustering coefficient) network traits as aspects of social structure. Computations of K statistics and randomization tests on multiple phylogenies revealed moderate-strong phylogenetic signals in dominance traits, but moderate-weak signals in grooming traits. GLMMs showed that grooming traits did not covary with dominance traits and/or social style grade. Rather, modularity and clustering coefficient, but not centrality coefficient, were strongly predicted by group size and current living condition. Specifically, larger groups showed more modular networks with sparsely-connected clusters than smaller groups. Further, this effect was independent of variation in living condition, and/or sampling effort. In summary, our results reveal that female dominance networks were more phylogenetically conserved across macaque species than grooming networks, which were more labile to sociodemographic factors. Such findings narrow down the processes that influence interspecific variation in two core aspects of macaque social structure. Future directions should include using phylogeographic approaches, and addressing challenges in examining the effects of socioecological factors on primate social structure. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","group size; macaques; phylogenetic signals; social networks; social style","adaptation; aggression; ancestry; grooming; group size; interspecific variation; phylogenetics; phylogeny; phylogeography; primate; social network; social structure; Macaca; Primates; aggression; animal; animal behavior; classification; female; grooming; Macaca; male; psychology; sex ratio; social behavior; social dominance; wild animal; Aggression; Animals; Animals, Wild; Behavior, Animal; Female; Grooming; Macaca; Male; Sex Ratio; Social Behavior; Social Dominance",,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-266; Arnold, C., Matthews, L.J., Nunn, C.L., The 10kTrees website: A new online resource for primate phylogeny (2010) Evolutionary Anthropology, 19, pp. 114-118; Balasubramaniam, K.N., Beisner, B.A., Vandeleest, J., Atwill, E.R., McCowan, B., Social buffering and contact transmission: Network connections have beneficial and detrimental effects on Shigella infection risk among captive rhesus macaques (2016) PeerJ, 4; Balasubramaniam, K.N., Berman, C.M., Ogawa, H., Li, J., Using biological markets principles to examine patterns of grooming exchange in Macaca thibetana (2011) American Journal of Primatology, 73 (12), pp. 1269-1279; Balasubramaniam, K.N., Dittmar, K., Berman, C.M., Butovskaya, M., Cooper, M.A., Majolo, B., de Waal, F.B.M., Hierarchical steepness and phylogenetic models: Phylogenetic signals in Macaca (2012) Animal Behaviour, 83, pp. 1207-1218; Balasubramaniam, K.N., Dittmar, K., Berman, C.M., Butovskaya, M., Cooper, M.A., Majolo, B., De Waal, F.B.M., Hierarchical steepness, counter-aggression, and macaque social style scale (2012) American Journal of Primatology, 74, pp. 915-925; Balasubramaniam, K.N., Dunayer, E.S., Gilhooly, L.J., Rosenfield, K.A., Berman, C.M., Group size, contest competition, and social structure in Cayo Santiago rhesus macaques (2014) Behaviour, 151, pp. 1759-1798; Barton, R.A., Bryne, R.W., Whiten, A., Ecology, feeding competition and social structure in baboons (1996) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 38, pp. 321-329; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Christensen, R.H.B., Singmann, H., Green, P., (2016) Linear mixed-effects models using 'eigen' and S4, , https://github.com/lme4/lme4/http://lme4.r-forge.r-project.org/, Retrieved from; Berman, C.M., Thierry, B., Variation in kin bias: species differences and time constraints in macaques (2010) Behaviour, 147 (13), pp. 1863-1887; Blomberg, S.P., Garland, T., Ives, A., Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: Behavioral traits are more labile (2003) Evolution, 57, pp. 717-745; Boinski, S., The social organizations of squirrel monkeys: Implications for ecological models of social evolution (1999) Evolutionary Anthropology, 8, pp. 101-112; Borgeaud, C., Sosa, S., Bshary, R., Sueur, C., van de Waal, E., Intergroup variation of social relationships in wild vervet monkeys: A dynamic network approach (2016) Frontiers in Psychology, p. 915; Brent, L.J.N., Lehmann, J., Ramos-Fernandez, G., Social network analysis in the study of nonhuman primates: A historical perspective (2011) American Journal of Primatology, 73 (8), pp. 720-730; Brent, L.J.N., Semple, S., Dubuc, C., Heistermann, M., MacLarnon, A., Social capital and physiological stress levels in adult female rhesus macaques (2010) Physiology & Behavior, 102, pp. 76-83; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection andMultimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , 2nd edn, Berlin, Springer; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., Huyvaert, K.P., AIC model selection and multimodel inference in behavioral ecology: Some background, observations, and comparisons (2011) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 65, pp. 23-35; Butovskaya, M., Kozintsev, A., Welker, C., Grooming and social rank by birth: The case of Macaca fascicularis (1995) Folia Primatologica, 65, pp. 30-33; Capitanio, J.P., Personality dimensions in adult male rhesus macaques: Prediction of behaviors across time and situation (1999) American Journal of Primatology, 47, pp. 299-320; Castles, D.L., Aureli, F., de Waal, F.B.M., Variation in conciliatory tendency and relationship quality across groups of pigtailed macaques (1996) Animal Behaviour, 52, pp. 389-403; Chan, L.K.W., Phylogenetic interpretations of primate socioecology: With special reference to social and ecological diversity in Macaca (1996) Phylogenies and the comparative method in animal behaviour, pp. 324-360. , In, E.

However, periodic crises have aroused consumer anxiety and contributed to a general lack of confidence in the agro-industrial system. The diverse nature of these crises increases governments’ and industry difficulties in predicting and tackling them. This book addresses the relations between risk and food theoretically and empirically through case studies from Japan and China. Part I of the book examines the interaction between theoretical aspects and decision-making. The book theorizes the links between food and risk and analyses the decision-making process in light of risks and governance. The relationship between food risks, governance systems and economic decisions is assessed to explore ideas such as the “pact of nutrition” and the theory of weak signals. Part II examines case studies from China and Japan in the aftermaths of recent crises such as the milk powder scandal in China and food safety following the Fukushima nuclear accident and tsunami in Japan. This book will be an important resource for scholars, academics and policy-makers in the fields of sociology, economics, food studies, Chinese studies and Japanese studies and theories of risks and safety. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Louis Augustin-Jean and Jean-Pierre Poulain.",,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,,,,,9781351714488; 9781138897656,,,"English","Risk and Food Saf. in China and Japan: Theoretical Perspectives and Empir.

In that context, it is therefore necessary to improve listening methods for “weak signals” likely to anticipate the understanding of crises. To do this, Poulain proposes the notion of “concern” to explore the sources of anxiety that lie in the shadow of the hierarchy of risks resulting from the classical approach. On one hand, the “real” risks that affect the health of populations are measurable in terms of mortality or morbidity; on the other hand, the “other” risks are more qualitative and not arbitrable by science. The use of “concerns” accepts the idea that the consumers’ gazes are not reducible to the problem of perception. It is a way to recognize that the social dimensions of risk are legitimate and to give to the eaters their “majority”. Finally, one should accept the idea that public actions aim not only to manage risk, but must also look for the conditions for trust. In this perspective, risk management is based on a tripod: risk evaluation by expertise, analysis of perceptions and consideration of “concerns” of eaters and citizens. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Louis Augustin-Jean and Jean-Pierre Poulain.",,,,,,,"Adam, B., Berkhout, F., Dyson, T., Grove-White, R., Marsden, T., O’Riordan, T., Scoones, I., Wynne, B., (1999) The Politics of GM Food: Risk, Science and Public Trust, , ESRC Global Environmental Change Programme, Special Briefing 5, Brighton, Sussex: University of Sussex; Ansoff, H.I., Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Beardsworth, A., The Management of Food Ambivalence: Erosion and Reconstruction?

The tool was set to assist Top Management's decision making from risk trends and to identify situations displaying areas of concern. While the first dashboard was composed of an exhaustive set of measurable data, its benefits were balanced by the delay and efforts spent to update it. The tool was rationalized by focusing only on two key components: the reliable data available in the Company HSE web database and the risk perception of the HSE Site Managers, responsible of HSE on site. The dashboard consists of a global risk view which summarizes the operational risk indicators and a detailed risk view per asset. A qualitative risk evaluation of numerical data was considered, capturing the cumulative effects as a combination of three simple dimensions: quantity, criticality and trend. Four operational risk indicators cover the incidents recorded, with 3 different viewpoints (human consequences, high potential incidents and loss of primary containment) and the downgraded situations. The risk perception of the HSE Site Manager is built through three major drivers of asset integrity: people, plant and processes. It is a valuable soft indicator, often complementary from the data analysis. It captures all the weak signals from the sites which might not be reflected within all the trends of available data. The display with colored icons (green, orange and red) gives an immediate perception of the risk. It supports the Top Management to check if the appropriate corrective actions are undertaken by the operational entities or at least requesting additional risk mitigations on the identified red warnings. It also provides a qualitative means to analyze which parameter of 'People, Plant & Processes' needs to be reinforced. © 2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

However, it has been shown that only a minority of exposed people develops MPM. In fact, the incidence among professionally exposed workers was shown to vary between 0.5% and 18.0%. Various hints suggested that other important cofactors could play a role, in particular the genetic susceptibility. Impressive is the case of Cappadocians families exposed to erionite and affected by an ""epidemic"" of MPM with about half of the inhabitants dying for the disease. However, no results for a ""Cappadocia"" gene of susceptibility to MPM have been obtained yet and more studies are needed. Among asbestos-exposed workers, several studies reported familial cases of MPM, suggesting that heredity could be important in the tumor development. However, large studies on familial clusters showed only weak increased risks that could be attributable also to indirect exposures in a contaminated household. Moreover, the risk of developing MPM is increased of a limited extent among people exposed to asbestos with a positive history of familial cancers. A particular is represented by carriers of germline mutations within BAP1 gene. In families and in animal models, mutations within BAP1 are strongly predisposing to develop MPM. However, also other types of cancer (such as uveal melanoma) are present, thus BAP1 mutations are considered as responsible for a hereditary form of a multi-cancer syndrome. In any case, among sporadic MPM, the prevalence of germline BAP1 mutations is negligible. Finally, genetic studies highlighted the presence of low-risk susceptibility alleles, such as those within XRCC3, NAT2 or GSTM1. Two different genome-wide association studies could not find positive associations reaching the genome-wide statistical significance threshold, however, both were concordant in showing a weak signal within the SDK1 gene region. Overall, it could be concluded that, as for other types of sporadic cancers, the susceptibility to develop MPM following asbestos exposure is modulated moderately by the individual genetic background. Further studies on larger series could help in a better characterization of more genes predisposing to MPM, being this tumor a rare disease. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.","Asbestos; Genetic susceptibility;

In this paper, the applicability of weak signals and wild cards is experimented in a case of a highly reliable and conservative sector, water and sanitation services. The aim is to explore an approach suitable for water utilities. The paper discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches to weak signals and wild cards, and reflects these in relation to the chosen approach. It is argued that the process of weak signals and wild cards can serve as a communication and reflection exercise for an organisation like a water utility. Furthermore, incorporating weak signals and wild cards can be an essential part in futures thinking, challenge prevailing mental models, and make systems more open to sense and learn from their environment. It is recommended for water utilities to apply a loose approach on weak signals and wild cards and embed it as a part of their organisational culture. However, it should be remembered that the approach should always be chosen to match the overall objectives and context. © 2017, The Author(s).","Water and sanitation services; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Hiltunen, E., (2010) Weak signals in organizational futures learning, , Aalto University School of Economics, Dissertation; Miller, R., Rossel, P., Jorgensen, U., Future studies and weak signals: a critical survey (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 195-197; Holopainen, M., Toivonen, M., Weak signals: Ansoff today (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 198-205; Mendonça, S., Cardoso, G., Caraça, J., The strategic strength of weak signal analysis (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 218-228; Rossel, P., Early detection, warnings, weak signals and seeds of change: a turbulent domain of futures studies (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 229-239; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The big picture – trends, drivers, wild cards, discontinuities and weak signals (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 292-312; Cevolini, A., The strongness of weak signals: self-reference and paradox in anticipatory systems (2016) Eur J Futures res, 4, pp. 1-13; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Slaughter, R.A., A new framework for environmental scanning (1999) Foresight, 1, pp. 441-451; Popper, R., Foresight methodology (2008) The Handbook of technology foresight: concepts and practice, pp. 44-88. , Georghiou L, Harper JC, Keenan M, Miles I, Popper R, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision making (2009) Technol Anal Strateg, 21, pp. 307-320; Pieper, K.J., Tang, M., Edwards, M.A., Flint water crisis caused by interrupted corrosion control: investigating ""ground zero"" home (2017) Environmental Science & Technology, 51, p. 2007; Saritas, O., Proskuryakova, L., Water resources – an analysis of trends, weak signals and wild cards with implications for Russia (2017) Foresight, 19, pp. 152-173; Nafday, A.M., Strategies for managing the consequences of black swan events (2009) Leader Manag Eng, 9, pp. 191-197; Kahneman, D., (2011) Thinking, fast and slow, , Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York; Taleb, N.N., (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, , Random House, New York; Heino, O.A., Takala, A.J., Katko, T.S., Challenges to Finnish water and wastewater services in the next 20–30 years (2011) E-Water, 1, pp. 1-20; Dominguez, D., (2008) Handling future uncertainty - strategic planning for the infrastructure sector, , Dissertation, ETH Zurich; Meadows, D.H., Wright, D., (2008) Thinking in systems: a primer, , Chelsea Green, White River Junction; Rognerud, I., Fonseca, C., van der, K.A., Moriarty, P., (2016) IRC trends analysis, 2016–2025; Ravetz, J., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2011) ERA toolkit: applications of wild cards and weak signals to the grand challenges & thematic priorities of the European research area, , Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, University of Manchester; Swyngedouw, E., (2004) Social power and the urbanization of water: flows of power, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Castro, J.E., Systemic conditions and public policy in the water and sanitation sector (2009) Water and sanitation services, pp. 19-37. , Castro JE, Heller L, (eds), Earthscan, London; Slaughter, R.A., From forecasting and scenarios to social construction: changing methodological paradigms in futures studies (2002) Foresight, 4, pp. 26-31; Miles, I., Harper, J.C., Georghiou, L., Keenan, M., Popper, R., The many faces of foresight (2008) The Handbook of technology foresight: concepts and practice, pp. 3-23. , Georghiou L, Harper JC, Keenan M, Miles I, Popper R, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting strategic management, , Prentice/Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Könnölä, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., van Rij, V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39, pp. 208-221; Moijanen, M., Heikot signaalit tulevaisuuden tutkimuksessa.

The world is a complex system and the rapid change among its sub-systems builds up pressure for any efforts to anticipate change and shape the processes of transformation. Surprise is an intrinsic aspect of change, in particular when it takes place at an accelerating pace with high degrees of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity (VUCA) - or within the condition of post-normality as described by Ziauddin Sardar. Emerging technologies such as AI and renewable energy systems add to the complexity of societies, and thus to the world of VUCA and post-normality. In foresight horizon scanning has much focused on the probable or even predictable -surprise-free developments. More emphasis should be paid on systematic anticipation of wild cards and black swans, and on the analysis of weak signals. Foresight should also focus on discontinuities - broader phenomena and developments instead of single events. Energy is a complex issue. Without energy there is no life, neither biological nor economic. Taking into account the huge ecological and social costs of the present energy system, the need for a new emission-free, cost-effective, and democratised energy system is obvious. An energy transformation to reach 100% renewable energy is envisioned in four transformational neo-carbon energy scenarios. Energy is increasingly a societal and even cultural issue - above all a security issue. As regards energy security, various sudden events and surprises could play a major role. New energy systems themselves, with other new technologies, nudge the world into unknown, discontinuous directions. Therefore, we probe the resilience, anti-fragility and discontinuity of these transformational, societal energy scenarios. The results of a futures clinique where the scenarios were tested are presented. Implications of surprises for energy security, as the world increasingly seeks to move towards a renewable energy based society, are explored. © 2017, The Author(s).","Black swans; Complexity; Discontinuity; Energy security; Renewable energy; Resilience; Transformative scenarios; Turbulence; Uncertainty; Wild cards",,,,,,"Aven, T., Implications of black swans to the foundations and practice of risk assessment and management (2015) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 134, pp. 83-91; Aven, T., On the meaning of a black swan in a risk context (2013) Saf Sci, 57, pp. 44-51; Last, C., Human metasystem transition (HMST) theory (2015) J Evol Technol, 25 (1), pp. 1-16; Osti, G., Frames, organisations, and practices as social components of energy (2012) Int Rev Sociol, 22 (3), pp. 412-428; Lord, B., (2014) Art & Energy: how culture changes, , The AAM Press, Arlington; Naam, R., (2011) Smaller, cheaper, faster: Does Moore's law apply to solar cells?

However, among the fundamental concepts of copyright, it is perhaps the least suitable for the digital environment due to its technical-functional nature. Flexible, principle-oriented regulation enabling context-sensitive outcomes and balancing of interests is needed in European copyright law. In this respect, often suggested solutions such as a fair use exception or the implied licence doctrine might not create enough adaptability; whereas, a better solution would be to reform the fundamental structures of copyright law. Even though achieving any radical changes to international conventions might not be realistic, this article attempts to find an alternative approach to the concept of reproduction. Structural rather than substantive elements as substitutes for reproduction could be derived from the context of modern trademark law. Such an approach would be consistent with the existing weak signals on convergence between the branches of industrial property law and copyright. As a structural adoption, a formulation stressing the legitimate interests behind the protection and consequences of utilisation of the protected object for these interests could be used in copyright law. One possibility would be a flexible instrument by which it would be evaluated whether the utilisation of copyrighted work affects, or is liable to affect, the legitimate interests of the right holder or alternatively if the utilisation follows honest practice in the particular sector of the creative industry. © 2017, Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, Munich.","Copyright; Fair use; Honest practice; Implied licence; Legitimate interests; Reproduction",,,,,,"Alexander, I., Determining infringement in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Britain “A ticklish job (2016) Research handbook on the history of copyright law, pp. 174-194. , Alexander I, Gomez-Arostegui HT, (eds), Edward Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham; Arezzo, E., Hyperlinks and making available right in the European Union—what future for the Internet after Svensson?

The 500 μm thick wafer IREs with groove angles of 35° are significantly more transparent at long mid-IR wavelengths as compared to conventional large Si hemisphere IREs. The appeal of greater transparency is mitigated by smaller optical throughput at larger grazing angles and steeper angles of incidence at the reflecting plane that reduce the enhancement factor. Through use of the potential dependent adsorption of 4-methoxypyridine (MOP) as a test system, the microgroove IRE is shown to provide relatively strong electrochemical ATR-SEIRAS responses when the angle of incident radiation is between 50 and 55°, corresponding to refracted angles through the crystal of 40°. The higher than expected enhancement is attributed to attenuation of the reflection loss of p-polarized light and multiple reflections within the wafer-based IRE. The micromachined IREs are shown to outperform a 25 mm radius hemisphere in terms of S/N at wavenumbers less than ca. 1400 cm -1 despite the weaker signal enhancement derived from the steeper angle incident on the IRE/sample interface. The high optical transparency of the new IREs allows the spectral observation of displaced water libration bands at ca. 730 cm -1 upon solvent replacement by adsorbed MOP. The results are highly encouraging for the further development of low-cost, Si wafer-based IREs for electrochemical ATR-SEIRAS applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Costs; Infrared spectroscopy; Light absorption; Transparency; Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy; Internal reflection elements; Multiple reflections; Optical transparency; Potential-dependent; Solvent replacements; Spectral observations; Surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy; Silicon wafers",,,,,"Osawa, M., (2006) Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy, , Chalmers, J.

This paper focuses on decadal variability (periods of one to few decades) by first documenting the variability of the WCs and warm-pool convection, and their covariability since the 1960s, using in situ and satellite observations and reanalysis products. The causes for the variability and covariability are then explored using a Bayesian dynamic linear model, which can extract nonstationary effects of climate modes. The warm-pool convection exhibits apparent decadal variability, generally covarying with the Indian and Pacific Ocean WCs during winter (November-April) with enhanced convection corresponding to intensified WCs, and the Indian-Pacific WCs covary. During summer (May-October), the warm-pool convection still highly covaries with the Pacific WC but does not covary with the Indian Ocean WC, and the Indian-Pacific WCs are uncorrelated. The wintertime coherent variability results from the vital influence of ENSO decadal variation, which reduces warm-pool convection and weakens the WCs during El Niño-like conditions. During summer, while ENSO decadal variability still dominates the Pacific WC, decadal variations of ENSO, the Indian Ocean dipole, Indian summer monsoon convection, and tropical Indian Ocean SST have comparable effects on the Indian Ocean WC overall, with monsoon convection having the largest effect since the 1990s. The complex causes for the Indian Ocean WC during summer result in its poor covariability with the Pacific WC and warm-pool convection. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Cloud cover; Convection; ENSO; Teleconnections; Walker circulation; Wind stress","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Climatology; Heat convection; Lakes; Wind stress; Cloud cover; ENSO; Indian summer monsoon; Non-stationary effects; Satellite observations; Teleconnections; Tropical Indian Ocean SST; Walker circulation; Oceanography; cloud cover; convection; decadal variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; seasonal variation; teleconnection; trend analysis; Walker circulation; wind stress; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pomatiopsis californica",,,,,"Adler, R.F., The version-2 Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly precipitation analysis (1979-present) (2003) J.

However, many authors have concluded that species ranges are too dynamic to retain the historical signal of the speciation processes. We develop an approach to explore the extent to which range changes have erased the geographical signal of speciation in the current distribution of species lineages, and whether phylogenetic relationships among species and their current distributions can provide information regarding the geography of diversification. As case studies we used different lineages of aquatic Coleoptera. Location: Western Palaearctic. Methods: We first assessed the persistence of a geographical signal in the current distribution of a clade from the association between evolutionary relationships and geography using Mantel tests. We then tested two potential scenarios of diversification using bivariate plots of the geographical distance between the centroids of the species ranges and phylogenetic distances, and an assessment of the match between the observed geographical distribution and the phylogenetic topology. We used as a study system a set of 10 monophyletic lineages of water beetles with different ecological characteristics (either standing water, running water or a mixture of both habitat types). Results: Our results point to a common pattern of geographically conserved ranges where current species seem to have originated through range fragmentation of formerly more widespread species. Exclusive standing water clades showed a much weaker signal, as expected from their higher mobility, which erases the geographical signal at much shorter temporal scales. Main conclusions: Overall, our findings show that for at least some lineages it is possible to obtain strong evidence of stasis of the geographical ranges of species, as well as information regarding the diversification process, through the study of their current distributions and phylogenetic relationships. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","allopatric speciation; aquatic Coleoptera; biogeography; geographical distributions; phylogenies; species ranges","allopatry; aquatic organism; beetle; biogeography; evolutionary biology; geographical distribution; habitat type; Palearctic Region; phylogenetics; phylogeny; range expansion; speciation (biology); Coleoptera",,,,,"Abellán, P., Benetti, C.J., Angus, R.B., Ribera, I., A review of Quaternary range shifts in European aquatic Coleoptera (2011) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 20, pp. 87-100; Abellán, P., Ribera, I., Geographic location and phylogeny are the main determinants of the size of the geographical range in aquatic beetles (2011) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 11, p. 344; Abellán, P., Sánchez-Fernández, D., Picazo, F., Millán, A., Lobo, J.M., Ribera, I., Preserving the evolutionary history of freshwater biota in Iberian National Parks (2013) Biological Conservation, 162, pp. 116-126; Anderson, S., Evensen, M.K., Randomness in allopatric speciation (1978) Systematic Zoology, 27, pp. 421-430; Barraclough, T.G., Nee, S., Phylogenetics and speciation (2001) Trends in Ecololy and Evolution, 16, pp. 391-399; Barraclough, T.G., Vogler, A.P., Detecting the geographical pattern of speciation from species level phylogenies (2000) The American Naturalist, 155, pp. 419-434; Berlocher, S.H., Feder, J.L., Sympatric speciation in phytophagous insects: Moving beyond controversy (2002) Annual Reviews of Entomology, 47, pp. 773-815; Bolnick, D., Fitzpatrick, B., Sympatric speciation: Models and empirical evidence (2007) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 38, pp. 459-487; Brooks, D.R., McLennan, D.A., (1991) Phylogeny, Ecology, and Behaviour: A Research Program in Comparative Biology, , #x0026;, Chicago, Chicago University Press; Brown, J.H., Stevens, G.C., Kaufman, D.M., The geographic range: Size, shape, boundaries, and internal structure (1996) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 27, pp. 597-623; Cardillo, M., Geographic range shifts do not erase the historic signal of speciation in mammals (2015) The American Naturalist, 185, pp. 343-353; Carranza, S., Wade, E., Taxonomic revision of Algero-Tunisian Pleurodeles (Caudata: Salamandridae) using molecular and morphological data.

It is not even considering the long-Term opportunities. Therefore, the short term plans are not derived from established perspectives, they do not have sufficient grounds.

According to the movement schools of thought, a strategy can be set from the inside out in which case the organization influences the surroundings with its offer of products and / or services. Given the importance of weak signals in the definition of the strategy, the research goal is to treat the issue of pre-emptive strategy in the context of strategic decision making. An answer is provided for the following questions: (1) What is a weak signal? (2) How to tell if it is anticipative, relevant and useful for the decision makers? and (3) How to turn a weak signal in an effective anticipative clue? Based on investigator's experience in strategic consulting for small, medium and large companies, the weak and strong signals are explained and a set of criteria which are representative of their identification is presented. © 2018 by IGI Global.

In the presentation special attention is paid to new available technologies, which help in the identification process. Author notes that disruptive technologies can be double-edged sword, as cyber terrorists can use the new disruptive technologies. Author first presents background theories of terrorist profiling and identification with special attention to geographical, behavioral, and sociological aspects. In the second phase, author evaluates the potential role of emerging radical and disruptive technologies in the identification process of individual terrorists and terrorist groups. Author also presents key systemic aspects of terrorism foresight paying special attention to advanced weak signal analysis and Wild Card methodology. WE-WI-analysis (weak signal-wild card analysis) can be helpful in operational risk identification, risk assessment, and risk mitigation. Author presents various models which are relevant for terrorism foresight. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

We chose the milk market as a case study, in line with the recent call from the EU Commission for governance tools which help to better address such highly volatile markets. Furthermore, on the first of April 2015, the new Common Agricultural Policy ended quotas for milk, which led to a milk crisis in the EU. Thus, we collaborated with milk experts to get their inputs for a new model to analyse the competitive environment. Consequently, we constructed graphs to represent the major factors that affect the milk industry and the relationships between them. We obtained several network measures for this social network, such as centrality and density. Some factors appear to have the largest major influence on all the other graph elements, while others strongly interact in cliques. Any detected changes in any of these factors will automatically impact the others. Therefore, scanning ones competitive environment can allow an organisation to get an early warning to help it avoid an issue (as much as possible) and/or seize an opportunity before its competitors. We conclude that Strategic Early Warning Systems as a corporate foresight approach utilising graph theory can strengthen the governance of markets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate foresight; Graph theory; Milk market; Scanning; Scenario analysis; Strategic Early Warning System","commodity market; corporate strategy; crisis management; early warning system; European Union; governance approach; graphical method; milk; scenario analysis; France",,,,,"Organizations make strides in adoption of analytics, but struggle to capitalize on investments.

This phenomenon, known as “convergence”, leads to emerging industry segments and offers a wide array of opportunities for synergies. Against this background, a significant emphasis has been put on anticipating technology convergence as well as identifying and understanding the changing innovation patterns and industry structure associated with convergence. The timely recognition of converging technological fields enables the innovating enterprises to exert a positive influence on the changing value-chain. This paper introduces a refined methodological approach for the anticipation of converging technology areas based on the concept of knowledge flow. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to the areas of Nutraceuticals and Functional Food (NFF), Nanotechnology and Wearables. Our results indicate that the emerging technology convergence can be expressed by the concept of “weak signals”. The indices derived from the proposed approach are capable of uncovering the relationships between the individual technological sectors and provide numerical metrics to measure the presence of converging technologies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Functional food; IPC co-classification; Knowledge flow; Patent analysis; Technological convergence; Wearables","Functional food; Technology transfer; Wearable technology; Converging technologies; Emerging technologies; Knowledge flow; Methodological approach; Patent analysis; Technological convergence; Technology convergence; Wearables; Patents and inventions; food industry; industrial structure; industrial technology; innovation; knowledge; property rights; technology adoption",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

The EPR spectra of γ-irradiated strontium carbonate (SC) rods exhibit a strong EPR signal with the spectroscopic splitting g-factor 2.008 and a weak signal at g-factor 2.003. This signal increases with increasing irradiation dose. The dose-response function has a good linearity in the low dose range of 2.5–500 Gy and slight sub-linearity in the high dose range of 0.5–25 kGy. The dosimeter is nearly humidity independent in the level of 33–77% relative humidity during irradiation. The temperature coefficient of the dose-response function is 0.22% per °C in the temperature range of 20–40 °C. The rod dosimeter exhibits a maximum deviation from water equivalency by 7% in the energy range of 0.3–5 MeV. The overall uncertainty of dose determination using SC dosimeter is 5.2% and 4.54% (2σ) for low and high dose range, respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,"Carbonation; Defects; Dosimeters; Irradiation; Magnetic resonance; Paramagnetic resonance; Strontium; Temperature; Dose-response functions; Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR); Radiation induced defects; Spectroscopic splitting; Strontium carbonate; Temperature coefficient; Temperature range; Water equivalency; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; carbonic acid derivative; strontium; strontium carbonate rod; unclassified drug; Article; dosimeter; dosimetry; electron spin resonance; gamma radiation; humidity; radiation dose; radiation energy; spectroscopy; temperature",,"strontium, 7440-24-6",,,"Abdel-Fattah, A.A., El-Din, H.E., Abdel-Rehim, F., New alanine/epr dosimeter using eva copolymer/paraffin as a binder for high-dose radiation dosimetry: performance characterization (2004) Int.

The authors attribute particular attention to implication for Russia, which is relatively better positioned regarding the availability of water resources. However, the country still faces challenges related to the protection of water resources, drinking water supply, water networks, consumption patterns, water discharge, treatment and re-use. The present study aims at identification and analysis of trends, factors and uncertainties in water supply, demand, use and re-use with a particular focus on sustainability of water systems; water use by households and industry; and new water services and products. Design/methodology/approach: Research methodology in this paper involves a horizon scanning exercise for the identification of the key trends, factors and uncertainties along with the identification of weak signals of future emerging trends and wild cards in the form of future surprises, shocks and other unexpected events that may disrupt the preservation of water resources and the future of the water sector. Trends characterize broad parameters for shifts in attitudes, climate, policies and business focus over periods of several years that usually have global reach. These are usually experienced by everyone and often in similar contexts. Trends may represent threats, opportunities or a mixture of them, identified through underlying processes, possible events and other future developments. Findings: A key systemic restriction of water use for the next decades both globally and in Russia relates to competition between agriculture, energy, manufacturing and household water use. Given that the amount of renewable water resources is almost fixed and even decreases because of pollution, circular economy solutions for water use will be required. Implications of the global trends identified in the study for Russia are dependent on the overall situation with water resources in the country. Russia has sufficient water supply: the overall intake of water for drinking and economic purposes in Russia amounts to 3 per cent of the total water resources, two-thirds of which are discarded back to water bodies. At the same time, there are substantial problems associated with the extremely uneven distribution of water resources across the country, as well as high “water intensity” of the Russian GDP. The Russian water sector is currently not very attractive for investors. Moreover, it has significantly less lobbying opportunities than other infrastructure sectors, and this complicates its institutional and financial positions. Meanwhile, there have been some positive changes with regard to activities with a short pay-off period. Originality/value: The paper offers one of the first studies on the future of Russian water resources with a focus on the water supply and sanitation sector. A comprehensive approach to trends identification (not found in other studies on Russian water resources) allowed authors to identify social, technological, environmental, economic, policy and value-related global trends and uncertainties. Moreover, implications of these trends and uncertainties, as well as Russia-specific trends, were outlined. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Horizon scanning; Russia; Sustainable water systems; Water goods and services; Water resources; Water use",,,,,,"Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Foresighting for inclusive development (2016) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 1; Andersen, P.D., Rasmussen, L.B., The impact of national traditions and cultures on national foresight processes (2014) Futures, 59, pp. 5-17; Barbosa, A., Brusca, I., Governance structures and their impact on tariff levels of Brazilian water and sanitation corporations (2015) Utilities Policy, 34, pp. 94-105; Bouabid, A., Louis, G.E., Capacity factor analysis for evaluating water and sanitation infrastructure choices for developing communities (2015) Journal of Environmental Management, 161 (15), pp. 335-343; (2002) Defra’s Horizon Scanning Strategy for Science, Science Directorate, Defra Science Strategy Team, , December., Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London; Dellachiesa, A.E., Myint, A.P., Trade openness and the changing water polluting intensity patterns of ‘dirty’ and ‘clean’ industrial sectors (2016) Ecological Economics, 129, pp. 143-151; Ercin, A.E., Hoekstra, A.Y., Water footprint scenarios for 2050: a global analysis (2014) Environment International, 64 (1), pp. 71-82; Eshtawi, T., Evers, M., Tischbein, B., Diekkrüger, B., Integrated hydrologic modeling as a key for sustainable urban water resources planning (2016) Water Research, 101 (15), pp. 411-428; (2003) No global water crisis – but many developing countries will face water scarcity, , www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2003/15254-en.html, (accessed, 6 October 2016; (2011) ‘Energy-smart’ food for people and climate, , www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2454e/i2454e00.pdf, (accessed, 11 February 2015, Issue paper, FAO, Rome; Fedorov, G., (2016) When Baikal water will be more expensive than oil, Russia beyond the headlines, , https://rbth.com/politics_and_society/society/2016/02/05/when-baikal-water-will-be-more-expensive-than-oil_564923, February, (accessed, 6 October 2016; Fouial, A., Khadra, R., Daccache, A., Lamaddalena, N., Modelling the impact of climate change on pressurised irrigation distribution systems: use of a new tool for adaptation strategy implementation (2016) Biosystems Engineering, 150, pp. 182-190; Furukawa, D., (2008) A global perspective of low pressure membranes, , Final project report, National Water Research Institute; Gao, H., Wei, T., Lou, I., Yang, Z., Shen, Z., Li, Y., Water saving effect on integrated water resource management (2014) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 93 (1), pp. 50-58; Gleick, P.H., Allen, L., Christian-Smith, J., Cohen, M.J., Cooley, H., Heberger, M., Morrison, J., Schulte, P., (2011) The World’s Water Volume 7: The Biennial Report on Freshwater Resources Paperback; Grafton, R.Q., Chu, L., Kompas, T., Optimal water tariffs and supply augmentation for cost-of-service regulated water utilities (2015) Utilities Policy, 34 (1), pp. 54-62; Gu, A., Teng, F., Lv, Z., Exploring the nexus between water saving and energy conservation: insights from industry sector during the 12th Five-Year Plan period in China (2016) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 59, pp. 28-38; Guerra, K., Pellegrino, J., (2012) Investigation of low-pressure membrane performance, cleaning, and economics using a techno-economic modeling approach, , Science and Technology Program Report 174, US Department of Interior; Hoekstra, A.Y., Hung, P.Q., (2002) Virtual water trade: a quantification of virtual water flows between nations in relation to international crop trade, , Value of Water Research Report Series 11.

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, best international practice was analyzed that provided a solid basis for Russian S&T Foresight 2030 (section “Nanotechnology and new materials”). The study used a wide range of advanced Foresight methods adapted to Russian circumstances. During the Foresight study, the authors integrated “market pull” and research “technology push” approaches including both traditional methods (priority-setting, roadmaps, global challenges analysis) and relatively new approaches (horizon scanning, weak signals, wild cards, etc.). Findings: Using the methods of the Foresight, the authors identified trends with the greatest impact on the sphere of nanotechnology and new materials, promising markets, product groups and potential areas of demand for Russian innovation technologies and developments in this field. The authors assessed the state-of-the-art of the domestic research in the area of nanotechnologies and new materials to identify “white spots”, as well as parity zone and leadership, which can be the basis for integration into international alliances and positioning of Russia as a center of global technological development in this field. Originality/value: The results of applying Foresight methodology toward revelation of the most prospective S&T areas in the field of nanotechnologies and new materials can be used by a variety of stakeholders including federal and regional authorities, technology platforms and innovation and industrial clusters, leading universities and scientific organizations in formulation of their research and strategic agenda.

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors classify wildcards into three particular types which share similar character: natural wildcards, artificial wildcards (Degree 1) and artificial wildcards (Degree 2). Wildcards point to unexpected and surprising events including important results that can form watershed in the development of a specific trend. In addition, the authors present a Fuzzy TOPSIS model which can be used in various cases to prioritize a number of weak signals and put them in order, so that the most important ones are likely to yield the wildcard in the future Findings: The authors presented a classification of wildcards with the same characteristics being natural wildcards, artificial wildcards (Degree 1) and artificial wildcards (Degree 2). The authors also prioritized the weak signals to deal with the most important ones and take appropriate action in advance so as to minimize possible damages and maximize the benefits of potential wildcards in an uncertain environment. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors report on the prioritizing of weak signals by applying Fuzzy TOPSIS and classify wildcards. This is significant because, by identifying the most important weak signals, appropriate actions can be taken in the future if necessary. The paper should be of interest to readers in the area of participatory foresight. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental scanning; Futurist; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Panel of experts; Weak signals; Wildcards",,,,,,"Ansoff, I., (1982) Strategic response to turbulent environments, , Working Paper 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, Brussels; Choo, C.W., Auster, E., Environmental scanning: acquisition and use of information by managers (1993) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 28, pp. 279-314; Coffman, B., (1997) Weak signal research, part IV: evolution and growth of the weak signal to maturity, , www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrmatur.htm; Conway, M., (2010) Environmental Scanning: What Is it, How to Do It, , April., Thinking Futures; Cornish, E., The wild cards in our future (2003) The Futurist, 37 (4), p. 18; Hiltunen, E., Was it a wild card or just our blindness to gradual change (2006) Journal of Futures Studies, 11 (2), pp. 61-74; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Hiltunen, E., (2013) Foresight and Innovation: How Companies Are Coping with the Future, , Springer, Berlin; Huang, I.B., Keisler, J., Linkov, I., Multi-criteria decision analysis in environmental sciences: ten years of applications and trends (2011) Science of the Total Environment, 409 (19), pp. 3578-3594; Hwang, C.-L., Lai, Y.J., Liu, T.Y., A new approach for multiple objective decision making (1993) Computers & Operations Research, 20 (8), pp. 889-899; Hwang, C.L., Yoon, K., (2012) Multiple Attribute Decision Making: Methods and Applications a State-of-the-Art Survey, 186. , Springer Science & Business Media; Kuo, M.S., Tzeng, G.H., Huang, W.C., Group decision-making based on concepts of ideal and anti-ideal points in a fuzzy environment (2007) Mathematical and Computer Modeling, 45 (3), pp. 324-339; Lesca, H., Lesca, N., (2013) Weak Signals for Strategic Intelligence: Anticipation Tool for Managers, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; Lesca, H., Lesca, N., The subject within the field of management science: concepts and issues (2014) Strategic Decisions and Weak Signals, pp. 1-46; Mannermaa, M., (1999) Tulevaisuuden hallinta-skenaariot strategiatyöskentelyssä, , WSOY; Mendonça, S., e Cunha, M.P., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., Wild cards, weak signals and organisational improvisation (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 201-218; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management-cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, 29 (2), pp. 15-20; Moayeri, M., Shahvarani, A., Behzadi, M.H., Hosseinzadeh-Lotfi, F., Comparison of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods for math teachers selection (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (13); Moijanen, M., Heikot Signaalit Tulevaisuudentutkimuksessa (2003) Futura, 22 (4); Molitor, G.T., Molitor forecasting model: key dimensions for plotting the’patterns of change’ (2003) Journal of Future Studies, 8 (1), pp. 61-72; Nikander, I.O., Early warnings (2002) A Phenomenon in Project Management, , Helsinki University of Technology; Petersen, J.L., (1999) Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises, , National Book Network; Rockfellow, J.D., Wild cards: preparing for ‘the big one’ (1994) The Futurist, 28 (1), p. 14; Yeh, C.H., Deng, H., Pan, H., Multi-criteria analysis for dredger dispatching under uncertainty (1999) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 50 (1), pp. 35-43; Yeh, C.H., Deng, H., Chang, Y.H., Fuzzy multicriteria analysis for performance evaluation of bus companies (2000) European Journal of Operational Research, 126 (3), pp. 459-473; Yoon, K., A reconciliation among discrete compromise solutions (1987) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 38 (3), pp. 277-286; Yoon, K.P., Hwang, C.L., (1995) Multiple Attribute Decision Making: An Introduction, 104. , Sage Publications, London; Zadeh, L.A., The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning-III (1975) Information Sciences, 9 (1), pp. 43-80; Zavadskas, E.K., Zakarevicius, A., Antucheviciene, J., Evaluation of ranking accuracy in multi-criteria decisions (2006) Informatica, 17 (4), pp. 601-618; Coffman, B.S., (1997) Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution, , www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, MG Taylor Corporation","Mohammadi, M.; Futures Studies Research Center, Imam Khomeini International UniversityIran; email: mohammadi.m.982@gmail.com",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014817004

This paper aims to present results of this research. Design/methodology/approach: The study was based on a combination of technology-push and market-pull approaches that aimed not only to identify most promising science and technology (S&T) areas but also to understand how they can be realized in practice. Representatives from federal authorities, science and business were involved in the project to create future visions of technological directions; analyze grand challenges, weak signals and wild cards; and set research and development (R&D) priorities. Findings: According to results of the study, Russia has a potential for biotech sector development, although the level of R&D in the majority of areas is lagging behind that in the USA and leading EU countries. However, there are several advanced applied research areas where efforts can be focused. Among them are high-performance genomics and post-genomics research platforms, systems and structural biology, microbial metabolic engineering, plant biotechnology and microbial strains and consortia for development of symbiotic plant–microbial communities. Originality/value: Concentration of available resources of government and business on biotechnological sector development can help to find answers for challenges that Russia faces today or will face tomorrow. It will help to pick up on the current level of research activities, improve the quality of personnel training, make this area the engine of the economy and carry out the so-called new industrialization of the country, building a new, high-tech device industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bioeconomy; Biotechnologies; Foresight; Grand challenges; Innovative products; Long-term prognosis; Russia",,,,,,"Buyel, J.F., Process development strategies in plant molecular farming (2015) Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, 16 (11), pp. 966-982; Häggman, H., Raybould, A., Borem, A., Fox, T., Handley, L., Hertzberg, M., Lu, M.Z., McLean, M., Genetically engineered trees for plantation forests: key considerations for environmental risk assessment (2013) Plant Biotechnology Journal, 11 (7), pp. 785-798; Hartung, F., Schiemann, J., Precise plant breeding using new genome editing techniques: opportunities, safety and regulation in the EU (2014) Plant Journal, 78 (5), pp. 742-752; Hegde, K., Chandra, N., Sarma, S.J., Brar, S.K., Veeranki, V.D., Genetic engineering strategies for enhanced biodiesel production (2015) Molecular Biotechnology, 57 (7), pp. 606-624; Heux, S., Meynial-Salles, I., O’Donohue, M.J., Dumon, C., White biotechnology: state of the art strategies for the development of biocatalysts for biorefining (2015) Biotechnology Advances, 33 (8), pp. 1653-1670; Kilbane, J.J., II, Future applications of biotechnology to the energy industry (2016) Frontiers in Microbiology, , https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00086; Liang, P., Xu, Y., Zhang, X., Ding, C., Huang, R., Zhang, Z., Lv, J., Huang, J., CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes (2015) Protein & Cell, 6 (5), pp. 363-372; Mikova, N., Sokolova, A., Global technology trends monitoring: theoretical frameworks and best practices (2014) Foresight-Russia, 8 (4), pp. 64-83; (2016) Russia 2030: Science and Technology Foresight, , HSE, Moscow; (2016) Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects, , National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; (2015) Industrialization of Biology: A Roadmap to Accelerate the Advanced Manufacturing of Chemicals, , National Academies Press, Washington, DC; (2010) The Bioeconomy to 2030: Designing a Policy Agenda, , OECD, Paris; Pearce, D.W., Turner, R.K., (1989) Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore; Reen, F.J., Gutiérrez-Barranquero, J.A., Dobson, A.D., Adams, C., O’Gara, F., Emerging concepts promising new horizons for marine biodiscovery and synthetic biology (2015) Marine Drugs, 13 (5), pp. 2924-2954; Rossi, M., Bermudez, L., Carrari, F., Crop yield: challenges from a metabolic perspective (2015) Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 25, pp. 79-89; Siegert, M., Sitte, J., Galushko, A., Krüger, M., Starting up microbial enhanced oil recovery (2014) Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology, 142, pp. 1-94; Streltsova, E., Patent activity in biotechnology (2014) Foresight-Russia, 8 (1), pp. 52-65; (2015) Strategic Research Agenda, , Technological Platform Bioindustry and Bioresources, Moscow; (2012) State Programme for R&D development Order No̱ 2433-R of the 20th of December, 2012, , The Russian Government, Moscow; Verbeke, W., Sans, P., Van Loo, E., Challenges and prospects for consumer acceptance of cultured meat (2015) Journal of Integrative Agriculture, 14 (2), pp. 285-294; Weber, T., Charusanti, P., Musiol-Kroll, E.M., Jiang, X., Tong, Y., Kim, H.U., Lee, S.Y., Metabolic engineering of antibiotic factories: new tools for antibiotic production in actinomycetes (2015) Trends in Biotechnology, 33 (1), pp. 15-26; Yashveer, S., Singh, V., Kaswan, V., Kaushik, A., Tokas, J., Green biotechnology, nanotechnology and bio-fortification: perspectives on novel environment-friendly crop improvement strategies (2014) Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering Reviews, 30 (1-2), pp. 113-126","Grebenyuk, A.; Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge, National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: grebenyuk@hse.ru",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029871874

Technology scanning is the technology intelligence sub-discipline for finding weak signals (early warning signals) to technology trends, and as we conjecture also for finding signals on technology-driven impeding changes in evaluation contexts in relevant markets. To do so, technology scanning uses a toolbox of methods including prediction, scenario analysis, and trend analysis methods. The main challenge of dealing with disruptive technologies is the lack of guidance on how organizations can incorporate disruptive technologies into their service op-erations to improve their service delivery. To address this challenge, we examine whether Information Systems (IS) research can contribute to this guidance by developing a conceptual model. The goal of our research is to design a method to formalize a conceptual model that supports organizations in incorporating dis-ruptive technologies into their service organization. In this paper, we present pre-liminary results related to requirements for identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies in a company's context. We also present an analysis of existing methods and design options (process, organizations, technology) for technology scanning regarding these requirements.","Control; Disruptive technology; Early warning signals; Morphology; Operations; Peo-ple; Precursor; Process; Service delivery; Service operations; Strategy; Technology; Technology; Technology scanning","Control; Decision making; Morphology; Processing; Societies and institutions; Technology; Disruptive technology; Early warning; Operations; Precursor; Service delivery; Service operations; Strategy; Technology scanning; Scanning",,,,,"Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Boston MA: Harvard Business School Press; Danneels, E., Disruptive Technology reconsidered: A critique and research agenda (2004) Jour-nal of Product Innovation Management, 21 (4), pp. 246-258; Paggettt, D., Mulvey, M.S., Differentiation via technology: Strategic positioning of services following the introduction of disruptive technology (2007) Journal of Retailing, 83 (4), pp. 375-391; Eckhard, L., (2002) Organisation der Technology Intelligence.

That's especially important if they do not possess high-quality and reliable information database on the state of internal and external environment. Thus, the purpose of this paper is the development of specialized probability diagnostic techniques for enterprise operating under the conditions of uncertainty. Two basic research methods were used in our research. Firstly, the study was conducted on the basis of review and analysis of specialized literature in the field of information diagnostic support of enterprises under the conditions of uncertainty. This allowed us to propose our own solution in this regard. Secondly, the developed diagnostic method was tested on one of the Ukrainian enterprises. The obtained results enabled us to determine the most probable threat to the functioning of the entity. We also conducted the quantitative assessment of its possible impact on the performance of the company. Therefore, suggested diagnostic techniques aim at forming the grounded information basis about different potential changes of business environment, as well as the enough time reserve, and can be recommended for the company's managers during the decision-making process under the conditions of uncertainty.","Diagnostics; Functioning environment; Information; Opportunities; Threats; Uncertainty; Weak signals",,,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., (1988) The New Corporate Strategy, , 1st Edition.

The article offers a framework of concepts relating to proactive management and sums up ideas of a number of authors on diagnostics of weak signals as possible harbingers of threats to sustainable power industry development. The authors have determined a general approach to mechanisms of threat identification and developed methodological principles of shaping a corporate management model capable of reacting to new challenges.

The research is focused on the relevant topic of mutual relations between music and leadership. Both, possibilities and advantages of music, as well as its dangers, when used for the purposes of manipulation, attract interest of scholars, philosophers and sociologists. The authors deal with the influence of music in the process of self-creation, or opposite – self-destruction. The research begins with a brief philosophical review of possible advantages and disadvantages of music and its influence on the process of education of youths and formation of the qualities of leaders. As said, this research is focused on a stream (trend) which is evaluated between leadership and music. A picture from a probable scenario and future is presented which has not sensed till now. This mentioned picture can be considered as a weak signal from a bigger universal image. The hermeneutic approach and trend analysis were the main methods of this research, and finally the authors come to the conclusion that in the world of music one may expect fundamental changes and their influence would even grow. When properly used, music will become an effective tool in the process of development of leadership skills. © Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2017.","Creative society; Dialogue; Education; Leadership; Manipulation; Music",,,,,,"Impact of Music Lyrics and Music Videos on Children and Youth (RE9648) (1996) Pediatrics, 98 (6), pp. 1219-1221; Antonakis, J., Cianciolo, A., Sternberg, R.J., (2004) The Nature of Leadership, , Los Angeles: Sage Publications; Bacchiocchi, S., The Worldview of Rock Music (1999) Endtime Issues, 33, pp. 1-19; Bajarkevičius, T., Garso meno praktikos miesto erdvėse (2014) Santalka: Filosofija, Komunikacija, 22 (1), pp. 69-76; Brzozowska, B., Creative City as a Brand-The Case of Łódź” (2016) Creativity Studies, 9 (1), pp. 3-14; Corcoran, N., Do You Mr. Jones?

This paper investigates the latter. When the environment becomes uncertain or when organizations engage in an organizational transformation, inertia or the propensity of an organization to continue its run on the same path is dangerous. Based on a survey with 108 senior managers, this paper investigates the relationships between three dynamic capabilities and Socio-Technical (ST) inertia. Results supports the general idea that the greater the capability to sense weak signals, to routinize experience of past transformations, and to reconfigure strategic resources, the lower the ST inertia. Moreover, the effect of reconfiguring is amplified with the uncertainty of the environment. Identification and understanding of particular contingencies such as firm size and industry can shed additional light on this phenomenon. © 2017 Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2017.

So, the ad hoc modes of wireless interface cards can also be used to provide device-to-device connectivity. The objective of this work is to enable toggling between the two modes (infrastructure and ad hoc) of wireless interfaces of these devices, so as to opportunistically switch between these modes depending on the availability of an access point. This provides seamless connectivity within the network, without making any changes in the existing hardware or in the protocol stack. We have developed application-level scripts to enable this mode toggling feature in WiFi equipped scenarios having less dynamism. This toggling feature can also be used to implement application-level routing between two or more ad hoc network clusters via access points, so as to provide intermittent connectivity between them. The results obtained from our experimental testbed show that our scripts work well for toggling between the two modes, and data transfer gives satisfactory performance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Ad hoc; Application-level routing; Infrastructure; Opportunistic switching; Toggling; WiFi","Ad hoc networks; Data transfer; Distributed computer systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Peer to peer networks; Standards; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Ad hoc; Application-level routing; Developed applications; Infrastructure; Intermittent connectivity; Seamless connectivity; Toggling; Wireless access points; Wireless ad hoc networks",,,,,"Nicholson, A.J., Wolchok, S., Noble, B.D., Juggler: Virtual networks for fun and profit (2010) IEEE Trans.

The outcome of GWAS is based on quality of the both phenotypic and genotypic datasets. False positive (or negative) associations can be obtained due to multiple hypothesis testing procedures, quality control measures, or an undetected population structure. The objectives of this study were to 1) investigate different multiple hypothesis testing procedures with different quality measures and 2) to detect and correct ancestral stratification using different single SNPs models of the bovine tuberculosis GWA data set. Based on a regression model, SNPs from chromosomes 2, 7, 8 and 13 were detected at a significance level of P<0.001 without correction for multiple hypothesis testing. However, after Bonferroni correction, Hochberg’s method and permutation test for multiple hypothesis correction genomic signals, it became non-significant. Only a false discovery rate approach detected weak signals (at level of 0.54) from chromosomes 2, 8, and 13. We used a model that took into account the effect of linkage disequilibrium to the multiple hypothesis testing procedures by combining adjacent SNPs test statistics with windows sizes of 2, 4 and 6. We detected strong genomic signals from chromosomes 13, 8, 6 and 2 at windows size 6. The results of this study showed that multiple hypothesis testing procedures are related to false positive genomic signals. It is difficult to suggest universally acceptable multiple hypothesis testing and QC measures and their thresholds due to sources of variations between species and within populations. However, additional analytical approaches and studies are needed to evaluate the effects of linkage disequilibrium on the multiple hypothesis testing procedures and QC measures (especially for minor allele frequencies) to GWAS under various scenarios including, but not limited to, level of heritability, linkage disequilibrium, population structure, and population size. © 2017, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

For studying the original hypotheses of social distance between the groups aged 17-22 and 65 and over, we have investigated subjective assessments of material status of the respondents from both groups, social mood in these groups, and the tolerance of young people toward the social role of older people. The main method of research was questionnaire type survey. The methodological tools developed included scaling elements, expert evaluation, and content-analysis. The task of multi-level, integrated analysis of representations was solved via a multi-stage study and data analysis using the quantitative and qualitative methods. Analysis of the problem of ""social distance"" in segments of ""17-22 years old"" and ""65+ years old"" has revealed a number of essential features, in particular, maximization of high-technology medical progress and economic benefits in the society manifesting itself in higher life expectancy, which aggravates social problems in certain social segments. Considerable material reserves are necessary for socio-economic development of older people and yet are insufficient. Medical and social services for the elderly require additional budgetary replenishment and this burden lies on the younger generation, and so on. Underestimation of the current weak signals in the modern society leads to the society's late response to them and to further increasing the ""social gap"" between these generations. © Serials Publications.","Aging of population; Older people; Social distance; Social issues; The youth",,,,,,"Atchley, R., A continuity theory of normal aging (1989) The Gerontologist, 29 (2), pp. 183-190; Bell, C.M., Brener, S.S., Gunraj, N., Huo, C., Bierman, A.S., Scales, D.C., Bajcar, J., Urbach, D.R., Association of ICU or hospital admission with unintentional discontinuation of medications for chronic diseases (2011) JAMA, 306 (8), pp. 682-690; Blanchard-Fields, F., Flexible and adaptive socio-emotional problem solving in adult development and aging (2009) Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience, 27, pp. 539-550; Bowles, J.T., The evolution of aging a new approach to an old problem of biology (1998) Medical Hypotheses, 51, pp. 179-221; Clark, A.E., Oswald, A.J., How much do external factors affect wellbeing?

In the current work, topical treatment of larvae of the lepidopteran pest, Mamestra brassicae, with conidia of Beauveria bassiana, followed by a heat stress (HS; 37 °C for 1 h) 48 h later, resulted in a similar level of larval survival to that occurring for no heat stress (No-HS), fungus-treated larvae. By contrast, when the HS was applied 24 h after fungal treatment, larval survival was significantly increased, indicating that the HS is protecting the larvae from B. bassiana. Similarly, exposure of larvae to a HS provided protection against Metarhizium brunneum (V275) at 48 h (but not 24 h) after fungal treatment. To elucidate the mechanism(s) that might contribute to HS-induced increases in larval survival against fungal infection, the effects of a HS on key cellular and humoral immune responses and on the level of selected heat shock proteins (HSP) were assessed. When larvae were kept under control (No HS) conditions, there was no significant difference in the haemocyte number per ml of haemolymph over a 24 h period. However, exposure of larvae to a HS, significantly increased the haemocyte density immediately after (t = 0 h) and 4 h after HS compared to the No HS controls, whilst it returned to control levels at t = 24 h. In addition, in vitro assays indicated that haemocytes harvested from larvae immediately after (0 h) and 4 h (but not 24 h) after a HS exhibited higher rates of phagocytosis of FITC-labelled B. bassiana conidia compared to haemocytes harvested from non-HS larvae. Interestingly, the HS did not appear to increase anti-fungal activity in larval plasma. Western blot analysis using antibodies which cross react with Drosophila melanogaster HSP, resulted in a relatively strong signal for HSP 70 and HSP 90 from extracts of 50,000 and 100,000 haemocytes, respectively, harvested from No-HS larvae. By contrast, for HSP 60, a lysate derived from 200,000 haemocytes resulted in a relatively weak signal. When larvae were exposed to a HS, the level of all three HSP increased compared to the No HS control 4 h and 16 h after the HS. However, 24 h after treatment, any heat stress-mediated increase in HSP levels was minimal and not consistently detected. Similar results were obtained when HSP 90, 70, and 60 levels were assessed in fat body harvested from heat stressed and non-heat stressed larvae. With regard to HSP 27, no signal was obtained even when a lysate from 200,000 haemocytes or three times the amount of fat body were processed, suggesting that the anti-HSP 27 antibody utilised does not cross-react with the M. brassicae HSP. The results suggest that a HS-mediated increase in haemocyte density and phagocytic activity, together with an upregulation of HSP 90 and 70, may contribute to increasing the survival of M. brassicae larvae treated with B. bassiana and M. brunneum (V275). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Beauveria bassiana; Haemocytes; Heat shock proteins; Immune responses; Mamestra brassicae; Metarhizium","biocontrol agent; biological control; cells and cell components; environmental stress; fly; fungal disease; immune response; larva; moth; protein; survival; temperature effect; Cordyceps bassiana; Drosophila melanogaster; Fungi; Hexapoda; Mamestra brassicae; Metarhizium; heat shock protein; insect protein; animal; Beauveria; DNA sequence; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunology; innate immunity; larva; longevity; metabolism; microbiology; moth; physiological stress; physiology; Animals; Beauveria; Heat-Shock Proteins; Immunity, Innate; Insect Proteins; Larva; Longevity; Moths; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Stress, Physiological",,"Heat-Shock Proteins; Insect Proteins",,,"Adamo, S., Norepinephrine and octopamine: linking stress and immune function across phyla (2008) Invertebr.

It refers to how people process social information, its encoding, storage, retrieval, and application in social situations. Facial emotion recognition - defined as the capacity of individuals to recognize basic forms of affective expression that appear in faces - is one of the most important skills for social interaction and communication. Several studies report that emotion recognition is impaired in individuals with a history of violent offences, in particular, the recognition of fear and sadness in other faces. In this way, if a person cannot correctly identify the distress they are causing to another person, they are more likely to continue with the behavior that is causing the harm. Consistent with this rationale, these results have been replicated in several adult populations as well as in adolescents. Other studies in adolescent offenders have found that the misattribute expressions of disgust as anger or perceive neutral expression as negative which may also lead to more frequent antisocial behavior and even more dangerous and threatening due to the misattribution of emotions as anger. However, the use of solely clear emotional facial expressions does not provide a full view of how emotion recognition can be affected in juvenile offenders. This, as emotion expression is not a static phenomenon and each emotion can be expressed with different intensities having a diverse impact on offenders. For example, some studies have found that young offenders have an adequate recognition of anger in high intensity expressions, but were impaired in detecting anger with lower levels of expression intensity. Despite the large body of evidence with impaired emotion recognition in offenders, the evidence in juvenile offenders is still scarce and more research is needed. Antisocial behavior in adolescence has many negative outcomes in adulthood which have a direct cost to the individual and the society. If facial emotion recognition is impaired in this particular population, intervention strategies can be implemented to improve their recognition and reducing the misattribution of other emotions that may lead to antisocial behaviors. Objective: The aims of the present study were: a) to describe facial emotion recognition in a group of juvenile offenders and compare it with a group of non-offender adolescents; b) to determine which emotions were misrecognized and for which one they were mistaken (misattribution) in both groups. We hypothesized that juvenile offenders will have a worse recognition of facial emotions and that general emotions will be more misattributed with negative emotions such as fear and anger. Method: A total of 61 male juvenile offenders from a juvenile detention center and 69 non-offender male adolescents were recruited in the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala, Mexico. The non-offender adolescents had no history of criminal offenses. The juvenile offenders had history of serious offenses (as homicide, injuries, kidnapping, robbery with violence, sexual abuse, etc.). Due to policies of the ministry of the detention center, no additional information from the center or the juvenile offenders is included. Facial emotion recognition was assessed with the Facial Expressions of Emotions - Stimuli and Tests (FEEST) which explores the six basic affective expressions: happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, surprise and anger. The absence of emotion or neutral emotion was also included. Each basic affective expression was assessed with a varying level of intensity (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%). For each emotion, an equivalent set of 11 expressions was developed, three for the expressions for each 25%, 50% and 75% intensity of the expression and 2 more for the prototype emotional expression (100%). The neutral expression was exhibited in 4 images. Results: Juvenile offenders were older than non-offender adolescents (17.0 vs 16.1 years; p < 0.001). A low emotion recognition was observed in the sample, where surprise (58.3%) and happiness (58.1%) were the emotions with higher percentage of recognition. Happiness, fear and neutral emotion recognition by intensity level were similar in both groups. Anger and disgust were also similar between groups except in the assessment of these emotions at a 50% intensity level, where juvenile offenders reported a lower recognition (anger: 34.4%; disgust: 32.7%) than non-offender adolescents (anger: 45.8%; disgust: 43.4%; p < 0.05 in both comparisons). The most important differences were found in the recognition of surprise and sadness. Juvenile offenders had a lesser recognition of surprise at an intensity level of 100% to 50% (p < 0.01) while sadness at 100% and at 25% intensity level was better recognize by juvenile offenders than non-offender adolescents (100%: 56.5% vs 43.4%, p = 0.03; 25%: 16.3% vs 8.6%, p = 0.01). Surprise, sadness and disgust were more frequently misattributed to neutral emotion in both groups, while anger was misattributed with anger and with neutral emotion. Also, neutral emotion was more frequently recognized as anger. Conclusion: Our findings provide additional support for our hypothesis that juvenile offenders showed a general deficit in recognizing facial emotions when these are presented in different intensity levels. Our results indicate that offenders are equally capable of recognizing prototype emotional expressions with the exception of sadness which has been previously reported in adolescent with high levels of psychopathic traits and disruptive behaviors. However, social environment may also play an important role in the recognition of this emotion as they may come from environments less supportive to the development and open expression of sadness. Somehow surprising, the most important recognition deficit was found with surprise. We considered that this emotion may be partially perceived as an alarm sign that may induce offenders to a relatively more intense aroused state due to a perceived threaten. Deficit recognition of low intensity expressions of anger and disgust, with adequate recognition of these emotions at high intensity (75% and 100%), support that adolescent offenders are less sensitive to weak signals of displeasure and punishment. It has been shown that offenders are more likely to misattribute disgust as anger and ambiguous emotions as surprise or neutral expressions as negative. Some previous studies reported that the perceivers' own emotional states influenced the recognition of others' emotional facial expressions. Therefore, we can hypothesize that juvenile delinquents might be projecting their own heightened angry emotions onto others when they misperceive others' negative, but not hostile, emotional states as anger, disgust and surprise, result that should be replicated in further studies. In summary, we found that compared to a sample of non-offender adolescents, juvenile offenders showed impairments in the recognition of facial emotions. The main limitations of the study are related to many confounding variables that may also be related to emotion recognition deficits such as social environment, psychiatric disorders and personality traits. We did not have access to this information in the juvenile offender sample due to policies of the ministry of the detention center. Future research including these factors may provide additional and valuable information regarding the emotion recognition in juvenile offenders. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The trends highlighted are then followed, changed, brought out, accentuated, etc. However, a recent look at mobility behaviors and how they are evolving (for example, the speed with which bicycle use has made a comeback in densely-populated cities is instructive in this regard), and at recent societal changes (particularly as regards the development of Information and Communication Technology [ICT]) suggests the need for methods that better reflect behavioral changes by being more attentive to weak signals relative to mobility. The goal of this article is to offer a prospective view for France in 2050. The analysis was funded by SNCF in preparation for the Paris Climate Conference (COP 21). Our main objective is to demonstrate and discuss an original, 4-step prospective analysis method. Phase one - the diagnostic phase - is based on a review of scientific and gray literature from the past five years and a quantitative survey of a representative sample of the population (in France). For this, we surveyed 1800 persons aged 15 and older by telephone. In phase two - the staging phase - key changes in mobility behaviors (on which the prospective scenarios were built) are highlighted. Phase three explores the various figures. Once the main lines of the scenarios have been sketched, the modal shares and associated energy consumption is determined. The objective of this prospective work is highly political, given that these figures are intended for use in planning policy that is both realistic (taking into account current infrastructure and service offerings, and their capacity for change) and readable (positioning relative current situations abroad). The fourth and final stages establish a political agenda with concrete actions for the short, medium and long term. In this article we describe the first three stages, systematically explaining our choices. We take stock of the current situation of human mobility by interpreting the latest trends described in the literature and the results of the quantitative survey. We then describe the three resulting scenarios - ultra-mobility, altermobility and proxy-mobility - explaining in detail the hypotheses upon which we built them, as well as the modal shares, traffic volumes and CO2 emissions associated with them. © 2016 The Authors.","France; mobility; prospective; scenario",,,,,,"Acket, C., Bacher, P., (2014) Diviser Par Quatre les Rejets de Co2 Dus À l'Énergie: Le Scénario Negatep; Apel, D., Pharoah, T., Transport concepts in European cities (1995) Avebury Studies in Green Research; Ascher, F., (1995) Métapolis Ou l'Avenir des Villes, , Odile Jacob Paris; Banister, D., (2005) Unsustainable Transport, , Spon Press London; Belton-Chevallier, L., Mobile ICTs as tools of intensification of travel time use?

This device can be tuned to amplify a desired, single frequency weak signal, well below resonance. The transition between a previously described theoretical model and a working prototype requires an additional effort in several areas: modeling, design, calibration, identification, verification, and adjustment of the theoretical model. The present paper describes these necessary steps and analyzes the results. Tunability is achieved here by adding a digitally controlled feedback, driving a linear mechanical oscillator with an electromechanical actuator. The main advantage of the present approach stems from the separation of the controlled parametric and nonlinear feedback terms which are linked to the resonating element. This separation allows for the realization of feedback in an electronic form where a digital implementation adds further advantages as the feedback coefficients can be tuned in situ. This arrangement benefits from the mechanical resonance of a structure and from the ability to set the parametric excitation such that it accommodates sinusoidal input signals over a wide range of frequencies. The importance of an in situ identification phase is made clear in this work, as the precise setting of model and feedback parameters was shown to be crucial for successful application of the amplifier. A detailed model-identification effort is described throughout this paper. It has been shown through identification that the approach is robust despite some modeling uncertainties and imperfections. © 2016 by ASME.",,"Electromechanical actuators; Electromechanical devices; Mechanical actuators; Nonlinear feedback; Oscillistors; Uncertainty analysis; Digital implementation; Digitally controlled; Experimental and numerical validations; Linear mechanical oscillators; Mechanical resonance; Parametric excitations; Sinusoidal input signals; Theoretical modeling; Parametric amplifiers",,,,,"Rhoads, J.F., Miller, N.J., Shaw, S.W., Feeny, B.F., Mechanical domain parametric amplification (2008) ASME J.

The objective of the study is to reveal future themes affecting the operational environment of the cadastral system by using research methods provided by futurology. The method used in this study is called environmental scanning and it consists of three phases: collecting events, recognizing phenomena and combining the phenomena as themes.The study analyses 352 literature sources and reveals 14 different future themes in the operational environment of the cadastral system, which are economic pressure, demographic changes, development of technology, transparent society, safety, environmental values, globalization, digitalization, know-how, quality, political change, soft values, public-private partnership and crowd sourcing. The future themes, their possible relations between each other and their significance for the cadastral system are analyzed by using the concepts of megatrends, trends, wild cards, driving forces and weak signals and reflecting the results to research made in the field of land management internationally.The results can be used when renewing a cadastral system, in order to consider possible future themes that may affect the system. Detecting and recognizing the future themes provides an opportunity to react and change the course of action in order to adapt to the future. The results are not only usable in the Finnish context, but can also be applied in other countries' development of their cadastre and as part of environmental scanning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cadastral system; Cadastre; Environmental scanning; Future studies","cadastre; conceptual framework; development project; environmental monitoring; future prospect; land management; Finland",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York, 239 p; Bennett, R., Rajabifard, A., Kalantari, M., Wallace, J., Williamson, I., Cadastral Futures: Building a New Vision for the Nature and Role of the Cadastres (2011) International Federation of Surveyors, Article of the Month-June, p. 14; Choo, C.W., Environmental scanning as information seeking and organizational learning (2001) Info.

Spectral contrast is key to measuring weak signals and can reach a 103 peak-to-background ratio in a single-pass assembly. At its heart, this limit is a consequence of an unbalanced field amplitude across multiple interfering paths, with an ensuing reduced fringe visibility. Using a high-resolution, high-throughput virtually imaged phased array spectrometer, we demonstrate an intensity-equalization method to achieve an unprecedented 1000-fold increase in spectral contrast in a single-stage, single-pass configuration. To validate the system, we obtain the Brillouin spectrum of water at high scattering concentrations where, unlike with the standard scheme, the inelastic peaks are highly resolved. Our method brings the interferometer close to its ultimate limits and allows rapid high-resolution spectral analysis in a wide range of fields, including Brillouin spectroscopy, mechanical imaging, and molecular fingerprinting. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,,,,,,"Vaughan, J.M., Randall, J.T., Brillouin scattering, density and elastic properties of the lens and cornea of the eye (1980) Nature (London), 284, p. 489; Antonacci, G., Pedrigi, R.M., Kondiboyina, A., Mehta, V.V., De Silva, R., Paterson, C., Krams, R., Török, P., Quantification of plaque stiffness by Brillouin microscopy in experimental thin cap fibroatheroma (2015) J.

Previous attempts of data-driven technology roadmaps have mainly focused on data from such sources as patents and literatures. However, as these sources catalogue posteriori trends of evolution, roadmaps based on these data cannot be counted on to predict disruptions. In this regard, futuristic data in technology foresight websites may provide a better source. The objective of this research, in response, is to develop a support system for technology roadmapping that uses futuristic data. To this end, we suggest keyword-based visual scanning approach involving three keyword maps, used in succession: keyword cluster map, keyword intensity map, and keyword relationship map. Particularly, keyword intensity map is designed using weak signal theory which can help identify the visibility, diffusion, and interpretation of signals. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","futuristic data; Technology roadmapping; visual analysis; weak signal","technological development; visual analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals (1975) California Management Review, (2), pp. 21-34. , citeulike-article-id:1109593; Cable, J.H., Ordonez, J.F., Chintalapani, G., Plaisant, C., (2004), “Project Portfolio Earned Value Management Using Treemaps.” Proceedings of the Project Management Institute Research Conference, London; Cachia, R., Compañó, R., Da Costa, O., Grasping the Potential of Online Social Networks for Foresight (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74 (8), pp. 1179-1203; Choi, S., Kim, H., Yoon, J., Kim, K., Lee, J.Y., An SAO-Based Text-Mining Approach for Technology Roadmapping Using Patent Information (2013) R and D Management, 43 (1), pp. 52-74; Christensen, C.M., Baumann, H., Ruggles, R., Sadtler, T.M., Disruptive Innovation for Social Change (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (12), pp. 94-101; Davies, D.L., Bouldin, D.W., A Cluster Separation Measure (1979) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine IntelligencePAMI-1, (2), pp. 224-227; Drew, S.A.W., Building Technology Foresight: Using Scenarios to Embrace Innovation (2006) European Journal of Innovation Management, 9 (3), pp. 241-257; Flexer, A., On the Use of Self-Organizing Maps for Clustering and Visualization (2001) Intelligent Data Analysis, 5 (5), pp. 373-384. , IOS Press; Geum, Y., Lee, H.J., Lee, Y., Park, Y., Development of Data-Driven Technology Roadmap Considering Dependency: An ARM-Based Technology Roadmapping (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 91, pp. 264-279. , Elsevier Inc; Hamel, G., (2002) Leading the Revolution: How to Thrive in Turbulent Times by Making Innovation a Way of Life, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Hiltunen, E., The Future Sign and Its Three Dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Jeong, Y., Yoon, B., Development of Patent Roadmap Based on Technology Roadmap by Analyzing Patterns of Patent Development (2015) Technovation, 39-40 (May), pp. 37-52; Kim, J., Park, Y., (2014), “Supporting Technology Foresight for Disruptive Innovation : Keyword-Based Visual Analysis for Futuristic Data.” Proceedings of the Asia Pacific Industrial Engineering & Management Systems Conference 2014, Jeju, South Korea; Kohonen, T., The Self-Organizing Map (1998) Neurocomputing, 21 (1-3), pp. 1-6; Kostoff, R.N., Boylan, R., Simons, G.R., Disruptive Technology Roadmaps (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 141-159; Lee, S., Lee, S., Seol, H., Park, Y., Using Patent Information for Designing New Product and Technology: Keyword Based Technology Roadmapping (2008) R&D Management, 38 (2), pp. 169-188; Martin, H., Daim, T., Technology Roadmapping through Intelligence Analysis: Case of Nanotechnology (2008) International Journal of Society Systems Science, 1 (1), pp. 49-66; Mendonça, S., Cardoso, G., Caraça, J., The Strategic Strength of Weak Signal Analysis (2012) Futures, 44 (3), pp. 218-228; Morris, S., DeYong, C., Wu, Z., Salman, S., Yemenu, D., DIVA: A Visualization System for Exploring Document Databases for Technology Forecasting (2002) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 43 (4), pp. 841-862; Paap, J., Katz, R., Anticipating Disruptive Innovation (2004) IEEE Engineering Management Review, 32 (4), pp. 74-85; Pang, A.S.K., Futures 2.0: Rethinking the Discipline (2010) Foresight, 12 (1), pp. 5-20; Park, H., Kim, K., Choi, S., Yoon, J., A Patent Intelligence System for Strategic Technology Planning (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (7), pp. 2373-23790; Phaal, R., Farrukh, C.J.P., Probert, D.R., Technology Roadmapping – A Planning Framework for Evolution and Revolution (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 5-26; Rossel, P., Weak Signals as a Flexible Framing Space for Enhanced Management and Decision-Making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21 (3), pp. 307-320; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The Big Picture – Trends, Drivers, Wild Cards, Discontinuities and Weak Signals (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 292-312; Schatzmann, J., Schäfer, R., Eichelbaum, F., Foresight 2.0 – Definition, Overview & Evaluation (2013) European Journal of Futures Research, 1 (1), pp. 1-15; Shneiderman, B., Dunne, C., Sharma, P., Wang, P., Innovation Trajectories for Information Visualizations: Comparing Treemaps, Cone Trees, and Hyperbolic Trees (2012) Information Visualization, 11 (2), pp. 87-105; Vesanto, J., Himberg, J., (1999), “Self-Organizing Map in Matlab: The SOM Toolbox.” The Matlab DSP Conference 1999, 35–40.

Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive search, big data-based mate recommendations, and varying levels of anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to check out a potential mate's profile while not leaving any visible online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates ""weak signals"" of interest for their potential mates that may play an important role in establishing successful communication. We run a randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited, in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated by a corresponding increase in quality of matches.

In recent years, with the development of seismic attribute technology, fusion technology gradually becomes a new method of attribute analysis. It can effectively improve the limitations of a single attribute analysis, the more reliable the results of reservoir description and make the results of reservoir description more reliable. What is more, attribute fusion can enhance the weak signals, what is significant for some small sand body's identification. The channel of sands is characterized by small, scattered and thin and can. be recognized effectively by the attribute fusion technology. Firstly, this paper expounds the necessity of attribute fusion; secondly, the attribute fusion technology process is established; at last, we give the recognition result of the channel sands and verified by drilling data. Real data processing confirms that the recognition result of fusion attribute is better than the single attribute.","Attribute fusion; Channel sand; Sand body recognition; Single attribute; Weak signal","data processing; drilling; sand; seismicity; technology adoption",,,,,"Li, T.T., Wang, Z., Ma, S.Z., Summary of seismic attributes fusion method[J] (2015) Progress in Geophysics), (1), pp. 378-385. , In Chinese; Zhao, H., Yin, C., Zhu, S.J., Technique of seismic multi-attribute fusion[J] (2009) PEG, 32 (2), pp. 119-121. , 79-80, In Chinese; Chen, J., Cheng, J.X., Technique of seismic multiattribute fusion based on RGB-HIS [J] (2014) Journal of Oil and Gas Technology, 11, pp. 69-73. , 6, In Chinese; Deng, F., Nian, Y.J., Wang, Z.G., Application of seismic multi - Attributes RGBA color blending [J] (2010) Geophysical Prospecting for Petroleum, (3), pp. 248-252. , 5, In Chinese; (2014) Processing and Display of Offset-dependent Reflectivity in Reflection Seisnograms[D], , Onstoff, Austin, USA: University of Texas; Li, X.X., (2014) Research on the Application of Seismic Multi - Attributes Fusion Methods[D], , Chengdu: Chengdu University of Technology, In Chinese; Duan, C.J., Zhao, H., Wu, H.N., Research on technique of seismic attributes synthesis based on wells [J] (2009) Progress in Geophysics, (1), pp. 288-292. , In Chinese; Li, F., Wang, S.D., Chen, X.H., Automatic matching of seismic and logging data [J] (2014) OGP, 49 (1), pp. 197-204. , 307, In Chinese; Ma, G.K., Li, D., Sui, B., The application of seismic multi-attributtes based on the integration reconstruction technique to reservoir prediction[J] (2013) Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration, 37 (6), pp. 993-997. , In Chinese; Wu, Z.R., Duan, W.Y., Shi, L., The Technology for identifying the river sand body in penglaizhen formation of western sichuan depression[J] (2003) Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration, 27 (4), pp. 299-301. , 304, In Chinese; Shi, L.T., Yang, Q.L., Yi, D.H., Sedimentary Evolution and reservoir - Cap rock assemblages of palaeogeue in dawangzhang area, raoyang sag, central hebei province [J] (2007) Journal of East China Institute of Technology, (2), pp. 132-136. , In Chinese; Zhao, L.M., Peng, S.P., Lang, X.L., Application of stratimagic waveform classification technique to the research of lithologic oil reservoir in Dawangzhuang area [J] (2002) Acta Petrolei Sinica, (4), pp. 33-36. , 5, In Chinese; Xie, X.L., Sun, S., Wang, Y.C., The application of seismic instantaneous attributes based on EEMD in glutenite[J] (2014) Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration, 38 (4), pp. 717-722. , In Chinese; Liu, A.Q., The recognition of chengdao oilfield fauit system[J] (2009) Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration, 33 (1), pp. 54-57. , In Chinese; Yao, W., Wu, C.L., Shi, Y.P., Sedimentary characteristics research on lower Cretaceous in Honghaoershute Depression using seismic multi - Attribute fusion [J] (2013) OGP, 48 (4), pp. 634-642. , 676, 505, In Chinese",,,,"China National Publications Import and Export (Group) Corporation",,,,,10011749,,,,"Chinese","Wutan Huatan Jisuan Jishu",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015852966

Although research has examined frameworks and concepts that lead to high-quality performance, few studies examine how to sustain high-quality performance. Sustaining performance may require additional capabilities from what it takes to achieve it. Drawing on quality management literature, organizational resilience literature, and the theory of dynamic capabilities in the strategy literature, this study empirically investigates the effects of four capabilities that help sustain high-quality performance. The analysis shows that capabilities in improvement, innovation, sensing weak signals, and responsiveness all help sustain high-quality performance. This suggests that what it takes to achieve high-quality performance is different, in part, from what it takes to sustain it. The data comes from a survey of 147 manufacturing business units. The analysis shows that the relative benefits of these capabilities may depend on the level of competitive intensity and environmental uncertainty. The findings provide empirical support for a theoretical model and practical guidance for sustaining quality performance. © 2016 Decision Sciences Institute","Dynamic capability; High reliability; Quality management; Resilience; Sustaining performance",,,,,,"Ahire, S.L., An empirical investigation of quality management in small firms (1996) Production & Inventory Management Journal, 37 (2), pp. 44-50; Ahire, S.L., O'Shaughnessy, K.C., The role of top management commitment in quality management: An empirical analysis of the auto parts industry (1998) International Journal of Quality Science, 3 (1), pp. 5-37; Aiken, L., West, S., (1991), #x0026;, Multiple regression Testing and interpreting interactions, Newbury Park, CA, Sage; Bagozzi, R.P., (1994), Advanced methods of marketing research, Cambridge, MA, Blackwell Business; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Benson, P.G., Saraph, J.V., Schroeder, R.G., The effects of organizational context on quality management: An empirical investigation (1991) Management Science, 37 (9), pp. 1107-1124; Berry, L.L., Parasuraman, A., Listening to the customer-the concept of a service-quality information system (1997) Sloan Management Review, 38, pp. 65-76; Bode, C., Wagner, S.M., Petersen, K.J., Ellram, L.M., Understanding responses to supply chain disruptions: Insights from Information processing and resource dependence perspectives (2011) Academy of Management Journal, 54 (4), pp. 833-856; Bodek, N., Green, J., (2011), #x0026;,).

The fact that it receives a remarkably weak signal from space, new development such as increase in parabolic dish size and operating frequency has been made. However, these development has caused position control more stringent. This paper employ PID controller and introduces fuzzy logic controller for this purpose. Different type of membership function is tested in order to choose the best output result. Then the performance of the best type is compared with PID controller. Both controllers are designed in Simulink MATLAB environment. The proposed fuzzy controller able to attenuate overshoot while PID has 44% and 6.65% overshoot in both speed and position loop. Hence, fuzzy logic controller has greater performance than PID controller. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

However, in the process of packaging, warpage and residual stress have always been major problems, such as pin deviation, breakage, and weak signals. Further, the distinctive properties of the numerous materials that comprise a semiconductor chip demand different molding temperatures; thus, excessive internal thermal stresses are produced within the packaging structure which ultimately results in colloid warpage. This study used a 3D coordinate measuring machine to determine the levels of warpage produced in electronic packaging products and to verify the amount of warpage simulated by the finite element method. Then, Taguchi method was also utilized to analyze and discuss the four critical control factors namely: (1) shape of the heat sink; (2) thickness of molding; (3) molding temperature; and (4) thickness of soldering tin. Thus, the minimum thermal stress for electronic packaging components was obtained, which meant the optimal parameter combination for the packaging was a triangle-shaped heat sink, with a molding compound of 1.175 mm thick, a molding temperature of 170 °C, and a soldering tin that was 0.03 mm thick. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electronic component packaging; Finite element method; Taguchi method; Thermal stress","Chip scale packages; Electronics packaging; Heat sinks; Molding; Network components; Packaging; Soldering; Taguchi methods; Thermal stress; Tin; Electronic component; Electronic Packaging; Electronic-packaging components; Heat dissipation mechanism; Optimal parameter combinations; Packaging structure; Packaging technologies; Semiconductor chips; Finite element method",,,,,"Wu, S., Lu, H., Yang, T., Yeh, C.P., Process Induced Warpage and Residual Stress in Populated Ball Grid Array Substrate Panel, Advanced Packaging Materials (1998) Proceedings, 4th International Symposium, Braselton, pp. 151-152; Kuwata, K., Iko, K., Tabata, H., Low-stress resin encapsulants for semiconductor devices (1986) IEEE Trans. on Components Hybrids and Manuf.

At low latitudes, the pattern of oscillations is not well established. To address this issue, pollen analysis was performed at Ciénega San Marcial, a monsoon-influenced site located on the southeastern edge of the Sonoran Desert at the limit of the tropical thornscrub. The pollen record covers the Late Wisconsinan glacial termination II, from 15 650 to 13 400 cal. a BP, including GS-2 and the Lateglacial interstadial, and a recent historical period (AD c. 1919 to 2004). We applied the modern analogue technique, in which pollen taxa are assigned to plant functional types (PFTs), to reconstruct the past climates. At the end of GS-2, a Juniperus–Pinus woodland is indicative of annual temperatures 10±2 °C colder than present and higher annual precipitation dominated by winter rains. The onset of the Lateglacial interstadial occurs at c. 15 500 cal. a BP, resulting in a lower sedimentation rate and the spread of a xeric grassland. This period is associated with an increase in summer insolation. A weak signal of summer monsoon intensification is dated to 14 825 cal. a BP but is associated with colder winter temperatures. A wider spread of tropical taxa occurs after 13 800 cal. a BP, along with the loss of Juniperus, suggesting a temperature increase of approximately 3 °C. In spite of the earlier Lateglacial warming, the transition from glacial to interstadial conditions seems to be related to North Atlantic atmospheric variations. We conclude that during the last glacial–interglacial transition, the Sonoran Desert at 28.5° latitude was sensitive to climate variations originating in northern latitudes. The recent historical sequence displays summer-dominant precipitation and additional drivers of climate change, including anthropogenic factors and El Niño, thus showing a stronger Pacific circulation influence in the subrecent period. © 2016 Collegium Boreas.

REE have been shown to accumulate in high concentrations in roots of plants. Plant experiments with Zea mays exposed to a nutrient solution containing gadolinium (Gd) or yttrium (Y) with 10 mg L-1 Gd or Y were carried out to investigate this accumulation behaviour. Total concentrations of 3.17 g kg-1 and 8.43 g kg-1 of Gd and Y were measured in treated plant roots. Using a novel combination of laser ablation mass spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, imaging of location and concentration of Gd and Y was carried out in root thin sections of treated roots. Single spots of elevated REE concentration were found at the epidermis, while inside the cortex, weak signals of Gd+ and Y+ were aligning with the root cell structures. The composition of Gd-containing secondary ions proves an REE-oxide phase accumulated at the epidermis, limiting REE availability for further uptake. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Gadolinium; Laser ablation; Mass spectrometry; Secondary emission; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Spectrometry; Yttrium; Combination of lasers; Increasing production; Nutrient solution; Oxide phase; Secondary ions; Thin section; Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry; Weak signals; Yttrium alloys; gadolinium; lanthanide; yttrium; gadolinium; lanthanide; yttrium; bioaccumulation; gadolinium; maize; mass spectrometry; root; speciation (chemistry); yttrium; Article; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dry mass; fluorescence microscopy; follow up; laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; maize; mass spectrometry; molecular model; nonhuman; plant epidermis; plant root; sensitivity analysis; time of flight mass spectrometry; time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry; chemistry; mass spectrometry; metabolism; procedures; spectroscopy; Zea mays; Gadolinium; Mass Spectrometry; Metals, Rare Earth; Plant Roots; Spectrum Analysis; Yttrium; Zea mays",,"gadolinium, 7440-54-2; yttrium, 7440-65-5; Gadolinium; Metals, Rare Earth; Yttrium",,,"Babula, P., Adam, V., Opatrilova, R., Zehnalek, J., Havel, L., Kizek, R., Uncommon heavy metals, metalloids and their plant toxicity: A review (2008) Environ.

In this case, the localization of the target is difficult due to side-lobes of the interferers. By incorporating the prior knowledge of the uncertain parameters, we have proposed a robust localization method [Liu, et al. Robust source localization using predictable mode subspace in uncertain shallow ocean environment. OCEANS'13], in which the replica vector is reconstructed using the predictable mode subspace. In this paper, the method is further extended to work in the loud interference presence environment with the help of the orthogonal projection matrix. The general mismatch benchmark model was used to verify the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method has a better localization performance than the mean model matched field processor (MFP) when there is a loud interference in uncertain environment. © 2016 IEEE.","Interference Suppression; mode subspace; orthogonal projection matrix; reconstructed replica vector; robust localization; uncertain ocean environment","Interference suppression; Oceanography; Uncertainty analysis; Underwater acoustics; Localization method; Localization performance; mode subspace; Ocean environment; Orthogonal projection matrices; robust localization; Uncertain environments; Uncertain parameters; Vectors",,,,,"Baggeroer, A.B., Kuperman, W.A., Mikhalevsky, P.N., An overview of matched-filed methods in ocean acoustics (1993) IEEE J.

In order to understand the atomic/electronic structure in oxide interfaces, various characterization techniques have been involved. In the past, the characterization has been limited to broad beam techniques though X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to achieve the average physical and chemical information. With techniques such as scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), high-resolution TEM opens the path to the study of chemical composition and bonding information coupled with the atomic level images, and thus provides an ideal tool to investigate individual interface. Interface can't be physically isolated from the bulk, it is difficult to correctly and effectively extract the weak signal from these interfaces presented in a solid bulk. Such extraction remains a very challenging issue even in TEM when thin foils, with thickness less than 100 nm, are used. The visibility of these interfaces can be enhanced by picking up corresponding signals since the elastically scattered electrons contributing to signals from these interfaces are distributed unevenly in space and differently compared to the ones contributed by the bulk. Studying cross-sectional samples provides two-dimensional projected information of the three-dimensional interfacial structures. Accordingly, the atomic structure can be constructed through combining information from different projections. Regarding the fact that EELS signals from the defects and the bulk are distributed similarly in space, a new experimental approach, based on a “thickness” series of EEL spectra containing different bulk contributions, was proposed to effectively extract weak EELS signals from these interfaces. The development of characterization techniques such as TEM has led to improved understanding of oxide interfaces and thus provides great opportunity to create artificial structure for their novel physical properties. © 2016, The Editorial Board of Materials China.

The dynamics of photoinitiated carriers and their interactions with intrinsic and surface defects are still not fully understood, yet clearly are responsible for pyrite's underwhelming photovoltaic and photocatalytic performance. Here we report, to our knowledge for the first time, broadband ultrafast transient reflection from single-crystal natural iron pyrite with several excitation wavelengths both higher and lower than the accepted nominal bandgap of pyrite. We also demonstrate a method to transform transient reflection to transient absorption, without requiring any assumptions regarding the magnitude of either the absorption coefficient or the refractive index, allowing for a more direct interpretation of our results. An important finding from this work is the observation of a long-lived weak signal when pumping with 0.58 eV, an energy well below the accepted bandgap, which may be evidence for direct optical excitation of either intrinsic trailing edges of the bands or midgap defect states. We identify that after approximately 10 ps the transient spectra due to pumping at 2.59, 1.58, and 0.91 eV all appear qualitatively similar, suggesting relaxation to a common carrier distribution. This common distribution appears to decay on two time scales of about 30 and ≫200 ps. Our results should play a role in understanding charge carrier dynamics within the intricate and complex band structure of pyrite and hopefully provide clarification and direction for future efforts in the development of iron pyrite based technologies. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Dynamics; Energy gap; Iron; Iron compounds; Refractive index; Single crystals; Surface defects; Absorption co-efficient; Charge carrier dynamics; Complex band structures; Excitation wavelength; Photocatalytic performance; Physical and chemical properties; Reflection spectroscopy; Transient absorption; Pyrites",,,,,"Murphy, R., Strongin, D.R., Surface Reactivity of Pyrite and Related Sulfides (2009) Surf.

Yet, the exact implications of complexity science for FS remain somewhat opaque. This paper explicitly sets out the challenges for FS that arise from six complexity science concepts: (1) irreversibility of time (2) path dependence 3) sensitivity to initial conditions (4) emergence and systemness (5) attractor states (6) complex causation. The discussion highlights the implications of these challenges for FS tools such as horizon scanning and weak signals, and sets out the benefits of overcoming the challenges to create an explicitly complexity-orientated FS. The discussion concludes with a set of questions summarising the challenge for FS from complexity science with the aim of stimulating a discussion as to how they can be met. The concluding remarks make some initial suggestions in this regard. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Complexity science; Emergence; Futures Studies; Horizon scanning; Scenario planning; Uncertainty; Weak signals","complexity; future prospect; planning process; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Multi-ontology, sense-making and the emergence of the future (2009) Futures, 41, pp. 279-283; Aiginger, K., The great recession vs. the great depression: stylized facts on siblings that were given different foster parents (2010) Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment e-Journal, 4; Aldred, J., Climate change uncertainty, irreversibility and the precautionary principle (2012) Cambridge Journal of Economics, 36, pp. 1051-1072; Almunia, M., Benetrix, A., Eichengreen, B., O'Rourke, K.H., Rua, G., From great depression to great credit crisis: similarities, differences and lessons (2010) Economic Policy, 25, pp. 219-265; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 28, pp. 28-33; Arthur, W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by small historical events (1989) Economic Journal, 99, pp. 116-131; Arthur, W.B., (2009) The nature of technology: what it is and how it evolves, , Penguin, London; Axtell, R., The complexity of exchange (2005) The Economic Journal, 115, pp. F193-F210; Ayres, R.U., Axtell, R., Foresight as a survival characteristic: when (if ever) does the long view pay?

We analysed the mitochondrial diversity of the Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) across the Iberian Peninsula, where the species is currently expanding north-west. A total of 242 individuals were analysed, together with nine representatives from the North African dispersal source. Haplotype segregation and strong differentiation between Iberian and North African populations confirmed the long-term presence of the species in the Iberian Peninsula. The distribution of mitochondrial diversity fitted the pattern of a historically diversified population in southern Iberia, from which the recent dispersals into northern areas may have occurred. Higher levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversities in the northern areas, together with the heterogeneous distribution of pairwise population differentiations and the weak signal for isolation-by-distance suggest the existence of long-dispersal migrants across the Iberian Peninsula. Sudden and spatial expansion scenarios of H. ichneumon in the Iberian Peninsula were supported by mismatch analysis and marginally supported by neutrality tests. However, the precise time of occurrence of the detected expansion remains unclear. Future studies should incorporate additional markers in order to further clarify the population dynamics of the Egyptian mongoose in its Iberian range. © 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.","Demographic history; Genetic diversity; Herpestes ichneumon; Iberian peninsula; Mitochondrial DNA","carnivore; demographic history; dispersal; genetic differentiation; heterogeneity; mammal; mitochondrial DNA; population dynamics; population structure; range expansion; species occurrence; Iberian Peninsula; North Africa; Herpestes ichneumon",,,,,"Alda, F., Ruiz-López, M.J., García, F.J., Gompper, M.E., Eggert, L.S., García, J.T., Genetic evidence for multiple introduction events of raccoons (Procyon lotor) in Spain (2013) Biol.

Researchers generally identify collective action by small changes in communication frequency, emerging key words, and sentiment. However, most studies only consider the present environment, which may not evolve into a collective action, or conduct a short-term prediction in which significant damage is already done when the collective action is identified. This paper proposes a predictive framework to identify potential collective actions, considering the future evolution as well as the present situation, and providing a reference for early decision making. In the framework, a future sign to describe events is improved and the enhanced gray system theory is used to predict the evolution of a future sign. Mentions of events surrounding the Arab Spring-using over 300000 different open-content Web sources crawled from social media in seven different languages-are analyzed, which suggests that the predictive framework can more precisely identify the weak signals of collective actions. © 2017 IEEE.","Collective action; Future sign; Gray system theory; Weak signal","Decision making; System theory; Collective action; Communication frequency; Future sign; Government management; Gray system theory; Present situation; Short term prediction; Weak signals; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Kallus, N., Predicting crowd behavior with big public data (2014) Proc. 23rd Int.

The paper presents selected issues concerning the project knowledge management, early warning systems, the concept of weak signals, as well as risk analysis. There is a need for their synthesis in order to efficiently recognize the potential opportunities and threats in the project life cycle. The proposed model of an early warning system based on knowledge integrates the elements of the theory and solutions unprecedented in project management. The basic idea is that the system should provide information concerning situations that threaten the implementation of projects, about dangerous phenomena and processes as well as the probability of their development. The system should allow rapid and flexible response to the forthcoming events, which in turn should translate into faster adaptation to adverse situations arising during the implementation of the project. It is proposed to assign prediction of threats with the identification of project risks in the form of a rule-based expert system. The capture of potential opportunities constitutes at this stage of the study only an added value and does not prejudge the functionality of the proposed system.

In this paper, we target at inferring this particular user attribute called credit, i.e., whether a user is of the good credit class or not, from online social data. However, existing credit scoring methods, mainly relying on financial data, face severe challenges when tackling the heterogeneous social data. Moreover, social data only contains extremely weak signals about users’ credit label. To that end, we put forward a Latent User Behavior Dimension based Credit Model (LUBD-CM) to capture these small signals for personal credit profiling. LUBD-CM learns users’ hidden behavior habits and topic distributions simultaneously, and represents each user at a much finer granularity. Specifically, we take a real-world Sina Weibo dataset as the testbed for personal credit profiling evaluation. Experiments conducted on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: (1) User credit label can be predicted using LUBD-CM with a considerable performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines; (2) The latent behavior dimensions have very good interpretability in personal credit profiling. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Data mining; Risk assessment; Risk management; Social networking (online); Consumer credits; Credit risk management; Financial industry; Interpretability; Latent behaviors; Research problems; State of the art; Topic distributions; Behavioral research",,,,,"Arminger, G., Enache, D., Bonne, T., Analyzing credit risk data: A comparison of logistic discrimination, classification tree analysis, and feedforward networks (1997) Comput.

The dominant features of neo-collectivist consciousness are determined by integration of the value systems of collectivist and individualist cultures, as revealed by the scenarios derived from Causal Layered Analysis. The emerging neo-collectivistic culture espouses progressive elements of traditional collectivistic cultures and integrates them with those features of individualistic societies that foster sustainability. Further, Cultural Creatives and sustainable communities are identified as weak signals of the emerging neo-collectivist consciousness.","Causal layered analysis; Cultural creatives; Individualitic culture; Neo-collectivist consciousness; Social change; Sustainable communities",,,,,,"Afolabim, M.B., Adi, I.N., Bodunde, D., Contemporary issue: Is religious terrorism the greatest security threat of our time (2016) IOSR Journal of Humanities and Social Science, 21 (6), pp. 81-85; Alexandrova, A., Nancy, J.L., (2012) Re-treating religion: Deconstructing christianity with JeanLuc Nancy, , NY: Fordham University Press; Anderson, C.M., China's green cities (2011) The World Bank, , http://go.worldbank.org/NXEK3FGIR0, (January 26) Retrieved March 12; Antoniadis, P., Le Grand, B., Incentives for resource sharing in self-organized communities: From economics to social psychology (2007) 2007 2nd International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM), 2, pp. 756-761. , Lyon, France: IEEE; Assagioli, R., (1973) The act of will, , NY: Penguin Books; Bachika, R., (2002) Traditional religion and culture in a new era, , NJ: Transaction Publishers; Bakas, A., (2009) Beyond the crisis: The future of capitalism, , Tampa, FL: Meghan-Kiffer Press; Bartlett, S., (2009) The mythology bible, , London, UK: Godsfield Press; Beck-Gernsheim, E., On the way to a post-familial family: From a community of need to elective affinities (1998) Theory Culture Society, 15 (53), pp. 53-70; Beck, D.E., Cowan, C.C., (2006) Spiral dynamics: Mastering values, leadership, and change, , Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing; Behun, A.W., The apocalypticism of Joachim of Fiore and the western mystery tradition (2012) Journal of the Western Mystery Tradition, 3 (23). , http://www.jwmt.org/v3n23/behun.html, Retrieved November 9; Ulsteen, H., Bonne, A.G., (2010) Aung San Suu Kyi: Lady of no fear, , [Television broadcast].

Technology trends such as additive manufacturing (""3D printing"") and the Internet of Things with its applications such as Industrie 4.0 in production technology are seen by companies as both major opportunities and threats to their business models on an abstract level, yet the identification and especially evaluation of specific technologies impacting a company's business in the future is still difficult. Disruptive technologies threaten market incumbents as these technologies enable addressing new or latent customer requirements or evaluation dimensions in a given market rather than improving on the fulfillment of existing evaluation criteria. When the value customers place on requirements and evaluation criteria (i.e. The evaluation context) changes, this can lead to rapid devaluation of products or services using traditional technologies. Technology Scanning is the technology intelligence sub-discipline responsible for finding weak signals of technological trends, and as we conjecture also for finding signals on technology-driven impeding changes in evaluation contexts in relevant markets. To do so, Technology Scanning uses a toolbox of methods including forecasting, scenario analysis, and trend analysis methods. We have previously stated the need for practitioners to have a framework of design recommendations for technology scanning based on the specific company's strategic goals on the identification of disruptive technologies, and outlined a research agenda on providing such a framework. As part of this research agenda, in this paper we present an overview of requirements for identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies in a company's context, and give an analysis of existing methods and design options (processes, organizations etc.) for technology scanning regarding these requirements. We proceed to outline a method to systematically detect possible changes in evaluation contexts to assist identifying and evaluating disruptive technologies using cross-industry analogies. We find that concepts from technology intelligence need to be complemented with concepts from market intelligence and environmental scanning to properly evaluate upcoming disruptive changes.","Disruptive Technologies; Technology Intelligence; Technology Scanning","3D printers; Commerce; Industrial management; Scanning; Three dimensional computer graphics; Customer requirements; Design recommendations; Disruptive technology; Environmental scanning; Production technology; Technological trends; Technology intelligence; Technology scanning; Environmental technology",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E.J., (1990) Implanting Strategic Management, , 2nd ed.

I examined the relationship between ornament expression, age, and survival in the striped plateau lizard, Sceloporus virgatus, a species with female-specific ornamentation that honestly signals reproductive quality. I followed a group of females from 2008 to 2013, examined ornament color and size as females aged, and compared ornamentation of survivors versus non-survivors. In addition, I explored whether other (non-ornamental) phenotypic characters predicted survival. I found that peak ornament expression (both color and size) of individual females changed year to year but appeared to be a weak signal of age due to high among-female variation in ornament expression that occurred independent of age and a non-linear pattern of change for ornament color. However, both absolute and relative ornament size did increase significantly as an individual aged and therefore may provide some age-related information such as reproductive investment, which is expected to increase as residual reproductive value declines with age.

We developed a highly biomimetic multilayered palate substitute with bone and oral mucosa tissues using rabbit cells and biomaterials subjected to nanotechnologi-cal techniques based on plastic compression. This novel palate substitute was autologously grafted in vivo, and histological and histochemical analyses were used to evaluate biointegration, cell function, and cell differentiation in the multilayered palate substitute. The three-dimensional structure of the multilayered palate substitute was histologi-cally similar to control tissues, but the ex vivo level of cell and tissue differentiation were low as determined by the absence of epithelial differentiation although cytokeratins 4 and 13 were expressed. In vivo grafting was associated with greater cell differentiation, epithelial stratification, and maturation, but the expression of cytokeratins 4, 13, 5, and 19 at did not reach control tissue levels. Histochemical analysis of the oral mucosa stroma and bone detected weak signals for proteoglycans, elastic and collagen fibers, mineralization deposits and osteocalcin in the multilayered palate substitute cultured ex vivo. However, in vivo grafting was able to induce cell and tissue differentiation, although the expression levels of these components were always significantly lower than those found in controls, except for collagen in the bone layer. These results suggest that generation of a full-thickness multilayered palate substitute is achievable and that tissues become partially differentiated upon in vivo grafting. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Bone; Cleft palate; Nanostructuration; Oral mucosa; Tissue engineering","biomaterial; cytokeratin 13; cytokeratin 19; cytokeratin 4; cytokeratin 5; osteocalcin; proteoglycan; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bone; cell differentiation; cell maturation; collagen fiber; ex vivo study; histochemistry; in vivo study; mouth mucosa; New Zealand rabbit; nonhuman; palate; priority journal; stroma; tissue differentiation; tissue engineering",,"osteocalcin, 136461-80-8",,,"Alaminos, M., Garzon, I., Sanchez-Quevedo, M.C., Moreu, G., Gonzalez-Andrades, M., Fernandez-Montoya, A., Campos, A., Time-course study of histological and genetic patterns of differentiation in human engineered oral mucosa (2007) J Tissue Eng Regen Med, 1 (5), pp. 350-359; Alfonso-Rodriguez, C.A., Gonzalez-Andrades, E., Jaimes-Parra, B.D., Fernandez-Valades, R., Campos, A., Sanchez-Quevedo, M.C., Alaminos, M., Garzon, I., Ex vivo and in vivo modulatory effects of umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly stem cells on human oral mucosa stroma substitutes (2015) Histol Histopathol, 30 (11), pp. 1321-1332; Brouwer, K.M., Lundvig, D.M., Middelkoop, E., Wagener, F.A., von den Hoff, J.W., Mechanical cues in orofacial tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (2015) Wound Repair Regen, 23 (3), pp. 302-311; Carriel, V., Garzon, I., Campos, A., Cornelissen, M., Alaminos, M., Differential expression of GAP-43 and neurofilament during peripheral nerve regeneration through bio-artificial conduits (2014) J Tissue Eng Regen Med; Carriel, V., Scionti, G., Campos, F., Roda, O., Castro, B., Cornelissen, M., Garzon, I., Alaminos, M., In vitro characterization of a nano-structured fibrin agarose bio-artificial nerve substitute (2015) J Tissue Eng Regen Med; Cheema, U., Brown, R.A., Rapid fabrication of living tissue models by collagen plastic compression: Understanding three-dimensional cell matrix repair (2013) Adv Wound Care (New Rochelle), 2 (4), pp. 176-184; Cho-Lee, G.Y., Garcia-Diez, E.M., Nunes, R.A., Marti-Pages, C., Sieira-Gil, R., Rivera-Baro, A., Review of secondary alveolar cleft repair (2013) Ann Maxillofac Surg, 3 (1), pp. 46-50; Colbert, S.D., Green, B., Brennan, P.A., Mercer, N., Contemporary management of cleft lip and palate in the United Kingdom.

The company has carefully pursued this goal pressing through diverse cultures and barriers and has become a pace-setter in the industry. The Wells Organisation in Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) has also been ardent in its pursuit of sustaining Goal Zero thereby achieving a deserving safety record of four years Lost Time Injury (LTI) Free operations. Activities in the oil and gas industry especially rig operations are fraught with inherent risks and hazards, and sustaining the Shell Mantra of ""Goal Zero"" depends largely on hazard identification, assessment, controls and recovery. The Hazard and Effect Management Process begins with proactively anticipating these risks as well as having a ""trained eye"" to spot them, thereafter assessing them and setting the right controls in place to prevent the occurrence of an incident. Controls could be the right and competent people for the job or systems (rules) and/or fit for purpose and adequately deployed equipment. However, the importance of leadership and management controls cannot be over-emphasized in keeping Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) incidents at bay. In 2011, SPDC Wells Organisation ramped up activities increasing its number of rigs by about 167% with a number of new entrants and over 80% of inexperienced workforce requiring a lot of hand holding, but were welcomed on board due to compliance to local content development regulations. This meant an increase in man-hours to over 20,000 daily of diverse culture and nationalities resulting in an increase in HSSE exposure with the inherent safety weak signals and safety dark corners. There was a spike in HSSE incidents and violations culminating in a Lost Time Incident (LTI) on one of the rigs costing ca. $20,000 which is about the daily rate for the land rig. This spike in actual and high potential safety-related incidents raised a higher degree of chronic unease situation within the organisation. The outcome was a deep-dive into the root causes using risk based approach with clear directives to establish HSSE leadership and management controls leading to developing tangible HSE improvement strategies. This paper is a detailed X-ray on the journey with learnings that have helped in delivering Goal Zero Top Quartile performance in the SPDC Well Operations. This can be of immense help to other Oil & Gas industries that desire to stay focused in their respective Safety aspirations. We achieved four (4) years with 14,188,690 million exposure man-hours of lost time injury (LTI) free operations in 2015, consistent focus on Wells Process Safety, and 1S014001 re-certification; on an onward journey towards five (5) years LTI free milestone. The role of leadership and management controls in achieving this safety milestone within the Goal Zero framework and the impact on operational efficiency is outlined. © 2017 Society Of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Efficiency; Gas hazards; Gas industry; Hazards; Health; Industrial management; Oil field development; Petroleum engineering; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Social aspects; Hazard identification; Improvement strategies; Management control; Management process; Oil and Gas Industry; Operational efficiencies; Petroleum development; Risk based approaches; Accident prevention",,,,,"Life Saving Rules & Safety Training Observation Programme Available only On Shell Intranet, , Goal Zero accessed 13 January, 2016; Iyamu, I., (2015) The Wells 4-year LTI-free Story, , https://sww-knowledge-epg.shell.com/knowtepgl/livelink.exe/fetch/-3764023/10853068/Q4SWN2015.p, Shell World Nigeria December 2015.

This research advances knowledge on the practice of foresight in long-term planning through a comparative analysis of planning approaches in two organisations linked through common ownership. Data generated from planning documentation and the foresight practice of strategy personnel in the two cases (transport and banking) provided support for a dynamic model of foresight integrated LT planning. The ongoing collection and synthesis of strong and weak signals, and their continual assimilation into scenarios depicting alternative futures was structurally supported by a community-of-practice. The community-of-practice widely engaged strategists located across organisational levels in conversations about emerging futures and about strategies through which to engage those futures. The findings encourage managers and researchers to view long-term planning as an ongoing interrogation of implemented and envisioned strategies within emerging, alternative futures. Such an approach stimulates strategic entrepreneurship and prepares the organisation for engaging in future environments. © 2013.","Community-of-practice; Foresight; Long-term planning","Technological forecasting; Community of practice; Comparative analysis; Foresight; Long term planning; Organisational level; Research advances; Strategic capability; Weak signals; Innovation",,,,,"Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, 1. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; Ofek, E., Wathieu, L., Are you ignoring trends that could shape up your business?

To do so, we use the concepts of meta-organizations and partial organizations that were developed by Ahrne and Brunsson (2008, 2010). We conduct a case study of the oil and gas sector and show that while literature has expected these devices to retreat due to globalization and weakening of states and collective negotiations, they actually remain a powerful mean of collective action between firms. Notably, firms widely use these devices to deal with CSR and sustainable development issues, in relation with all the different stakeholders. From a strategic standpoint, these collective action devices allow firms to manage reputational effects and weak signals coming from the environment, as well as to neutralize conflicts with stakeholders. From the institutional standpoint, the invention of new organizational forms since the 1960s - business thematic and multi-stakeholder meta-organizations - occurred in a dynamics of institutional complementarity Indeed, these devices rely on one another and complete each other, therefore allowing firms to develop a broad range of collective strategies. © Presses Universitaires de France.","Collective action; Collective strategies; Devices; Meta-organization; Partial organization",,,,,,"Ahrne, G., Brunsson, N., (2008) Meta-organizations, , Cheltenham, Edward Elgar Publishing; Ahrne, G., Brunsson, N., L'organisation en dehors des organisations, ou l'organisation incomplète (2010) Le Libellio d'AEGIS, 6 (1), pp. 36-52; Andolfatto, D., Labbé, D., (2012) Sociologie des Syndicats, , Paris, La Découverte; Aoki, M., (2001) Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis, , Cambridge MA, MIT Press; Astley, G.W., Fombrun, C., Collective strategy: Social ecology of organizational environments (1983) Academy of Management Review, 8 (4), pp. 576-587; Barley, S., Signifying institutions (2010) Management Communication Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 200-206; Baron, D., Integrated strategy: Market and nonmarket components (1995) California Management Review, 37 (2), pp. 47-65; Baron, D., (2010) Business and its Environment, , Upper Saddle River, Prentice-Hall, 6th ed; Bastianutti, J., Dumez, H., Pourquoi les entreprises sont-elles désormais reconnues comme socialement responsables ?

On the one hand it considers the external approach, that is, the analysis of visible signals linked to the emerging issues that in an early stage are called ""weak signals"". On the other hand, it tries to study emerging issues taking into account their internal motivations. In this case the aim is to value the social, economic or other kind of reasons that are hidden under emerging issues. A post-structuralism perspective (CLA, causal layered analysis) is used to address this objective.This double approach allows to consider emerging issues in a holistic way, taking into account what is visible and what is not so apparent. In order to offer conclusions and results a real use case is included analyzing the emerging issues showed in the report ""Informe de la Sociedad de la Información 2013"" (one of the references about information society situation and ICT trends in Spain). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CLA; Emerging issues; Igor Ansoff; SIE2013; Weak signals","assessment method; information and communication technology; Spain",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., (1975), 18 (2). , Managing Strategic Surprise by Response to Weak Signals California Management Review; Ansoff, I.H., Using weak signals (1984) Implanting strategic management, p. 20. , Pretince/Hall International Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Ashley, D.B., Project Risk Identification Using Inference Subjective Expert Assessment and Historical Data, The State of the Art in Project Risk Management (1989) International Project Management Association, Proceeding 1989, pp. 9-25; Battistella, C., The organisation of corporate foresight: a multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Beer, S., (1972) Brain of the firm, allen lane, , The Penguin Press, London; Brabandere, L., (2005), pp. 52-55. , False endings, weak signals; putting together the odd pieces of information that could save your business, Across the Board; Coffman, B., Weak signals research (1997) Part I: introduction, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak signals research (1997) Part II: information theory, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak signal research (1997) Part IV: evolution and growth of the weak signal to maturity, journal of transition management, , MG Taylor Corporation; Daheim, C., Uerz, T., Corporate foresight in Europe: from trend based logics to open foresight (2008) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 20 (3), pp. 321-336; Groddeck, V., Schwarz, J.O., Perceiving megatrends as empty signifiers: a discourse-theoretical interpretation of trend management (2013) Futures; Harris, D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals, detecting the next big thing (2002) The futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-2129; Heijden, K., (1997), Scenarios, Strategies, and the Strategy Process.

Temporal and spatial characteristics were examined to determine the dominant pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) variability from January 2003 to December 2011.The data were analysed from daily Level 1A (1km spatial resolution) to monthly composites Level 3 data using SeaDAS and ERDAS imagine software. Four modes was obtained from the analysis with the highest variance (7.9%) represented by mode 1 which explained the seasonal cycle. Mode 2 (5.11 % of total variance) showed positive and negative peak signal during March and April and in October and November with variability near the Kelantan and Pahang waters that indicated the inter monsoon. Mode 3 (3.8 % of variance) shows variability near the Terengganu, Kelantan and Johor waters to the open sea during July and August and in May and June representing the Southwest monsoon. Mode 4 (3.36 %) showed positive signal during November and December with strong signal near Pahang and Kelantan waters while weak signal was detected near Terengganu and Kelantan's open sea representing the Northeast monsoon. The SST variability was influenced by the monsoonal system which originated by the wind forcing condition that influences circulation in the study area. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.","Empirical orthogonal function (EOF); Exclusive Economic Zone; satellite imageries; Sea Surface Temperature",,,,,,"Dale, W.L., Wind and drift currents in the South China Sea (1956) The Malaysian Journal of Tropical Geography, 8, pp. 1-31; Jianyu, H., Kawamura, H., Hong, H., Qi, Y., A review on the currents in the South China Sea: Seasonal circulation, South China Sea warm current and Kuroshio Intrusion (2000) Journal of Oceanography, 55, pp. 607-624; Mao, Q.W., Shi, P., Qi, Y.Q., Sea surface dynamics topography of geostrophic current over the South China Sea from Geosat altimeter observation (1999) ActaOceanologica, 21 (1), pp. 11-16. , (in Chinese with English abstarct); Saadon, M.N., Camerlengo, A., Interannual and seasonal variability of the mixed layer depth of the South China Sea (1994) National Conference on Climate Change, , UPM; Shaw, P., Chao, S., Surface circulation in the South China Sea (1994) Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research, 41, pp. 1663-1683; Tangang, F., Xia, C., Qiao, F., Juneng, L., Shan, F., Seasonal circulations in the Malay Peninsula Eastern Continental Shelf from a wave-tide-circulation coupled model (2011) Ocean Dynamics, 61 (9), pp. 1317-1328; Akhir, M.F., Surface Circulation and Temperature Distribution of Southern South China Sea from Global Ocean Model (OCCAM) Peredaran Permukaandan TaburanSuhu Selatan Laut China Selatan melalui Model Lautan Global (OCCAM) (2012) Sains Malaysiana, 41 (6), pp. 701-714; Wyrtki, K., Physical oceanography of the Southeast Asian waters (1961) NAGA Report, 2. , (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, California); Xu, X.Z., Qui, Z., Chen, H.C., The general description of the horizontal circulation in the South China Sea (1982) Proceedings of the 19 880 Symposiums on Hydrometeorology of the Chinese Society of Oceanology and Limnology, , (Science Press, Beijing); Chelton, D.B., Esbensen, S.K., Schlax, M.G., Thum, N., Freilich, M.H., Wentz, F.J., Gentemann, C.L., Schopf, P.S., Observations of coupling between surface wind stress and sea surface temperature in the eastern tropical Pacific (2001) J.

These tools are integrated into an approach that encompasses the discovery of change, interpretation, and triggering managerial responses. The overall system consists of a tool for scanning for weak signals on change (PEACOQ Scouting Tool), a tool for collecting internal ideas (PEACOQ Gate 0.5), and a tool for triggering organizational responses (Foresight Landing page). Particularly the link to innovation management and R&D strategy is discussed in detail. We further report on the value creation and lessons learned that have accumulated over the last eight years throughout which the tools and approach have been built gradually. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate foresight; Innovation; IT tools; Scouting; Social networks; Web 2.0","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Corporate foresight; Deutsche telekom; Innovation management; Landing pages; Response systems; Scouting; Value creation; Web 2.0; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Vecchiato, R., Environmental uncertainty, foresight and strategic decision making: an integrated study (2012) Technol.

The theory postulates a set of technologies and practices that are unique to each wave. Although a challenge of the Kondratieff wave theory is great variance in interpretations about the timing of the waves among scholars, based on several analyses we suggest that with the financial crisis of 2008, and resulting economic instability, we are experiencing the end of the fifth wave and the emergence of the sixth. We take as our starting point the global trends, particularly those of scarcity and the rising cost of commodities such as energy and raw materials that have led to a widely shared hypothesis that resource productivity will be the key driver of technology and economic growth in the next wave. Socially, this driver will be fortified by growing environmental concerns since climate change and the destruction of natural ecosystems seem inevitably to proceed. Both these sources are boosting a generation of new companies and behaviour. In this article our focus is to evaluate weak signals that point to possible directions for the future of organisational practices in the sixth Kondratieff wave. We ask what will be the effects of the changing socio-technical landscape on the working life and organisational culture. The K-waves theory explains how certain ways of organising that have so far developed in the fringes of organisational culture may move into the mainstream, as a product of the systemic restructuring that has often accompanied the new K-wave. We present our findings from a workshop with representatives of five different resource efficiency oriented organisations in the Silicon Valley area. Based on the data we have gathered through the workshop and complementing interviews, we show how organisations base their considerations about the future to a surprisingly large extent on ethical arguments. Our material also includes a case that shows that this ethical approach is not self-evidently related to the aim for resource efficiency. We evaluate our results in the Future Sign - framework presented by Hiltunen. The signals we have gathered are combined with corporate shared value - thinking, and both are interpreted through the Kondratieff - wave theory. Based on our sample of five cases, along with a framework that supports our interpretation, we suggest the ethical motivations as backbone of organisations is a relatively strong future sign that has potential for strengthening in the sixth wave context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Ethics; Future sign; Kondratieff waves; Resource efficiency; Sixth wave; Social change","economic growth; economic instability; economic theory; ethics; future prospect; socioeconomic conditions; technological development; theoretical study",,,,,"(2014), http://www.ge.com/about-us/ecomagination, See; (2014), http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/, See; (2014), http://rt.com/usa/google-billion-solar-power-457/, See; (2014), http://www.givesomethingback.com/; (2014), http://www.newleafpaper.com/; (2014), http://www.shareable.net/; (2014), https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome; (2014), http://www.vinestove.com/; Arthur, W.B., The second economy (2011) McKinsey Quarterly, , https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/The_second_economy_2853; Ayres, R.U., Technological transformations long waves part I (1990) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 36, pp. 111-137; Ayres, R.U., Technological transformations long waves part II (1990) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 37, pp. 1-37; Barnosky, A.D., Hadly, E.A., Bascompte, J., Berlow, E.L., Brown, J.H., Fortelius, M., Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere (2012) Nature, 486, pp. 52-58; Braudel, F., (1996) The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II, , University of California Press, Berkeley; Brynjolfsson, E., McAfee, A., (2011) Race against the machine: How the digital revolution is accelerating innovation, driving productivity, and irreversibly transforming employment and the economy, , Digital Frontier Press, Lexington, Mass; Dator, J., From tsunamis to long waves and back (1999) Futures, 31 (1); Dator, J., Alternative futures for K-waves (2006) Kondratieff waves, warfare and world security, pp. 311-317. , IOS Press, Amsterdam, T.C.

What lies beneath the spate of recent RIS3s, in terms of specialization options as well as of the processes through which the latter were reached, is only now beginning to be examined in depth. Notably, the Commission did not offer a proper blueprint for RIS3-making, but opted instead to suggest a wide range of possible instruments. Based on our experience with the Romanian strategy-building process, in this article we outline a foresight-based toolkit for smart specialization and entrepreneurial discovery, though we too stop short of proposing a detailed full-fledged blueprint. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Data analytics; Delphi; Entrepreneurial discovery; Large-scale foresight; Smart specialization; Weak signals","Delphi analysis; entrepreneur; European Commission; strategic approach; Europe",,,,,"Aghion, P., David, P.A., Foray, D., Science, technology and innovation for economic growth: linking policy research and practice in ‘STIG Systems’ (2009) Research Policy, 38, pp. 681-693; Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Collins, H., Tacit and explicit knowledge (2010), University of Chicago Press Chicago; Day, G.S., Schoemaker, P.J.H., Scanning the periphery (2005) Harvard Business Review, 83, pp. 144-148; Dufva, M., Ahlqvist, T., Elements in the construction of future-orientation: a systems view of foresight (2015) Futures, 73, pp. 112-125; http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20-%20EN%20version.pdf, EC (European Commission), EUROPE 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, Brussels, 2010, accessed at; (2012), http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=e50397e3-f2b1-4086-8608-7b86e69e8553, EC (European Commission), Guide to Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS 3), May accessed at; Foray, D., The economic fundamentals of smart specialization (2013) Ekonomiaz, 83 (2), pp. 55-78; Foray, D., Smart specialization: opportunities and challenges for regional innovation policy (2015), Routledge London; Foray, D., Goenaga, X., The Goals of Smart Specialisation S3 Policy Brief Series, no. 1/2013.

Centimeter-wavelength data accumulated with existing radio telescopes (such as the RATAN-600 reflector—the largest radio telescope in Russia) are presented, and expected problems for major new radio telescopes of the 21st century, such as the Square Kilometer Array, are discussed. The effectiveness of using certain tested methods to derive astrophysically important results through reasonable statistical processing of large datasets is shown. In experiments conducted with RATAN-600, these methods lead to an enhancement in sensitivity by an order of magnitude compared with the sensitivity of a resolving element. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,"Berlin, A.B., Pariiskii, Y.N., Nizhelskii, N.A., Mingaliev, M.G., Tsybulev, P.G., Kratov, D.V., Udovitskiy, R.Y., Pylypenko, A.M., (2012) Astrophys.

An important aspect within the innovation process, is technology planning. The Heinz Nixdorf Institute developed a technology planning concept, which is supported by an Innovation-Database. The Innovation-Database synchronizes aspects from the market pull and the technology push. Furthermore, it is used as a knowledge management system for innovations and technologies. The challenge is filling the technology pool with a minimum set of technologies in order to use the whole functionality of the Innovation-Database. Many resources are needed in order to fill the technology pool or to update it. There is in increase in information in the World Wide Web and most of the information is fuzzy. Our approach is to identify them automatically by using crawler technologies. Therefore a software tool was developed, which automatically crawls for technologies in the database of the European Patent Office and in the journal database IEEE Xplore. In these data sources, the tool identifies technologies automatically in natural texts, prepares the data and visualize them. It is not suitable to scan a text for a defined set of technologies in a dictionary, because then the tool is not able to find new technologies or to detect weak signals. In this paper, the architecture and features of the software tool is described. It uses text mining methods to detect technologies in unstructured, fuzzy data. As input data, the user has to provide a search field, which the search is performed for. Furthermore, the data sources have to be defined. The tool crawls these data sources in order to identify technologies, which can be relevant for a given search field. The tool suggests newly identified technologies for the search field, which are generally relevant. The user has to decide whether those technologies are important for him. This information is used as feedback for the text-mining model to improve the precision of future analyses. In order to support the user, a suggested technology is automatically provided with further information, like a description and an estimation of technological maturity. With this information a user can start an evaluation of the technology. For every technology a datasheet is created with detail information. It can easily be customized for specific demands.

Engineers/Stakeholders are left in the position of being caught between the ideal of reducing risk to the lowest possible level and the reality of having to pay for the barriers and controls that reduce risks. High hazard industries such as high explosives manufacturing operations need a methodology for integrating feedback, economics and risk. The systems analysis being proposed uses causal loops to represent feedback, 20-year life cycle analysis to estimate economic costs and an existing hazard analysis with published risk factors. The model implies that a strong response to weak signals is cost effective and valuable for preventing catastrophic events. The resulting methodology successfully demonstrates that risk and cost models can be linked using systems tools to yield improved decision making.","Causal loops; Feedback; Risk analysis; Safety costs; System safety","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision making; Economic analysis; Feedback; Hazards; Life cycle; Reliability analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Systems analysis; Catastrophic event; Causal loops; Hazard industries; Life cycle analysis; Manufacturing operations; Operating environment; Safety costs; System safety; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,"Bromley, M.W., McElwain, K., Ng, E.-H., Simonton, J., Beruvides, M., High reliability operations: Systems dynamic and economic analysis modeling of B&W (now CNS) pantex plant high explosive operations (2011) Annual International Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management, pp. 343-349; McElwain, K., Bromley, M., Cantu, J., Tolk, J., Patterson, P., Simonton, J., Beruvides, M., Using quantitative analysis to establish a basis for high reliability organizations (2012) Annual International Conference of the American Society of Engineering Management, pp. 797-805; Beruvides, M., Tolk, J., McElwain, K., Bromley, M., Cantu, J., Patterson, P., Simonton, J., High reliability operations: Systems dynamic and economic analysis modeling of CNS pantex plant high explosive operations (2013) A Report to the Consolidated Nuclear Security Pantex Plant, , Amarillo, Tx; Beruvides, M., McElwain, K., Bromley, M., Cantu, J., (2014) Systems Dynamic and Economic Analysis, , Technical Report submitted by Texas Tech University Industrial Engineering Department Laboratory for Systems Solutions to CNS Pantex Plant, Amarillo, Tx; Woods, D.D., Hollnagel, E., (2006) Prologue: Resilience Engineering Concepts, Resilience Engineering: Concepts and Precepts, , (eds: E Hollnagel, D D Woods and N Leveson) (Ashgate Publishing: Aldershot); Hartley, R.S., Tolk, J.N., Swaim, D.J., (2008) Introduction to Pantex High Reliability Operations: A Practical Approach to Avoid the System Accident, , B&W Pantex, Amarillo, Texas; Canada, J.R., Sullivan, W.G., Kulonda, D.J., White, J.A., (2005) Capital Investment Analysis for Engineering and Management, 3rd Edition, , New Jersey: Pearson Education",,,"","Institute of Industrial Engineers","IIE Annual Conference and Expo 2015","30 May 2015 through 2 June 2015",,119457,,9780983762447,,,"English","IIE Annu.

This was followed up in 1995 with the first permanent array over Foinaven (FARM - Foinaven Active Reservoir Monitoring) which acquired a monitor survey in 1998. A streamer survey soon followed in 1999 which matched the existing 3D of 1993 and resulted in the first large at scale 4D project to investigate. After those initial experiments, no one could have envisaged the level to which the industry has now applied the technology. Since that time BP has acquired over 100 4D monitor surveys over a variety of fields in the North Sea. The 4D experience covers a wide variety of geological settings, from a hard concrete like sea bottom at Clair, to a relatively soft sea bottom at Valhall, from flat sea floor to dipping (Schiehallion) or even rugose (Skarv). We have gained a great deal of experience of both towed streamer and OBS 4D, in some areas it has worked particularly well, and in others, less so, from strong to weak signals, amplitudes and time shifts. In this paper we give an overview of our experiences and where we see the direction of future applications. © Copyright 2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Ocean structures; Petroleum engineering; Seismology; Surveys; Future applications; Geological setting; Pressure signal; Reservoir monitoring; Sea bottom; Seismic datas; Time shifts; Weak signals; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",,,,,,,,"","Society of Petroleum Engineers","SPE Offshore Europe Conference and Exhibition, OE 2015","8 September 2015 through 11 September 2015",,118476,,9781613993989,,,"English","Soc.

While companies are compelled to manage exploration projects, the processes underlying the expansion of knowledge in these projects are not well known. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the literature, this paper first presents a conceptual view of the notion of expert. Then, the research question is analyzed by means of a case study of a polar expedition. The project leader seeks a knowledgeable person who has never been identified as an expert, but whose knowledge is essential. Findings – The expert appears both in his cognitive and social dimensions. Moreover, he emerges out of the situation, on the basis of neither strong nor weak signals. The rationality of expert solicitation falls within a pragmatic logic where the acquired knowledge must reduce the uncertainty so that the project can progress. The learning process enables to increase gradually the knowledge of the actor but also to build the legitimacy required in order to have access to the expert. Practical implications – Findings can be translated in more general situations. Indeed, polar expeditions projects and exploratory innovation projects (Garel and Lièvre, 2010) possess some common characteristics: lack of knowledge concerning, timing issues, need to implement a pragmatic, enquiry-based learning. These projects strongly rely on external expert knowledge. This case study suggests that, while it may be useful, planning should not strictly define the course of action. A central competence of the project leader is to manage the duality between planning and adaptation. This implies the ability to adapt, to detect and to assess human resources and knowledge flows rapidly, as well as to weave social links inside and outside the organisation. Originality/value – The existing literature offers a comprehensive view of experts in an organisation. However, the questions of expert selection and identification remain open. This paper fills a gap in the literature concerning the way experts are identified and selected. The case study shows that identifying experts does not solely depend on weak signals (reputation) or on strong signals (the expert’s social status). Rather, the expert emerges in the situation, in an unexpected way. The expert’s social dimension is not sufficient and one must look to the cognitive roots of the expertise. On the other hand, the fact is emphasised that the expert is a social construct which emerges from the solicitation process. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Experts; Knowledge; Learning; Project management; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Amin, A., Cohendet, P., (2004) Architectures of Knowledge, Firms, Communities and Competencies, , andOxford University Press, Oxford:; Ancori, B., Expertise et citoyenneté: les Grecs anciens et nous (2009) Revue d’anthropologie des connaissances, 3 (1), pp. 485-529. , , Vol.No., pp; Belleval, C., Deniaud, I., Lerch, C., A model for the management of design project issues: the case of the microsatellites design (2010) International Journal of Design and Innovation Research, 5 (1). , and, Vol.No; Ben Mahmoud-Jouini, S., Charue-Duboc, F., Enhancing discontinuous innovation through knowledge combination: the case of an exploratory unit within an established automotive firm (2008) Creativity and Innovation Management, 17 (2), pp. 127-135. , and, Vol.No., pp; Bootz, J.P., Schenk, E., Comment gérer les experts au sein et en dehors des communautés?

However, investigations still tend to focus on technological and managerial deficiencies rather than probing deeper into the causes of human error. Nonetheless, facilitated by organisations such as International Oil and Gas Producers Association (OGP), there is a growing desire to understand human and organisational factors that influence potential process safety incidents during drilling and completion operations. A workshop was held in London in October 2014 to define and clarify the underlying ideas about human factors related to the drilling community. The objectives of the workshop were: • Introducing the concepts behind human factors and key definitions • Highlighting the effects of human factors in drilling operations • Operationalising human factors and the impact of the introduction of new technology • Implementing training and assessment of non-technical skills • Taking human factors into the mainstream of drilling operations Attendees at the workshop discussed the principles underlying the psychological concepts of human factors, such as non-technical skills, cognitive bias, weak signals and chronic unease, as well as socio-technical systems and the impact of automation. Examples of how the influences of human factors may be recognised in routine drilling operations and how biases affect decision-making were examined. Practical applications of human factors techniques were described, along with methods currently being implemented to train and assess non-technical skills. The workshop culminated in a debate about how to operationalise human factors in drilling operations. The main points to emerge from the presentations and ensuing discussions are summarised and references are provided for further reading. Practical tools and insights that can be applied in day-to-day operations are also presented. In conclusion, workshop presenters and attendees, whilst acknowledging the importance of human factors on drilling operations, also recognised the challenges yet to be overcome in implementing human factors principles in the workplace. However, there are some positive signs of growing acceptance and influences. By facilitating open dialogue about human factors in drilling the goal is to encourage progress towards human factors integration being the norm rather than the exception.

Anticipating such changes can however be difficult given the profusion and complexity of data and when signals indicating future risks and opportunities may be weak. To tackle this challenge, the French Environment ministry asked a research team at AgroParisTech to develop a new method for identifying emerging issues for biodiversity policies by 2020 in France (except for overseas territories). This project, called BioPIQuE 2013, involved both scientists and stakeholders in an interdisciplinary assessment. As a result, 25 emerging issues were identified, among which 10 issues were highlighted for their strategic interest. A majority of these issues are current trends not yet taken into account by biodiversity policies (such as ""why do we have to and how can we improve our ability to restore-with ambitious biodiversity objectives-urbanised and highly degraded areas?""), and a few of them are weak signals (such as ""how can we deal with trade-offs and conflicts between biodiversity policies and other environmental policies?""). All stakeholders, including researchers, NGOs, public administrations, private companies and politicians, can find in the results some inputs for developing their biodiversity conservation strategies. © NSS-Dialogues, EDP Sciences 2015.","Biodiversity; Emerging issues; Futures studies; Institutional arrangements; Public policies","biodiversity; conservation planning; environmental policy; institutional framework; interdisciplinary approach; strategic approach; France",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Könnölä, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., Van, R.V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39, pp. 208-221; Belna, K., Leménager, T., Mermet, L., Évaluer l'efficacité de politiques et programmes environnementaux: quel cadrage proposer Le cas du Fonds de partenariat pour le carbone forestier (2012) Notes Méthodologiques N 5, Agence Française de Développement., , http://www.afd.fr/webdav/site/afd/shared/PUBLICATIONS/RECHERCHE/Evaluations/Notes-methodologiques/05-notes-methodologiques.pdf; Chateauraynaud, F., Les lanceurs d'alerte dans l'espace politique.

Box 16500, Aalto, FI 00076, Finland","Growing flexibility in work arrangements, particularly in the knowledge industries, and the ensuing possibilities for teleworking are challenging the traditional ways of conceptualizing and designing public spaces and public services. As an example of this development, public and university libraries are studied from the point of view of teleworking. Although work still only accounts for a small amount of the activities that take place in libraries, its transformations can be seen as a 'weak signal' of newly emerging spatial arrangements. In addition to the home and workplace, teleworkers are using a network of public, semi-public and private spaces (so-called third places) for different types of working. The research used the concept ""spatial portfolio"" to address this phenomenon of spatial modalities. The new role of public libraries within this context is discussed. In addition to their traditional functions of lending books and providing spaces for reading newspapers and magazines, libraries are now becoming more multifunctional, providing space for different activities, including work. This new phenomenon has been studied empirically by conducting a qualitative interview and observing teleworkers in two public libraries and one university library in the City of Helsinki, Finland. The objective was to find and analyze different profiles of workers in libraries, thus providing input for future planning and design of these spaces, as well as the urban fabric around them. The results show that a considerable range of activities within research and education, art and culture, information technology, business and finance, and social services and government are performed in the libraries, all of which are in part supported by the new concepts and policies of the city. Libraries can be seen as 'transitory workspaces' where people work at least a couple of hours per week and for different reasons such as free wifi connection and location. Also, libraries might be considered 'spatial incubators' or rather places able to attract people who start up their own activities. These concepts contribute to define a new way of appropriating libraries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,"Aabø, S., Audunson, R., Use of library space and the library as place (2012) Library and Information Science Research, 34, pp. 138-149; Appelbaum, E., Batt, R., (1994) The new American workplace: Transforming work systems in the United States, , Cornell University Press, New York, NY; Augé, M., (1995) Non-places: Introduction to an anthropology of super modernity, , Verso, London, UK; (2008) Augmented urban spaces, , Ashgate Publishing Company, Burlington, VT, A.

A variety of psychophysical factors affect the quality of vigilance performance and vigilance tasks are mentally demanding and stressful. After considering the historical roots and current importance of vigilance research, this chapter will describe the psychophysical, workload, and stress elements associated with the maintenance of sustained attention and consider recent developments in theoretical models used to account for vigilance performance. The chapter will conclude with some suggestions for the translation of basic research knowledge to vigilance performance in operational settings. Historical Background The term “vigilance” was coined by Sir Henry Head (1923), who used it to refer to a state of maximum physiological and psychological readiness to react. Early research on this topic was conducted by the British Industrial Fatigue Board in the production and inspection of ammunition during World War I (Vernon, 1921) and by Wyatt and Langdon (1932), who described time-related variations in the performance of inspectors examining cartridge cases for flaws prior to packaging. However, controlled laboratory research on sustained attention is generally considered to have begun during World War II. It was stimulated by surprising fallibility in the performance of British airborne radar observers while on patrol for enemy submarines. Despite extensive training and high motivation to perform well, the observers failed to notice the weak signals on their pulse-position radar displays signifying the presence of enemy submarines on the surface of the sea below, particularly toward the end of the watch. As a result, the submarines were free to prey on British ships. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,,,,,"Aaslid, R., Transcranial doppler examination techniques (1986) Transcranial Doppler Sonography, pp. 39-59. , R.

There are also an increasing number of people trying to find out exactly what this concept means, as well as when and how to use it. Such questions arise particularly when it comes down to making strategic decisions. To help with these questions, this book defines the concept of the ""weak signal"" and then demonstrates how it would be useful in relation to strategic decisions, and more precisely in relation to three moments of the strategic decision, i.e.: - The trigger of the strategic decision (what is the trigger, why and when) - The development of the strategic decision - The implementation of the strategic decision. © ISTE Ltd 2014.

It enables to predict the appearance of events in advance that are relevant for an organization. An example is to predict the appearance of a new and relevant technology for a research organization. Existing approaches detect weak signals based on an environmental scanning procedure that considers textual information from the internet. This is because about 80% of all data in the internet are textual information. The texts are processed by a specific clustering approach where clusters that represent weak signals are identified. In contrast to these related approaches, we propose a new methodology that investigates a sequence of clusters measured at successive points in time. This enables to trace the development of weak signals over time and thus, it enables to identify relevant weak signal developments for organization's decision making in strategic early warning environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We assume both p and n are large, including the case of p &gt; n. The unknown signal vector β is assumed to be sparse in the sense that only a small fraction of its components is nonzero. The goal is to identify such nonzero coordinates (i.e., variable selection). We are primarily interested in the regime where signals are both rare and weak so that successful variable selection is challenging but is still possible. We assume the Gram matrix G = X'X is sparse in the sense that each row has relatively few large entries (diagonals of G are normalized to 1). The sparsity of G naturally induces the sparsity of the socalled Graph of Strong Dependence (GOSD). The key insight is that there is an interesting interplay between the signal sparsity and graph sparsity: in a broad context, the signals decompose into many small-size components of GOSD that are disconnected to each other. We propose Graphlet Screening for variable selection. This is a two-step Screen and Clean procedure, where in the first step, we screen subgraphs of GOSD with sequential χ2-tests, and in the second step, we clean with penalized MLE. The main methodological innovation is to use GOSD to guide both the screening and cleaning processes. For any variable selection procedure βC, we measure its performance by the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of βC and β, and assess the optimality by the minimax Hamming distance. Compared with more stringent criteria such as exact support recovery or oracle property, which demand strong signals, the Hamming distance criterion is more appropriate for weak signals since it naturally allows a small fraction of errors. We show that in a broad class of situations, Graphlet Screening achieves the optimal rate of convergence in terms of the Hamming distance. Unlike Graphlet Screening, wellknown procedures such as the L0/L1-penalization methods do not utilize local graphic structure for variable selection, so they generally do not achieve the optimal rate of convergence, even in very simple settings and even if the tuning parameters are ideally set. The the presented algorithm is implemented as R-CRAN package ScreenClean and in matlab (available at http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jiashun/Research/software/GS-matlab/). © 2014 Jiashun Jin, Cun-Hui Zhang, and Qi Zhang.","Asymptotic minimaxity; Graph of least favorables (GOLF); Graph of Strong Dependence (GOSD); Graphlet screening (GS); Hamming distance; Phase diagram; Rare and weak signal model; Screen and Clean; Sparsity","Phase diagrams; Graph of least favorables (GOLF); Graphlet screening (GS); Minimaxity; Sparsity; Strong dependences; Weak signals; Hamming distance",,,,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans.

We argue for the benefits of an alternative method that views uncertainty as originating from indeterminism. We develop and illustrate an 'antifragile' approach to preparing for the future and present it as a step-by-step, non-deterministic methodology that can be used as a replacement for, or as a complement to, the causally-focused approach of scenario planning. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Causality; Fragility; Indeterminism; Intuitive Logics; Scenario planning; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37, pp. 795-812; Evans, S.K., Connecting adaptation and strategy: the role of evolutionary theory in scenario planning (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 460-468; Chermack, T.J., Swanson, R.A., Scenario planning: human resource development's strategic learning tool (2008) Adv.

Such systems frequently undergo regime shifts. Combining insights from bifurcation theory in nonlinear dynamics and the theory of critical transitions in statistical physics, we know that critical slowing down and critical fluctuations occur close to such regime shifts. In this paper, we show how universal precursors expected from such critical transitions can be used to forecast regime shifts in the US housing market. In the housing permit, volume of homes sold and percentage of homes sold for gain data, we detected strong early warning signals associated with a sequence of coupled regime shifts, starting from a Subprime Mortgage Loans transition in 2003-2004 and ending with the Subprime Crisis in 2007-2008. Weaker signals of critical slowing down were also detected in the US housing market data during the 1997-1998 Asian Financial Crisis and the 2000-2001 Technology Bubble Crisis. Backed by various macroeconomic data, we propose a scenario whereby hot money flowing back into the US during the Asian Financial Crisis fueled the Technology Bubble. When the Technology Bubble collapsed in 2000-2001, the hot money then flowed into the US housing market, triggering the Subprime Mortgage Loans transition in 2003-2004 and an ensuing sequence of transitions. We showed how this sequence of couple transitions unfolded in space and in time over the whole of US. © 2014 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Asian financial crisis; Bifurcation theory; Critical fluctuations; Critical slowing down; Housing markets; Nonlinear interactions; Statistical and Nonlinear Physics; Statistical physics; Bifurcation (mathematics); Commerce; Housing",,,,,"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_bearstearns.htm, Bear Stearns, JPMorgan Chase, and Maiden Lane LLC accessed: 2013-06-17; http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/1099/conservatorship21709.pdf, Statement of FHFA Director James B.

The paper highlights the organisational variables that characterise a CF organisation (organisational definition, specialisation and mechanisms of internal cohesion) and relates them to CF performance measures (effectiveness and efficiency).For increasing CF performance, companies need to define a peculiar system for foresight, more ""structural"" or more ""cultural"", to specialise for foresight, to build a control system for procedures and to model internal and external relationships. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate foresight; Multiple case study; Organisational design; Telecommunications","Telecommunication; Telecommunication industry; Corporate foresight; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Internal and external relationships; Internal cohesion; Multiple-case study; Organisational; Organisational designs; Performance measure; Research; corporate strategy; industrial performance; telecommunication",,,,,"Becker, P., (2002) Corporate Foresight in Europe: A First Overview, , Institution for Science and Technology Studies, Bielefeld; Day, G., Schoemaker, P., Driving through the fog: managing at the edge (2004) Long Range Plan., 37 (2); Müller, A., (2008) Strategic foresight in companies, , (phd thesis), University of St. Gallen; Sarpong, D., Maclean, M., Mobilising differential visions for new product innovation (2012) Technovation, 32 (12), pp. 694-702; Wack, P., Scenarios: shooting the rapids (1985) Harv.

Since such a setting enhances creativity and perception, it has been identified as a means to develop new products, services, and business models. Novelty starts with weak signals of change within an environment and leads to innovations. From a constructivist perspective, in which knowledge needs to be processed or ""constructed"", weak signals of change are not perceived by the outside environment. Rather, they have to be conceptualized in a cognitive process. We use this theoretical perspective to illustrate the value of novels in identifying and cognitively conceptualizing weak signals. With the support of sense-making theory, we illustrate how novels contribute to comprehending novelty in two frames of reference: by broadening the perspective, enhancing the creativity, and increasing the sensitivity of managers/corporate decision makers to detect weak signals; and by ensuring that the customer comprehends the link of an SF prototype to a future product or service. Our theoretical considerations are illustrated by an example from the novel, Super Sad True Love Story, in which the SF prototype is part of a broader fictional story. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Frames of reference; Novels; Science fiction prototyping; Sense-making; Trend; Weak signals","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Frames of reference; Novels; Science fictions; Sensemaking; Trend; Weak signals; Decision theory; cognition; decision making; innovation; research; science and technology; trend analysis",,,,,"Harris, S.D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals: detecting the next big thing (2002) Futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-28; Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Calif.

Here, we consider instead informal and unobservable networks. The paper explores how hidden informal exchanges can impact upon organisational decision-making and performance, particularly around inter-agency working, as knowledge distributed across organisations and shared between organisations is often shared through informal means and not captured effectively through the formal decision-making processes. Early warnings and weak signals about potential risks and crises are therefore often missed. We consider the implications of these dynamics in terms of crisis avoidance and crisis management. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","control; crisis; informal networks; organisational performance; risk",,,,,,"Ackroyd, S., Thompson, P., (1999) Organizational Misbehaviour, , London, SAGE; Argyris, C., (1990) Overcoming Organizational Defences.

Some of the most urgent challenges facing those responsible for improving and regulating patient safety are therefore how to identify, interpret, integrate and act on the early warnings and weak signals of emerging risks - before those risks contribute to a disastrous failure of care. These challenges are fundamentally organisational and cultural: they relate to what information is routinely noticed, communicated and attended to within and between healthcare organisations - and, most critically, what is assumed and ignored. Analysing these organisational and cultural challenges suggests three practical ways that healthcare organisations and their regulators can improve safety and address emerging risks. First, engage in practices that actively produce and amplify fleeting signs of ignorance. Second, work to continually define and update a set of specific fears of failure. And third, routinely uncover and publicly circulate knowledge on the sources of systemic risks to patient safety and the improvements required to address them.",,"disaster medicine; disaster planning; health care organization; health care quality; human; knowledge; learning; patient safety; review",,,,,"(2009) Investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, , Healthcare Commission.

Since lone wolves are acting on their own, information about them cannot be collected using traditional police methods such as infiltration or wiretapping. One way to attempt to discover them before it is too late is to search for various ""weak signals"" on the Internet, such as digital traces left in extremist web forums. With the right tools and techniques, such traces can be collected and analyzed.

The CRIOP method has been suggested and validated in a project in the space domain. The goal of the project was to develop an integrated human dependability model. The CRIOP method is focusing on human operations, through control centres or control cabins. The method has been adapted to learn from successful recoveries and accidents to improve human dependability. The method tries to ensure that key issues are identified early. It is suggested to build resilience through organisational and system design and support teamwork as a key factor in improving resilience. This should be done through learning from incidents and recoveries, through scenario discussions exploring critical tasks and human machine interfaces from design.

Here, we investigated the signature of local adaptation over a short spatial scale using 96 European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) individuals originating from two pairs of populations on the northern and southern slopes of Mont Ventoux (south-eastern France). We performed both single and multilocus analysis of selection based on 53 climate-related candidate genes containing 546 SNPs. FST outlier methods at the SNP level revealed a weak signal of selection, with three marginally significant outliers in the northern populations. At the gene level, considering haplotypes as alleles, two additional marginally significant outliers were detected, one on each slope. To account for the uncertainty of haplotype inference, we averaged the Bayes factors over many possible phase reconstructions. Epistatic selection offers a realistic multilocus model of selection in natural populations. Here, we used a test suggested by Ohta based on the decomposition of the variance of linkage disequilibrium. Overall populations, 0.23% of the SNP pairs (haplotypes) showed evidence of epistatic selection, with nearly 80% of them being within genes. One of the between gene epistatic selection signals arose between an FST outlier and a nonsynonymous mutation in a drought response gene. Additionally, we identified haplotypes containing selectively advantageous allele combinations which were unique to high or low elevations and northern or southern populations. Several haplotypes contained nonsynonymous mutations situated in genes with known functional importance for adaptation to climatic factors. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","abiotic stress; budburst phenology; FST outlier; gene network; haplotype; Ohta's test; variance components of linkage disequilibrium","microsatellite DNA; plant DNA; abiotic stress; acclimatization; allele; article; Bayes theorem; beech; biological model; budburst phenology; climate change; DNA sequence; epistasis; France; FST outlier; Gene network; genetic selection; genetics; haplotype; Ohta's test; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; variance components of linkage disequilibrium; abiotic stress; budburst phenology; FST outlier; gene network; haplotype; Ohta's test; variance components of linkage disequilibrium; Acclimatization; Alleles; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; DNA, Plant; Epistasis, Genetic; Fagus; France; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA","GENBANK: AB012776, EU790701, KM001945:KM002144, KM002145:KM002192",,,,"Alberto, F.J., Aitken, S.N., Alía, R., Potential for evolutionary responses to climate change: Evidence from tree populations (2013) Global Change Biology, 19, pp. 1645-1661; Alberto, F.J., Derory, J., Boury, C., Frigerio, J.-M., Zimmermann, N.E., Kremer, A., Imprints of natural selection along environmental gradients in phenology-related genes of Quercus petraea (2013) Genetics, 195, pp. 495-512; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) Journal of Molecular Biology, 215, pp. 403-410; Audigeos, D., Brousseau, L., Traissac, S., Scotti-Saintagne, C., Scotti, I., Molecular divergence in tropical tree populations occupying environmental mosaics (2013) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 26, pp. 529-544; Beaumont, M.A., Nichols, R.A., Evaluating loci for use in the genetic analysis of population structure (1996) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 263, pp. 1619-1626; Black, W.C., Gorrochetegui-Escalante, N., Randle, N.P., Donnelly, M.J., The Yin and Yang of linkage disequilibrium: Mapping of genes and nucleotides conferring insecticide resistance in insect disease vectors (2008) Transgenesis and the Management of Vector-Borne Disease, pp. 71-83. , (ed.

Considerable research works have proven particles to be useful carriers in many bead-based bioassays. The increasing use of colloidal systems raises demands for a versatile tool capable of performing multiple functions. To this end, this paper presents a simple optoelectrokinetic method for manipulating particles by simultaneously inducing electrohydrodnamic flow and electrokinetic motions. With carefully tuning the balance between several forces acting on particles, manipulation capabilities including aggregation, translation, sorting, and patterning were achieved. The experimental results showed that the technique is subjected to frequency, electric voltage, laser intensity, and particle size. For a proof of concept, the technique was used to enhance the weak signal of a dilute biotin solution by concentrating streptavidin coated particles. Compared with a ELISA reader, the minimal readout was 100 fold improvement. The demonstration provides a good insight to the future biochemical applications. © 14CBMS.","Bead-based bioassay; Colloidal particles; Optoelectrokinetics; Signal enhancement","Bioassay; Colloids; Particle size; Proteins; Screening; Bead-based; Bio-chemical applications; Colloidal particle; Electric voltage; Laser intensities; Multiple function; Optoelectrokinetics; Signal enhancement; Agglomeration",,,,,"Teste, B., Ali-Cherif, A., Viovy, J.L., Malaquin, L., A low cost and high throughput magnetic bead-based immu-no-agglutination assay in confined droplets (2013) Lab Chip, 13, pp. 2344-2349; Hwang, H., Park, J.K., Optoelectrofluidic platforms for chemistry and biology (2011) Lab Chip, 11, pp. 33-47; Kumar, A., Williams, S.J., Chuang, H.S., Green, N.G., Wereley, S.T., Hybrid opto-electric manipulation in microfluidics - Opportunities and challenges (2011) Lab Chip, 11, pp. 2135-2148; Williams, S.J., Kumar, A., Wereley, S.T., Electrokinetic patterning of colloidal particles with optical landscapes (2008) Lab Chip, 8, pp. 1879-1882","Chuang, H.S.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Cheng Kung UniversityTaiwan",,"Analytical Chemistry;CBMS;Indiana University (IU);Institute of Microchemical Technology (IMT);LPKF Laser and Electronics","Chemical and Biological Microsystems Society","18th International Conference on Miniaturized Systems for Chemistry and Life Sciences, MicroTAS 2014","26 October 2014 through 30 October 2014",,113844,,9780979806476,,,"English","Int.

In a series of works, it was suggested that these QPOs may have connection to inhomogeneities orbiting close to an inner edge of the accretion disc. In this paper, we explore the appearance of an observable signal generated by small radiating circular hotspots moving along quasi-elliptic trajectories close to the innermost stable circular orbit in the Schwarzschild space-time. Our consideration takes into account the capabilities of observatories that have been operating in the past two decades represented by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the proposed future instruments represented by the Large Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT). For these purposes, we choose such model parameters that lead to light curves comparable to those observed in Galactic black hole sources, in particular the microquasar GRS 1915+105. We find that when a weak signal corresponding to the hotspot Keplerian frequency is around the limits of the RXTE detectability, the LOFT observations can clearly reveal its first and second harmonics. Moreover, in some specific situations the radial epicyclic frequency of the spot can be detected as well. Finally, we also compare the signal produced by the spots to the signal produced by axisymmetric epicyclic disc-oscillation modes and discuss the key differences that could be identified via the proposed future technology.We conclude that the ability to recognize the harmonic content of the signal can help to distinguish between the different proposed physical models . © 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","Accretion, accretion discs; Binaries; Black hole physics; Gravitation; Methods: numerical; X-rays",,,,,,"Abramowicz, M.A., Kluźniak, W., (2001) A&A, 374, pp. L19; Abramowicz, M.A., Bao, G., Lanza, A., Zhang, X.-H., (1991) A&A, 245, p. 454; Abramowicz, M.A., Lanza, A., Spiegel, E.A., Szuszkiewicz, E., (1992) Nature, 356, p. 41; Abramowicz, M.A., Karas, V., Kluźniak, W., Lee, W.H., Rebusco, P., (2003) PASJ, 55, p. 466; Abramowicz, M.A., Bulik, T., Bursa, M., Kluźniak, W., (2003) A&A, 404, pp. L21; Alpar, M.A., Shaham, J., (1985) Nature, 316, p. 239; Bakala, P., Čermák, P., Hledík, S., Stuchlík, Z., Truparová, K., (2007) Cent.

Analysing safety related records and learning from 'touch and go' situations is one possible way of preventing hazardous conditions from occurring in both aviation and healthcare. The eventuality of an incident or an accident may markedly be reduced if the risks connected to it are efficiently diagnosed. With the aid of this outlook, flight safety has witnessed decades of successful improvement. Since aviation and healthcare share similarities, the methods for improving safety could be transferable between the domains. This paper explores how a data mining technique used in aviation to identify the weak signals of lethal trends can be applied to healthcare documentation.","Aviation; Aviation safety; Clustering; Hazardous event; Healthcare; Lethal trend; Patient safety; Risk management; Text mining; Weak signal","Aviation safety; Clustering; Hazardous events; Lethal trend; Patient safety; Text mining; Weak signals; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Health care; Risk management; Aviation",,,,,"Amalberti, R., Auroy, Y., Berwick, D., Barach, P., Five system barriers to achieving ultrasafe health care (2005) Annals of Internal Medicine, 142 (9), pp. 756-764; Ananyan, S., Goodfellow, M., (2004) New Capabilities of PolyAnalyst Text and Data Mining Applied to STEADES Data at the International Air Transport Association (IATA): A Technology Demonstration, , Global Aviation Information Network; Boaden, R., The contribution of quality management to patient safety (2006) Patient Safety: Research Into Practice, , K.

However, these concepts often go unused in practice. The 2008/2009 economic crisis provided a strong, ongoing impulse for redesigning such information systems (IS). This article develops six guidelines for the conceptual design of environmental scanning systems that are more applicable than those specified by previous research. We start with literature research, which reveals three gaps in existing approaches. Then we develop design guidelines to fill these gaps with the help of ""modern"" IS. To address the lack of sound requirements analysis, our first design principle proposes 360-degree environmental scanning systems for executives and suggests how to select the most important scanning areas. Three further findings cover weaknesses in the IS model perspective, focusing on more effective implications of weak signals. In terms of method, we propose incorporating scanning results more closely into executives' decision-making processes. Applying the design guidelines at a raw materials and engineering company, we arrive at a prototype we call the ""corporate radar."" It includes an IS-based tree with economic value added at risk on top. The resulting lessons learned help to evaluate our findings and the research method presented here, as well provide concrete starting points for future research. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","""Modern"" information system technology;

Travelling from a Strong Signal Area (SSA) to a Weak Signal Area (WSA) causes a significant drop in the mobile network bandwidth available to the device. This causes Quality of Service (QoS) problems for video streams over mobile networks. For a completely pause-less video stream, the average stream download rate must be consistently equal to, or greater than, the video bit-rate. A sudden bandwidth drop often causes the stream to rapidly become starved of buffered data, causing a pause in playback whilst the client attempts further buffering - posing a QoS problem. This paper proposes a solution that helps counter this mobility problem by attempting to foresee a user entering a WSA, and dynamically rate-limiting other nearby best-case users to increase available bandwidth to said user. Predictions are based on active user location information, and Mobile Network Coverage Map (MNCM) queries. Best-case user determination and dynamic rate-limit algorithms are described in this paper. Through mathematical proofing with two unique test scenarios, the proposed solution is proven to significantly improve QoS of a video stream to a user entering a WSA. © 2013 The Science and Information Organization.","mobile; QoS; quality; rate-limit; service; stream; video","mobile; rate-limit; service; stream; video; Bandwidth; Drops; Image quality; Video streaming; Quality of service",,,,,"(2011) Statistics, , http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics, Retrieved December 1, 2012, from; Newcomb, D., (2012) Which 2012 Cars Have the Best Tech?The Technology in These Vehicles Makes Life Easier and More Entertaining on the Road-not More Complicated., MSN Autos, , http://editorial.autos.msn.com/which-2012-cars-havethe-best-tech, Retrieved January 19, 2012, from; (2004) Vodafone Begins 3G Mobile Service, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3996971.stm, Retrieved December 1, 2012, from; (2012) 4GEE, , http://explore.ee.co.uk/4gee, Retrieved December 1, 2012, from; Quality of Service (QoS) Concept and Architecture, , 3GPP TS 23.107; (2012) Crowd-sourced Cellular Coverage Maps for the World, , http://opensignal.com, Retrieved December 2, 2012, from; Riiser, H., Vigmostad, P., Griwodz, C., Halvorsen, P., Bitrate and video quality planning for mobile streaming scenarios using a GPS-based bandwidth lookup service (2011) Proc. of ICME, , july; Curcio, V.V., Hannuksela, M., Geo-predictive real-time media delivery in mobile environment (2010) Proc. of Mobile Video Delivery, , soct; Ozer, J., (2009) H.264 Scalable Video Coding-what You Need to Know, , http://www.streaminglearningcenter.com/articles/h264-scalable- videocoding-what-you-need-to-know.html, Retrieved December 1, 2012, from; Tappayuthpijarn, K., Stockhammer, T., Steinbach, E., HTTP-based scalable video streaming over mobile networks (2011) Image Processing (ICIP), 2011 18th IEEE International Conference on, p. 2193. , 2196, 11-14 Sept; Singh, V., Ott, J., Curcio, I.D.D., Predictive buffering for streaming video in 3G networks (2012) World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM), 2012 IEEE International Symposium on a, p. 1. , 25-28 June, 10","University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, United Kingdom",,"The Science and Information (SAI) Organization;Springer",,"2013 Science and Information Conference, SAI 2013","7 October 2013 through 9 October 2013","London",101986,,9780989319300,,,"English","Proc.

The role of estradiol-17beta (E2) in differentiation of ovarian cells is well conserved across phyla; however, its role in development of ambisexual gonads is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the E2 produced during the differentiation of ovarian cells does not allow testicular cells to differentiate in the prospective ambisexual gonad. We examined the immunolocalization of the steroidogenic enzyme cytochrome aromatase (P450arom), which is involved in E2 production. In the gonads, numbers of the P450arom-positive cells increased during ovarian differentiation. However, immunopositive cells with weak signal intensity were seen in the interstitial areas among oocytes and between oocytes and testicular tissue undergoing testicular differentiation. In contrast, P450arom-positive cells were not found in any testicular tissues of the ambisexual gonads. We also examined changes in E2 production in vitro in the gonads during testicular differentiation. E2 was high in the ovaries before the appearance all of testicular tissue, and decreased accompanying the differentiation of testicular tissue. These results suggest a balance of estrogen/androgen seems to be important during sex differentiation, and then a shift from estrogen to androgen production may induce testicular differentiation in the ovary. Further, exogenous E2 treatment suppressed naturally occurring differentiation of testicular cells forming exclusively ovarian tissues in the gonad in vivo, suggesting the increase of estrogen blocks the differentiation of testicular tissue and the formation of ambisexual gonad. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Amphiprion clarkii;

In particular, risks associated with global supply chains are special since they involve a multitude of international stakeholders with different perspectives on security needs and measures. Therefore, it is essential to determine which techniques and instruments are best suited for risk assessment in complex and multi-organizational environments. The Delphi expert survey technique has proven to be a valuable instrument for long-term decision making support as well as foresight, and has a potential value for risk assessment. We contribute to this research strand and conduct a Delphi-based risk analysis. Our research concentrates on man-made risks in global supply chains which are particularly uncertain in terms of type, location, and affected supply chain partners and can therefore be classified as inherently ""wicked"" issues, i.e. issues that are multidimensional with often unpleasant outcomes. We illustrate that Delphi research makes a fivefold contribution to risk analysis by: (1) identifying and quantifying risks; (2) analyzing stakeholder perceptions and worldviews; (3) stimulating a global communication process; (4) identifying weak signals, outlier opinions, and wildcards; (5) and facilitating risk scenario development. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Risk; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks","Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks; Communication; Research; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Supply chains; Risk analysis; decision making; Delphi analysis; future prospect; perception; risk assessment; stakeholder; terrorism",,,,,"Thun, J.-H., Hoenig, D., An empirical analysis of supply chain risk management in the German automotive industry (2011) Int.

In foresight studies, usually their positive impact on the quality of life is considered or their negative environmental effects. This paper seeks to draw attention to an overlooked ""dark side"" of new technologies: their potential abuse by terrorists or organized crime. Recent cybercrime events are examples of abuse that perhaps could have been minimized if appropriate foresight studies were performed years ago. This was the aim of the recently completed EU-funded project FESTOS. Design/methodology/approach: Several foresight methodologies were employed. Following a horizon scanning for potentially threatening technologies, a Delphi-type expert survey helped to evaluate critical threat characteristics of selected 33 technologies: the likelihood that each technology will actually come to pose a security threat (in different time frames), the easiness of its malicious use, the severity of the threat, and the most threatened societal spheres. Findings: The results enabled ranking the technologies by their ""abuse potential"" and ""threat intensity"". Certain emerging technologies (or their combinations), regarded as ""weak signals"", inspired ideas for potential ""wild cards"". In a subsequent workshop, which employed a variant of the ""futures wheel"" method, four wild-card ""scenario sketches"" were constructed. These were later developed to full narrative scenarios. Originality/value: The entire process enables the introduction of security foresight into policy planning in a long-range perspective. The foresight results were followed by the evaluation of policy implications and coping with the knowledge control dilemma. The paper illustrates how a mix of foresight methods can help in a continuous analysis of new and threats posed by emerging technologies, thus raising awareness of decision makers and mitigating the risk of unforeseen surprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Emerging technologies; Foresight; Future threats; Security; Signals of change; Wild cards",,,,,,"Auffermann, B., Luoto, L., (2011) Integrated Security Threats Report, FESTOS Deliverable D3.3, , http://tinyurl.com/9auvja8, partners with contribution from all, available at; Brown, J., Isaacs, D., (2005) The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter, , Berrett-Koehler, San Francisco, CA; Dienel, H.L., Peperhove, R., (2011), Final Scenario and Indicators Report, FESTOS Deliverable D4.3; Glenn, J.C., (2009) The Futures Wheel, in Futures Research Methodology - V3.0, , Glenn, J.C., Gordon, T.J.

We developed microsatellite markers for the broadcast spawning gorgonian octocoral Eunicea (Plexaura) flexuosa (four markers) and its dinoflagellate symbiont, Symbiodinium B1 (five markers), and used them to assess genetic connectivity, specificity and directionality of gene flow among sites in Florida, Panama, Saba and the Dominican Republic. Bayesian analyses found that most E. flexuosa from the Florida reef tract, Saba and the Dominican Republic were strongly differentiated from many E. flexuosa in Panama, with the exception of five colonies from Key West that clustered with colonies from Panama. In contrast, Symbiodinium B1 was more highly structured. At least seven populations were detected that showed patterns of isolation by distance. The symbionts in the five unusual Key West colonies also clustered with symbionts from Panama, suggesting these colonies are the result of long-distance dispersal. Migration rate tests indicated a weak signal of northward immigration from the Panama population into the lower Florida Keys. As E. flexuosa clonemates only rarely associated with the same Symbiodinium B1 genotype (and vice versa), these data suggest a dynamic host-symbiont relationship in which E. flexuosa is relatively well dispersed but likely acquires Symbiodinium B1 from highly structured natal areas prior to dispersal. Once vectored by host larvae, these symbionts may then spread through the local population, and/or host colonies may acquire different local symbiont genotypes over time. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Caribbean; dispersal; octocoral; population genetics; specificity; Symbiodinium",,,,,,"Andras, J.P., Kirk, N.L., Drew Harvell, C.D., Range-wide population genetic structure of Symbiodinium associated with the Caribbean Sea fan coral, Gorgonia ventalina (2011) Molecular Ecology, 20, pp. 2525-2542; Andras, J.P., Rypien, K.L., Harvell, C.D., Range-wide population genetic structure of the Caribbean sea fan coral, Gorgonia ventalina (2013) Molecular Ecology, 22, pp. 56-73; Aurelle, D., Ledoux, J.B., Rocher, C., Borsa, P., Chenuil, A., Feral, J.P., Phylogeography of the red coral (Corallium rubrum): Inferences on the evolutionary history of a temperate gorgonian (2011) Genetica, 139, pp. 855-869; Baker, A.C., Flexibility and specificity in coral-algal symbiosis: Diversity, ecology and biogeography of Symbiodinium (2003) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 34, pp. 661-689; Baker, A.C., Romanski, A.M., Multiple symbiotic partnerships are common in scleractinian corals, but not in octocorals: Comment on Goulet (2006) (2007) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 335, pp. 237-242; Baker, A.C., Rowan, R., Knowlton, N., Symbiosis ecology of two Caribbean acroporid corals (1997) Proceedings of the 8th International Coral Reef Symposium, Panama, 2, pp. 1295-1300; Baums, I.B., Johnson, M.E., Devlin-Durante, M.K., Miller, M.W., Host population genetic structure and zooxanthellae diversity of two reef-building coral species along the Florida Reef Tract and wider Caribbean (2010) Coral Reefs, 29, p. 835; Bayer, F.M., (1961) The Shallow-Water Octocorallia of the West Indian Region: A Manual for Marine Biologists, , Martinus Nijho, The Hague; Beiring, E.A., Lasker, H.R., Egg production by colonies of a gorgonian coral (2000) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 196, pp. 169-177; Bellwood, D., Hughes, T., Folke, C., Nyström, M., Confronting the coral reef crisis (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 827-833; Bickford, D., Lohman, D.J., Sodhi, N.S., Cryptic species as a window on diversity and conservation (2007) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 22, pp. 148-155; Bruno, J.F., Selig, E.R., Regional decline of coral cover in the Indo-Pacific: Timing, extent, and subregional comparisons (2007) PLoS ONE, 2, pp. e711; Coffroth, M., Santos, S., Genetic diversity of symbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium (2005) Protist, 156, pp. 19-34; Coffroth, M.A., Santos, S.R., Goulet, T.L., Early ontogenetic expression of specificity in a cnidarian-algal symbiosis (2001) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 222, pp. 85-96; Cowen, R.K., Lwiza, K.M.M., Sponagule, S., Paris, C.B., Olson, D.B., Connectivity of marine populations: Open or closed?

In this study we evaluate the impact of climate change on the fire potential in the Alps in the past and in future scenarios. The Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, which successfully distinguishes among recorded fire/no fire events, is applied to projections of Regional Climate Models (RCMs) calculated on the SRES scenario A1B. We compare two different techniques: 1) a single model run of the COSMO-CLM RCM at 18 km resolution, and 2) a combination of 25-km resolution RCMs from the ENSEMBLES project, combined with the Multimodel SuperEnsemble technique and a new probabilistic Multimodel SuperEnsemble Dressing. The single-model RCM allows for a greater coherence among the input parameters, while the Multimodel techniques permit to reduce the model biases and to downscale to a higher resolution where long term records of observations are available. The projected changes with the Multimodel in the scenario give an estimation of increasing wildfire potential in the mid XXI century. In particular the frequency of severe wildfire potential days is shown to increase dramatically. The single (independent) COSMO model gives a weaker signal and in some regions of the study area the predicted changes are opposite to the ones by the Multimodel. This is mainly due to increasing precipitation amounts simulated especially in the northern parts of the Alps. However, there are also some individual models included in the Multimodel ensemble that show a similar signal. This confirms the ambiguity of any impact study based on a single climate model due to the uncertainty of the projections of the climate models. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Future climate scenarios; Higher resolution; Individual models; Long term records; Mediterranean areas; Multi-model ensemble; Multi-model superensemble; Regional climate models; Climate change; Climate models; Deforestation; Fires; alpine environment; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; COSMO-SkyMed; future prospect; image resolution; precipitation (climatology); wildfire; Deforestation; Forest Fires; Seasonal Variation; Alps",,,,,"Böhm, U., Keuler, K., Österle, H., Kücken, M., Hauffe, D., Quality of a climate reconstruction for the CADSES region (2008) Meteorol Z, 17 (8), pp. 477-485; Cane, D., Milelli, M., Weather forecasts obtained with a Multimodel SuperEnsemble Technique in a complex orography region (2006) Meteorol Z, 15 (2), pp. 207-214; Cane, D., Milelli, M., Can a Multimodel SuperEnsemble technique be used for precipitation forecasts?

Earth observation aims to identify and characterize planetary-scale processes that occur in the Earth interior or the world's oceans, at the Earth's surface or within the global atmosphere, on the basis of weak signals that may be detected in space. This is a truly challenging task that requires the dedicated efforts of professionals and firm public support commitments. The article reveals the scope of global Earth observation, highlights the technical and managerial challenges involved in undertaking it and discusses ways of making it more effective.

They are useful for the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics and yield information about trends and rapid climate changes. Forests began to appear at ca. 14. ka BP with important regional differences in the timing and spread of tree populations. All the tree taxa occurring today (apart from anthropogenic introductions) have been found in the region since at least the end of the last glacial period. They expanded from multiple refugia located at different elevations, showing dynamics and timings that deserve further investigation. Probable climatically driven vegetation changes have been recognized at most sites; for a better understanding of this phenomenon, the chronological control of the records must be improved. A weak signal, hardly detectable, is found to correlate with the 8.2. ka BP North Atlantic event. A slow trend towards aridification began in the western and central regions of southern Europe around 8-7.5. ka BP. During the last five or six thousand years, this trend became more evident and widespread. Anthropogenic factors and climate forcing can be considered as dual causes for the degradation of much of the forests in the last few millennia and for the establishment of the present-day vegetation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The potential-energy profile was obtained by fitting the N 1s core-level spectra accounting for the probing depth of both SX-PES and HX-PES and the surface downward band bending. In this study, we found that a significant potential-energy bending as large as 1.2 ± 0.05 eV occurred from surface to the depth of ∼20 nm. Taking into account such a large downward bending, the valence band maximum (VBM) with respect to Fermi energy (EF) level in the bulk was determined to be 0.75 ± 0.05 eV. A weak signal with a peak position at 0.3 ± 0.05 eV was reproducibly observed from the VBM to EF level in the HX-PES spectrum.

HX-PES is powerful tool for revealing the intrinsic bulk electronic structure of materials with large potential-energy bending.

By combining the capabilities of tech-mining in identifying and in highlighting trends, weak signals, with those of semantic-TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadatch - Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) in identifying the functions, its causes and effects, a better understanding of the trends may be obtained in a shorter time. An interesting trend in the use of graphene in cathode materials, as well as its applications, mainly to enhance the conductivity and the discharge and recharge of the Li-air battery, has been quickly assessed as a result of the combined techniques. Another two cases, the increased presence of nanostructures in cathodes and the emergence of LIFePO4 in the lithium-ion batteries have been also analysed in a short time. The results may predict the good possibilities of the combination of these two evolving techniques. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","lithium-air battery; semantic-TRIZ; tech-mining; technology analysis","data mining; energy; prediction; research and development; technological development; trend analysis",,,,,"Adams, J., Pendlebury, D., (2011) Global research report: Materials science and technology.

To promote their claims to a safe environment, they need social mediation capable of transforming the local situation they are rallying against into an emblematic case of a more general environmental health problem.

Any debate about whether that trend may, or may not, manifest is suspended; the signal is assumed to become a reality and its possible impacts are brainstormed. The use of augmentation technology to increase human endurance has some interesting implications for the future.

The purpose of the paper is to study the design aspects of customer managed intermodal transport system development to see what makes such systems competitive. Focus is on why shippers develop such solutions; how they solve fundamental performance problems; and what characterises such shippers. Shippers engage in development and management of intermodal solutions based on perceived weak signals about future threats and opportunities. Intermodal solutions are designed to meet cost, quality, and environmental requirements. Shippers engaging in development of such solutions have large and concentrated flows. Furthermore, they have strong environmental policies, and are highly dependent on efficient transport. Finally, they are major buyers in the transport market having previous experience in using rail/intermodal.

Methods: Islets were isolated from the pancreas. After sonication and centrifugation, the proteins in the supernatant from each islet were labeled with Cy3 and applied to a lectin array. Results: Despite negligible expression of the Gal antigen on the adult pig islets (APIs), GKO-islets showed weaker signals, not only for GS-I-B4 but also for PNA, WFA, PTL-I, and GS-I-A4, than the WT islets, indicating reduced contents of α-linked GalNAc and Galβ1-3GalNAc. In comparing the islets of pigs vs. humans, human islets showed stronger signals for UEA-I, AAL, TJA-II, EEL, WFA, HPA, DBA, SBA and PTL-I, indicating that besides ABO blood type antigens, high levels of fucose and α-linked GalNAc are present. On the other hand, the high mannose form was very rich in the APIs. Conclusion: GKO reduced alpha-linked GalNAc, despite negligible expression of the Gal antigen on WT-API. On the other hand, the high-mannose form was richer in both APIs than in healthy human islets. These results provide useful information for future studies. © Springer Japan 2013.","Glycoantigen; Islets; Lectin array; Xenotransplantation","alpha galactosidase; fucose; lectin; mannose; animal experiment;

Experiences from a foresight project exploring future innovation patterns (www.innovation-futures.org) are discussed. Four specific features were applied in order to underpin the recognition of structural transformation:.Inductive foresight approach with an emphasis on capturing indications for extra-systemic change at a micro level instead of extrapolating seemingly dominant macro-trends. Visual inspiration, to mobilise tacit knowledge, support a creative spirit and an easy exchange of ideas among people with different disciplinary backgrounds. Rigorous assessment of coverage of dimensions of change, to foster the explicit consideration of possibly unrecognised/hidden structural changes. Extended openness for diversity, to avoid the exclusive interpretation of weak signals only in the context of the existing structures. The findings of the project indicate interesting changes in the nexus of innovation demand and innovation supply. A wide variety of hybrid value creation models with novel configurations of innovation actors emerged. We explain the approach and findings of the project and discuss in particular the implications for foresight methodology. We argue that all four innovative methodological features contributed in a specific way to opening up new perspectives on the future of innovation and potential structural transformation of innovation processes. © 2012.","Foresight methodology; Inductive approach; Innovation pattern; Scenarios; Structural transformation; Vision; Visualisation; Weak signals","Foresight methodology; Inductive approach; Innovation patterns; Scenarios; Structural transformation; Weak signals; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Vision; Visualization; Knowledge management; innovation; knowledge; structural change",,,,,"Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) Tech.

Yet there were actually early warning signals, but they were often ignored due to a lack of appropriate methodology. Focusing on the concept of a weak signal, this book provides methods for anticipating problems and dealing with blind spots. Along with examples of this concept, the authors provide answers to questions of feasibility, including how to recognize a weak signal, and how to exploit it.

Literature shows that weak signals can befound in the organization's environment and that they appear indifferent contexts.We use internet information to represent orga- nization 'senvironment and we select these websites that are related to a given hypothesis.In contrast to related research, a methodology is provided that uses latent semantic indexing (LSI) for the identification of weak signals.This improves existing knowledge based approaches because LSI considers the aspects of meaning and thus, it is able to identify similar textual patterns indifferent contexts.A new weak signal maximization approach is introduced that replaces the commonly used prediction modeli ngapproach in LSI. It enables to calculate the largest number of relevant weak signals represented by singular value decomposition (SVD) dimensions.A case study identifies and analyses weak signals to predict trends in the field of on-site medical oxygen production.This supports the planning of research and develop- ment (R&D) for a medical oxygen supplier.As a result, it is shown that the proposed methodology enables organizations to identify weak signals from the internet for a given hypothesis.This helps strategic plan- ners to react ahead of time. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Activities of the studied companies are strongly determined by changes in the external economic situation. The specific features of the analyzed enterprises need to be responded by early reactions to the economic changes. The appropriate identification and interpretation of weak signals can be an important element for supporting the effective functioning of enterprises, both in the economic development and in the recession. Therefore, the authors proposed the implementation of selected early warning elements in the information system supporting knowledge management in machine-building industry enterprises. The system developed within the research project is financed from public science funds of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland.","Early warning system; Knowledge management system","Construction industry; Information systems; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management information systems; Management science; Early Warning System; Economic development; Effective Functioning; Engineering enterprise; Identification and Interpretation; Knowledge management system; Machine building industry; Supporting knowledge; Information management",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issue management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Chau, P.Y.K., On the use of construct reliability in mis research: A meta-analysis (1999) Information & Management, 35, pp. 217-227; Dohn, K., Gumiński, A., Zoleński, W., Assumptions for the creation of a system for supporting knowledge management in an enterprise of mechanical engineering industry (2011) Management Information Systems in XIII Business Intelligence and Knowledge, pp. 19-27. , WULS Press Warsaw; Klausmann, W., Betriebliche frühwarnsysteme im wandel (1983) Zeitschrift für Organisation, 52, pp. 39-45; Senge, P.M., (1992) The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization, , London; Huaiyi, Z., Dongchuan, S., Xiaoping, S., A design of a crisis early warning system for core ability strategy (2002) Science of Science and Management of Science and Technology, (8); Zoleński, W., Early warning systems in the enterprise (2005) Scientific Papers of Silesian University of Technology, Pp Organization and Management, (27). , Gliwice","Dohn, K.; Silesian University of TechnologyPoland","Sassman R.Lehaney B.","","Operational Research Society","Knowledge and Information Management Conference: Sustainable Quality, KIM 2013","4 June 2013 through 5 June 2013",,108585,,0903440539,,,"English","Proc. - KIM, Knowl.

However BI constructed by integrating data from multiple sources remain restricted to strong economic signals as its systems cannot cope with the amount and diversity of data about sustainability. BI's non-engagement with weak signals about the impact of unsustainable activities is aggravated by the absence of a single uncontested definition of sustainability. Ecosystem literature advocates grappling with sustainability's characteristic uncertainty-complexity by providing stakeholders with information that fosters capacities for social learning. Here we put forward socially constructed risk-based analytical-deliberative platform that integrates weak environmental signals, thus better representing the uncertainty and complexity aspects of sustainability. An Australian case-study of irrigators is used to examine how our platform integrates weak environmental signals with BI's strong signals, and fosters capacities for social learning among decision-makers. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Business intelligence; Information management; Integrated risk; Social learning; Sustainability; Systems",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., McDonnell, E., (1990) Implanting Strategic Management, , 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, NY; Beal, R.M., Competing effectively: Environmental scanning, competitive strategy, and organisational performance in small manufacturing firms (2000) Journal of Small Business Management, 38 (1), pp. 27-47; Beck, U., Risk society (1993) Towards A New Modernity, , Trans.

In doing so the paper looks at new generations of ideas; new generations of individualism; and new generations of organisational structures and cultures. Weak signals can already be identified from a century ago indicating new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, psychology and education. These signs of what many regard as evolutionary change in human thinking run parallel with many of the exponential changes manifesting in the external world. The paper argues for a shift beyond egotistic individualism to collective individualism, laying foundations for major organisational transformation to meet the needs of uncertain futures. The paper suggests that futures studies as a field needs to be sensitive to the developmental and paradigmatic changes that have been occurring both within and across the knowledge spectrum. Finally, the World Futures Studies Federation is examined as a case study to determine whether it is, indeed, ahead of its times. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"culture; education; future prospect; individualism; philosophy; psychology; twenty first century",,,,,"Berger, G., (1964) Phénoménologie du temps et prospective, , Presses Universitaires de France, Paris; Adam, B., Groves, C., (2007) Future Matters: Action, Knowledge, Ethics, Supplements to the Study of Time, , Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands; Inayatullah, S., Gidley, J., (2000) The University in Transformation: Global Perspectives on the Futures of the University, , Bergin and Garvey, Westport, CT; Boulding, E., Image and action in peace building (1988) Journal of Social Issues, 44 (2), p. 17; Masini, E., The future of futures studies (1989) Futures, (APRIL), p. 152; Inayatullah, S., Wildman, P., (1998) Futures Studies: Methods, Emerging Issues and Civilizational Visions.

They are useful for the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics and yield information about trends and rapid climate changes. Forests began to appear at ca. 14. ka BP with important regional differences in the timing and spread of tree populations. All the tree taxa occurring today (apart from anthropogenic introductions) have been found in the region since at least the end of the last glacial period. They expanded from multiple refugia located at different elevations, showing dynamics and timings that deserve further investigation. Probable climatically driven vegetation changes have been recognized at most sites; for a better understanding of this phenomenon, the chronological control of the records must be improved. A weak signal, hardly detectable, is found to correlate with the 8.2. ka BP North Atlantic event. A slow trend towards aridification began in the western and central regions of southern Europe around 8-7.5. ka BP. During the last five or six thousand years, this trend became more evident and widespread. Anthropogenic factors and climate forcing can be considered as dual causes for the degradation of much of the forests in the last few millennia and for the establishment of the present-day vegetation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By providing the participants with fabricated exogenous strong and weak information signals, the paper is able to examine the effect of the signals on their responses. The purpose of this paper is to find evidence suggesting that gender, moral opposition, level of susceptibility to information, and information signal strength influence herding in business professionals. Design/methodology/approach-The paper adopts the Hirshleifer and Hong Teoh (2003) definition of herding as “any behavior similarity/dissimilarity brought about by the interaction of individuals."" In the controlled environment of a professional business seminar, the paper collects data on the willingness of participants to strategically default on a mortgage that is underwater by varying degrees. By providing the participants with fabricated exogenous strong and weak information signals, the paper is able to examine the effect of the signals on their responses. Findings-The major contribution is that the paper finds evidence suggesting that signal strength does indeed matter. The paper finds that a weak signal is more likely to produce herding when respondents answer questions relating their own decisions and strong signals produce more herding when respondents provide advice to others. The paper also finds that women are less likely to herd and people who report they are susceptible to information influences are more likely to herd. Not surprisingly, participants who are morally opposed to strategic default are less likely to herd in most scenarios. Originality/value-No other study of which the authors are aware looks specifically at signal strength in a financial setting or uses a sample of business professionals to examine herding of a financial nature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Herding; Information signal strength; Strategic mortgage default",,,,,,"Alevy, J.E., Haigh, M.S., List, J.A., Information cascades: Evidence from a field experiment with financial market professionals (2007) The Journal of Finance, 62 (1), pp. 151-180; Barber, B.M., Odean, T., Boys will be boys: Gender, overconfidence, and common stock investment (2001) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116 (1), pp. 261-292; Bikhchandani, S., Sharma, S., Herd behavior in financial markets (2001) IMF Staff Papers, 47 (3), pp. 279-310; Cipriani, M., Guarino, A., Herd behavior in a laboratory financial market (2005) American Economic Review, 95 (5), pp. 1427-1443; Fernández, B., Garcia-Merino, T., Mayoral, R., Santos, V., Vallelado, E., Herding, information uncertainty and investors’ cognitive profile (2011) Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 3 (1), pp. 7-33; (2011) Predicting strategic default, , FICO White Paper No. 50, San Jose, CA; Froot, K.A., Scharfstein, D.S., Stein, J.C., Herd on the street: Informational inefficiencies in a market with short-term speculation (1992) The Journal of Finance, 47 (4), pp. 1461-1484; Gneezy, U., Kapteyn, A., Potters, J., Evaluation periods and asset prices in a market experiment (2003) Journal of Finance, 58 (2), pp. 821-838; Guiso, L., Sapienza, P., Zingales, L., The determinants of attitudes towards strategic default on mortgages (2013) The Journal of Finance, 68 (4), pp. 1473-C1515; Hirshleifer, D., Hong Teoh, S., Herd behaviour and cascading in capital markets: A review and synthesis (2003) European Financial Management, 9 (1), pp. 25-66; Hirshleifer, D., Subrahmanyam, A., Titman, S., Security analysis and trading patterns when some investors receive information before others (1994) Journal of Finance, 49 (5), pp. 1665-1698; Jain, A.K., Pinson, C., The effect of order of presentation of similarity judgments on multidimensional scaling results: An empirical examination (1976) Journal of Marketing Research, 13 (4), pp. 435-439; Jegadeesh, N., Kim, W., Do analysts herd?

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the practical and theoretical knowledge about EWS by providing empirical evidence from companies located in three diff erent European countries, i.e. Croatia, Austria and Greece. We propose that companies in richer countries, as measured in terms of GDP, have a higher implementation level of EWS and are more likely to meet current state-of-the-art EWS standards while companies in the countries with a lower GDP show a lesser level of development. Moreover, we explore the reasons for not implementing EWS. For our survey we used a structured questionnaire. Contrary to our hypotheses, there are no signifi cant diff erences among the countries concerning the level of EWS implementation. However, there are some diff erences as to the kind of EWS. Overall, EWS are predominately short-term oriented and operating in all three countries.

The technique is a potent tool to deconvolve overlapping spectra of fluorophores in a specimen, to discriminate weak signals of fluorophores interfering with cellular autofluorescence and to study molecular interactions of drugs within living cells. The CSI technique measures a two-dimensional set of spectra with a three-dimensional spatial resolution from a tissue section or an intact living cell treated with a fluorescent drug and analyzes it in order to: identify and map molecular interactions of the drug; quantify accumulation, localization and retention of the drug in the specimen. Features of the CSI technique are illustrated with our data obtained in the course of development and studies of advanced agents for photodynamic and boron neutron-capture anticancer therapies. © 2012 IEEE.","anticancer; confocal; fluorescence; neutronsensitizer; photosensitizer; spectral imaging","Anti-cancer therapies; anticancer; Autofluorescence; confocal; Confocal fluorescence; Confocal spectral imaging; Drug development; ITS applications; Living cell; neutronsensitizer; Spectral imaging; Spectral imaging technique; Technique measures; Three-dimensional spatial resolutions; Tissue levels; Tissue sections; Weak signals; Curricula; Fluorescence; Fluorophores; Imaging techniques; Molecular interactions; Molecular structure; Photonics; Photosensitizers; Spectrum analysis; Tissue; Spectroscopy",,,,,"Gigli, M., Doglia, S.M., Millot, J.M., Valentini, L., Manfait, M., Quantitative study of doxorubicin in living cell nuclei by microspectrofluorometry (1988) Biochim.

This study aimed to establish an approach to treat rabbit urethral injuries using fibrin glue and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Methods: Rabbit urethral injury was performed by excising the subcutaneous tissue from the ventral aspect of the penile urethra. Thirty-six New Zealand rabbits were divided into four groups: injured without treatment (control), glue treatment (glue), glue and MSCs treatment (glue+MSCs), and without injury (normal). Animals were sacrificed and the penises were excised for analysis after treatment for 10 days (n=4) and 30 days (n=5). Results: The fibrin glue had a porous structure with cellular compatibility to MSCs. Two rabbits developed urethral fistulae in the control group, but none did in either the glue or the glue+MSCs groups at day 10 and 30. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the distance between the skin and the epithelial layer at the ventral aspect of the penis increased in the glue and glue+MSCs groups compared to the control group at day 10 and 30. The density of blood vessels in the injured area increased in the glue and glue+MSCs groups compared to the control at day 10 and 30. The average thickness of the epithelial layer in the glue+MSCs group showed the same increasing trend among the three groups at day 10 and 30. The thickness and the area of the smooth muscle that surrounds the urethral mucosa at the operative region increased compared to the thickness in the control and glue groups at day 10 and 30. Pancytokeratins (AE1/AE3) staining showed weak signals in the urethral fistulae in the control group compared with the glue and glue+MSCs groups. The transplanted MSCs have differentiated into endothelial and smooth muscle cells, contributing to the formation of blood vessels and the recovery of urethral smooth muscle. Conclusions: MSCs combined with fibrin glue showed improved neovascularization and smooth muscle formation in repairing urethral injury, resulting in effective prevention of the development of urethral fistulae. Our data indicate that fibrin glue combined with MSCs may be a feasible approach for repairing urethral injury. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"After-treatment; Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells;

In this chapter, we argue that organizations that manage unexpected events and prevent small problems from becoming large crises are engaged in important acts of positive organizing. We assume that adverse events, crises, and accidents are not inevitable; rather, they result from small problems, surprises, and lapses that shift, grow, and escalate until they are too big to handle. This chapter focuses on a set of capabilities that allows organizations to contain and repair vulnerability. Specifically, we identify a set of critical capabilities that involve attention, awareness, and action: these include capabilities for attending to, making sense of, and not explaining away discrepancies; capabilities for updating and coordinating understanding as problems unfold; and capabilities for actively managing problems through containment and resilience. We end with avenues for future research and practice. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

Weak signals are defined as imprecise and early indicators of impending important events or trends, which are considered key to formulating new potential business items. However, existing methods for discovering weak signals rely on the knowledge and expertise of experts, whose services are not widely available and tend to be costly. They may even provide different analysis results. Therefore, this paper presents a quantitative method that identifies weak signal topics by exploiting keyword-based text mining. The proposed method is illustrated using Web news articles related to solar cells. As a supportive tool for the expert-based approach, this method can be incorporated into long-term business planning processes to assist experts in identifying potential business items. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: Built upon the concept of the systemic foresight methodology, the Scan-4-Light approach involves the integrated use of horizon scanning, network analysis and evolutionary scenarios combined with expert consultations and workshops. The study identified the emerging trends, issues, weak signals and wild cards; created high-value visualisations to emphasize the results and findings; and produced narratives to increase the impact and awareness of the development issues. Findings: The Scan-4-Light project has resulted in a large number of specific outputs, providing the views of the Searchlight newsletters' contents at various levels of granularity. It has set out to show how the tools used here can be applied to illustrate the relationships among issues, and how these vary across countries and regions over time, and are linked to various stakeholders and possible solutions to problems. Research limitations/implications: Scan-4-Light demonstrates how foresight tools and techniques can be used for the analysis of complex and uncertain issues, such as development and poverty, in a systemic way. Practical implications: The Scan-4-Light approach can be applied in a number of areas for scanning and identifying emerging trends and issues, and understanding the relationships between systems and solutions. Social implications: The paper gives evidence that most of the issues, if not all, related to development are not isolated, but interlinked and interconnected. They require more holistic understanding and intervention with an effective collaboration between stakeholders. Originality/value: A demonstration of a novel scanning approach is presented in the paper. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Development; Forward planning; Horizon scanning; Network analysis; Poverty; Project evaluation; Scenarios; Searchlight",,,,,,"Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., Freeman, L.C., (2002) Ucinet VI for Windows: Software for Social Network Analysis, , Analytic Technologies, Harvard, MA; Ena, O., Mikova, N., Saritas, O., Sokolova, A., A technology trend monitoring methodology: The case of semantic technologies (2012) Technovation, , submitted for publication; Freeman, L.C., Centrality in social networks I: Conceptual clarification (1979) Social Networks, 1, pp. 215-239; Intellecap, Development initiative - rainwater harvesting (2010) Searchlight South Asia - Monthly Newsletter on Trends in Pro-poor Urban Development in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, , Intellecap, New Delhi; Miles, I., Saritas, O., The depth of the horizon: Searching, scanning and widening horizons (2012) Foresight, 14 (6), pp. 530-545; (2008) Millennium Project 2008 State of the Future, , Millennium Project, Washington, DC; (2012), www.millennium-project.org/millennium/challeng.html, available at; Nugroho, Y., Saritas, O., Incorporating network perspectives in foresight: A methodological proposal (2009) Foresight, 11 (6), pp. 530-545; Saritas, O., Systems thinking for foresight (2006), PhD thesis, Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, The University of Manchester, Manchester; Saritas, O., Systemic foresight methodology (2012) Designing and Implementing Future Oriented STI Policy - Potentials and Limits of Foresight Studies, , in Gokhberg, L., Meissner, D. and Sokolov, A.(Eds.), Springer, Berlin; Saritas, O., Miles, I., (2012) Scan-4-Light: A Horizon Scanning/Trend Monitoring Project for the Rockefeller Foundation, , Manchester Institute of Innovation Research; Saritas, O., Nugroho, Y., Mapping issues and envisaging futures: An evolutionary scenario approach (2012) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 79, pp. 509-529; Saritas, O., Smith, J., The big picture - trends, drivers, wild cards, discontinuities and weak signals (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 292-312; Saritas, O., Pace, L.M., Stalpers, S., Stakeholder participation and dialogue in foresight (2010) Exploring the Future: The Role of Interaction in Foresight, pp. 38-71. , in Borch, K., Koutsopoulos, K.

The dilemma caused by their varying definitions led Hiltunen (2008) to introduce the concept of 'future sign', which is based on Peirce's semiotic model of the sign. Hiltunen's conceptual framework is developed further in this paper. The focus of the analysis shifts from single future signs to the signification processes in which the future signs are perceived, interpreted and produced. The idea is that every future-oriented signification process is based on some issue on the agenda. It is a process of learning and acting, focused on the solving of problems related to the issue in question.","Change; CLA; Future sign; Semiotics; Signification process; Weak signal",,,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, I.H., (1982) Strategic response in turbulent environments, , Working Paper, No.82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, August; Ansoff, I.H., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice/Hall International; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Bankov, K., A Sociosemiotic Model (2008) A Sounding of Signs: Modalities and Moments in Music, Culture, and Philosophy, , Robert S.

In the meantime, the emergence of network coding has brought about great promises for multicast in communication networks where intermediate nodes are allowed to process independent incoming information flows. Little is known about network coding for unicast, however. The objective of this paper is thus to depart from multicast scenarios and shed light on several possible unicast scenarios to which network coding may be applied in a WiFi hotspot in order to obtain communication benefits such as throughput gain, fairness, and reduced protocol complexity. We identify five representative scenarios in which network coding may be used to benefit unicasting in a WiFi hotspot. Several open research issues and practical challenges related to each scenario are discussed individually. To illustrate the benefits of network coding for unicast in a WiFi hotspot, we propose and implement iCORE: The interface COoperation Repeater-aided network coding Engine. iCORE is a practical system in which multi-channel multi-radio repeaters are used to relay unicast traffic for those terminals sitting far away from an access point and suffering from weak signals at a WiFi hotspot. It is based on our last scenario which illustrates the synergy among network coding, opportunistic routing, and interface management. Utilizing idle wireless interfaces and listening to traffic opportunistically, iCORE allows packets to move across the interfaces and to be coded across flows whenever it sees more transmission opportunities. We evaluate iCORE on a four-node chain-like topology testbed implemented using IEEE 802.11b/g radios and compare it to MORE - the state-of-art intra-flow network coding implementation based on opportunistic routing. Our experimental results reveal promising gains in terms of throughput over MORE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The main method applied is critical thinking combined with a review of selected aspects of complexity theory and a general experience of applying foresight. Several new and practical implications for foresight techniques and their application are derived. Promoting variation is examined as one way to make policies more resilient in a complex system. Findings - Complexity science demonstrates that disruptive events do not need an associated trigger, as they are a normal part of a complex system. This insight implies that if we are always looking for weak signals we will certainly be caught unawares. Practical implications - The assumption that disruptive events can be managed by planning and forecasting is not a workable option. Instead, policy making needs to assume that unexpected disruptive events will happen even with the best horizon scanning system in place. Foresight techniques need to be developed to embrace emergence and to provide capabilities such as reframing to visualise systems from very different perspectives, including those considered impossible now. Originality/value - Although neither complexity theory nor the concept of reframing is new in the area of foresight, the derivation of practical implications for foresight techniques is original. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complexity; Complexity theory; Disruptive events; Emergence; Policy making; Reframing; Strategic planning; Uncertainty management; Variation",,,,,,"Axelrod, R., (1985) The Evolution of Cooperation, , Basic Books, New York, NY, reprinted ed; Axelrod, R., Cohen, M., (2001) Harnessing Complexity: Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier, , The Free Press, New York, NY; Battram, A., (2000) Navigating Complexity: The Essential Guide to Complexity Theory in Business and Management, , Spiro Press, London; Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, Volume 1: Human Science for a New Era, , Transaction Publishers, Piscataway, NJ; Bhimji, W., (2009) Guidance on the Use of Strategic Foresight Analysis for Policy Development in Government, , www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/horizon-scanning-centre/futuresinpolicyguidance.pdf, available at (accessed 6 June 2012), UK Government Office for Science, London; Byrne, D., (1998) Complexity Theory and the Social Sciences: An Introduction, , Routledge, New York, NY; Gheorghiou, L., Cassingena Harper, J., Keenan, M., Miles, I., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, pp. 3-23. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Glouberman, S., Zimmerman, B., (2002) Complicated and Complex Systems: What Would Successful Reform of Medicare Look Like?, , Commission on the Future of Healthcare in Canada, Ottawa; Goodwin, B., (1994) How the Leopard Changed Its Spots, , Phoenix, London; Inayatullah, S., Deconstructing and reconstructing the future: Predictive, cultural and critical epistemologies (1990) Futures, 22 (2), pp. 115-141; Mendonça, S., Pine Cunha, M., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 201-218; Mikulecky, C., The emergence of complexity: Science coming of age or science growing old?

Weak signals are signs anticipating or pointing to possibly emerging new issues. Weak signals can be perceived through all five human senses: they can be seen, heard, smelled, felt or even tasted. Visual weak signals are weak signals shown in a visual form. They can be represented as images: photos, paintings, drawings, video clips, etc. [2]. The method used by the Futures Window is to display weak signals in a visual form as a slide show on a large screen with the aim of encouraging people to anticipate and innovate futures. The Futures Window could be a central tool to be used in Creative Foresight Spaces (CFS). 11The idea for the concept of Creative Foresight Space originated during two research projects ""Technology Futures Forum"" and ""SOMED"" (Social media at the crossroads of physical, virtual and digital worlds), initiated by Dr. Sirkka Heinonen, and first described in the conference presentation by Toni Ahlqvist, Minna Halonen and Sirkka Heinonen ""Social Media Applications for Innovative Working Environments"" 9th International Conference of Finland Futures Research Centre and Finland Futures Academy ""Culture and Innovation - The search for Creative Power in Economics and Societies"".

The concept of CFS is offered as one way of responding to the growing demand for innovation in corporations and work organisations. The FW method was tested at VTT Technical Research Centre (http://www.vtt.fi/) in Finland in two pilots in 2006-2007. A survey was conducted to gather employee's opinions of the FW experiments. The results show that employees considered the FW positively and they confirmed that it stimulated futures thinking. The results of this study are encouraging for further developing the Futures Window as a key element of CFS.

Box 1000, 02044 VTT, Finland","This paper examines the concept of weak signals: its basic idea presented by Igor Ansoff and its later developments. We argue that recent futures studies have essentially deepened the analysis of this concept, which originally lacked an accurate definition. Placing weak signals in the general context of futures research has provided the concept with a theoretical point of attachment and linked it with other futures concepts - such as strong signals and trends. Recent studies have also increased the applicability of the concept of weak signals, specifying ways in which signals can be identified, collected and interpreted. Consequently, a number of empirical examples of the analysis of weak signals are nowadays available. In the present paper, we summarize and evaluate both theoretical contributions and managerial implications of these new approaches. While emphasizing the advancements of research, we also want to point out that Ansoff not only was a pioneer in the field, but developed many ideas that are still applicable today. We conclude our paper by suggesting directions for the further development of weak signals research. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"conceptual framework; research; signal",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Californian Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice-Hall International, London; Ansoff, H.I., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes-new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22, pp. 93-111; Coates, J.S., Boom time in forecasting (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 62, pp. 37-40; Irvine, J., Martin, B.R., (1989) Research Foresight.

This finding is consistent with the services of financial analysts becoming more valuable and in greater demand as accruals provide weaker signals about future cash flows. Further, it is accruals quality associated with innate uncertainty in the firm's operating environment that attracts analysts even after controlling for operating uncertainty associated with cash flow and stock return volatility. This suggests that low quality accruals provide an opportunity for analysts to benefit from generating private information. Consistent with analysts providing compensating information, we find that forecasts for firms with lower accruals quality contain more private information. © 2011.","Accruals quality; Analyst coverage; Information asymmetry; Operating uncertainty; Private information",,,,,,"Ahn, H., Cai, J., Hamao, Y., Ho, R.Y.K., Adverse selection, brokerage coverage, and trading activity on the tokyo stock exchange (2005) Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, pp. 1483-1508; Alford, A., Berger, P., A simultaneous equations analysis of forecast accuracy, analyst following, and trading volume (1999) Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance, 14, pp. 219-240. , Summer; Antia, M., Pantzalis, C., Security analyst incentives and quality of analyst generated information (2006) Journal of Investing, 15, pp. 50-55; Barron, O.E., Byard, D., Kile, C., Riedl, E.J., High-technology intangibles and analysts' forecasts (2002) Journal of Accounting Research, 40, pp. 289-312; Barron, O.E., Harris, D.G., Stanford, M., Evidence that investors trade on private event-period information around earnings announcements (2005) The Accounting Review, 80, pp. 403-421; Barron, O.E., Kim, O., Lim, S.C., Stevens, D.E., Using analysts' forecasts to measure properties of analysts' information environment (1998) The Accounting Review, 73, pp. 421-433; Barth, M.E., Kasznik, R., McNichols, M.F., Analyst coverage and intangible assets (2001) Journal of Accounting Research, 39, pp. 1-34; Bhattacharya, N., Desai, H., Venkataraman, K., Earnings quality and information asymmetry: evidence from trading costs.

Secondly, the move to transcend disciplinary specialisation, via inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary approaches is strengthening. Thirdly, at a higher order theoretical level, these developments are explicitly theorized in the discourses associated with postformal reasoning, integral theory and planetary consciousness. In spite of all these developments in other disciplines and knowledge fields, the institution of mass public education, with its underpinning industrial worldview, has been pretty static since its inception two hundred years ago. Finally, the paper identifies three minor, but significant, waves of evolutionary emergence in education over the last hundred years that if articulated and nurtured could strengthen the development of evolutionary pedagogies for the 21st century. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolution of consciousness; Evolutionary pedagogies; Foresight; Futures studies; Integral; Planetary; Postformal; Postformal pedagogies","education; theoretical study",,,,,"Gidley, J., Inayatullah, S., (2002) Youth Futures: Comparative Research and Transformative Visions, , Praeger, Westport, CT; Gidley, J., Bateman, D., Smith, C., (2004) Futures in Education: Principles, Practice and Potential, , Australian Foresight Institute, Melbourne; Freire, P., (1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, , Herder and Herder, New York; Illich, I., (1975) Deschooling Society, , Calder and Boyers, London; Gidley, J., Beyond homogenisation of global education: do alternative pedagogies such as Steiner education have anything to offer an emergent globalis/ing world?

Foresight has made a transition from thematic papers and policy briefs to a complex set of methods integrated in the framework of S&T and innovation policy making. Foresight also addresses broad social and economic issues along with conventional S&T problems. It focuses often on interdisciplinary fields and cross-sector problems. It has witnessed the introduction of such new methods as weak signals and wild cards, and it has benefitted from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Russian S&T foresight follows global trends. It has given support for revisions of the national S&T priorities and critical technologies. In 2007-2010, two cycles of the National S&T Foresight (initiated by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation) were completed. They resulted in the creation of frameworks and expert networks for future studies. Foresight culture has been finding deeper roots in Russia. The paper addresses mainly the key features of the third (ongoing) cycle of the national S&T Foresight (2011) against the background of the first two cycles and the international trends. This cycle represents a wider coverage of issues (macroeconomic scenarios, trends in basic research, S&T resources, future dem and for skills, and global drivers of S&T developments); more complicated methodologies (bibliometric analysis, expert panels, surveys, roadmapping, and quantitative models); and a combination of ""market pull"" and ""technology push"" approaches toward estimating future developments. This cycle is building a wider network of experts at new Foresight centres at various Russian research universities. It concludes with a discussion of some barriers still to be overcome in Foresight studies: integration of sectoral visions, deeper analyses of some scientific disciplines, stronger integration into policy making, and spreading among business and research communities.","Critical technologies; Decision-making; Foresight; Long-term forecasting; National innovation system; Roadmapping; Russian long-term S&T foresight; S&T priorities",,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Grand challenges - A new framework for foresight evaluation (2011) Paper Presented at the EU-SPRI Conference, , 20-22 September.

The required broad view of the future has also taught the companies not to just collect and analyze as much information as possible but also to give room to intuition and listen very good to external experts. Lastly, the companies more and more use their network to look for 'weak signals' in their business environment thereby attempting to make their companies much more agile so that having a very long view of the future is no longer a dominant approach. Overall, the research shows a contingency perspective towards looking at the future.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores the grey area that lays between some consolidated analytical concepts, namely: spillovers, corporate responsibility, social cooperation and non-governmental organizations. It is in this grey area that ""social multinationals"" can be placed and examined. Scattered evidence is provided to illustrate the emergence of this relatively new phenomenon. Findings: There are weak signals that the ""social multinational"" is a viable institutional innovation. The economic rationale is mainly represented by what could be defined in Smithian terms as the ""selfless component of self-interest"", combined with the ex ante and ex post advantages associated to multinationality. Institutional and technological transformations have created opportunities for the emergence of this phenomenon over the past three decades. However, there is a need for specifically designed policies to reinforce this relatively new trend in international business. Originality/value: The paper proposes a new analytical category and draws insights on its potential implications for welfare, poverty reduction and economic development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cooperatives; Multinational companies; Non-governmental organizations; Social business; Social responsibility; Spillovers",,,,,,"Aldashev, G., Verdier, T., When NGOs go global: Competition on international markets for development donations (2009) Journal of International Economics, 79 (2), pp. 198-210; Andreoni, J., Payne, A., Do government grants to private charities crowd out giving or fund-raising?

Poorly developed and chosen outcome measures can result in missing true effects of a treatment (type II error) or may capture weak signals of effects that are not clinically significant (type I errors). These errors can result in missed opportunities, wasted resources, and patient harm. The field of translational research is providing us with an ever-increasing number of biomarker targets for early-phase clinical trials. Clear verdicts on therapeutic advances will not occur without a reasoned approach to outcomes measure selection based in a sound conceptual framework. The development of methodologically sound outcome measures is a critical step but is outside of the scope of this chapter which will focus on the use of measures rather than on their development. Here we provide an overview of outcome measures in neurology clinical trials, including developing a conceptual endpoint model, role and use of biomarkers, and considerations on how to select, use and interpret them in the context of early-stage clinical trial design. Outcome measures in neurology clinical trials. The domains of outcomes used in neurology clinical trials range from biomarkers and lab correlates, signs and symptoms of disease, safety endpoints, functional scales, disability scales, survival endpoints, patient-reported outcomes, health-related quality of life measures, and economic endpoints. Each subspecialty in neurology has a growing portfolio of outcome measures [1].

One pathway, which couples the proteolytic activation of the mother cell transcription factor σ E to the action of a forespore synthesized signal molecule, SpoIIR, has remained enigmatic. Signalling by SpoIIR requires the protein to be exported to the intermembrane space between forespore and mother cell, where it will interact with and activate the integral membrane protease SpoIIGA. Here we show that SpoIIR signal activity as well as the cleavage of its N-terminal extension is strictly dependent on the prespore fatty acid biosynthetic machinery. We also report that a conserved threonine residue (T27) in SpoIIR is required for processing, suggesting that signalling of SpoIIR is dependent on fatty acid synthesis probably because of acylation of T27. In addition, SpoIIR localization in the forespore septal membrane depends on the presence of SpoIIGA. The orchestration of σ E activation in the intercellular space by an acylated signal protein provides a new paradigm to ensure local transmission of a weak signal across the bilayer to control cell-cell communication during development. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"beta galactosidase;

We study three models of agent behavior. In the fixed response model, agents use a fixed linear combination to incorporate information from their peers into their own estimate. This can be thought of as an extension of the DeGroot model to a dynamic setting. In the best response model, players calculate minimum variance linear estimators of the underlying state. We show that regardless of the initial configuration, fixed response dynamics converge to a steady state, and that the same holds for best response on the complete graph. We show that best response dynamics can, in the long term, lead to estimators with higher variance than is achievable using well chosen fixed responses. The penultimate prediction model is an elaboration of the best response model. While this model only slightly complicates the computations required of the agents, we show that in some cases it greatly increases the efficiency of learning, and on complete graphs is in fact optimal, in a strong sense. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bayesian agents; social learning; social networks","Agent behavior; Bayesian Agents; Best response; Complete graphs; Dynamic environments; Initial configuration; Linear combinations; Linear estimators; Minimum variance; Prediction model; Response model; Social learning; Social Networks; Steady state; Three models; Weak signals; Bayesian networks; Dynamics; Economics; Estimation; Internet; Mathematical models; Social networking (online); Wine; Peer to peer networks",,,,,"Aaronson, S., The complexity of agreement (2005) Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 634-643. , DOI 10.1145/1060590.1060686, STOC'05: Proceedings of the 37th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing; Acemoglu, D., Dahleh, M., Lobel, I., Ozdaglar, A., (2008) Bayesian Learning in Social Networks; Acemoglu, D., Nedic, A., Ozdaglar, A., Convergence of rule-of-thumb learning rules in social networks (2008) 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, CDC 2008, pp. 1714-1720. , IEEE; Aumann, R.J., Agreeing to disagree (1976) The Annals of Statistics, 4 (6), pp. 1236-1239; Bachelier, L., (1900) Théorie de la Spéculation, , Gauthier-Villars; Bala, V., Goyal, S., Learning from neighbours (1998) Review of Economic Studies, 65 (3), pp. 595-621; Bandiera, O., Rasul, I., Social networks and technology adoption in Northern Mozambique (2006) Economic Journal, 116 (514), pp. 869-902. , DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01115.x; Besley, T., Case, A., (1994) Diffusion as a Learning Process: Evidence from Hyv Cotton, , Working Papers; Conley, T., Udry, C., Social learning through networks: The adoption of new agricultural technologies in Ghana (2001) American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 83 (3), pp. 668-673; DeGroot, M.H., Reaching a consensus (1974) Journal of the American Statistical Association, pp. 118-121; DeMarzo, P.M., Vayanos, D., Zwiebel, J., Persuasion bias, social influence, and unidimensional opinions (2003) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118 (3), pp. 909-968. , DOI 10.1162/00335530360698469; Frongillo, R.M., Schoenebeck, G., Tamuz, O., Social learning in a changing world (2011) Tech.

They are structured by the elements of information systems (IS) design theories. Addressing the lack of a sound requirements analysis, our first finding proposes a 360- degree ESS for executives' ""managing a company"" task and presents how to select just the most important scanning areas to keep focus. Three other findings cover the IS model perspective focusing on a better ""grasp"" of weak signals: define concrete indicators and use IT to identify relevant cause-effective-chains, leverage IT to automate day-to-day routines and monitor the variety of indicators' movements, and leverage expert experience and translate indicators' impact into a balanced opportunity-and-threat portfolio. From the methods perspective on ESS, we fifth propose to incorporate scanning results into executives' decision-making process more closely by generating scenarios from a set of assumptions and the development of indicators. Retrospective controls to update the ESS continuously and collaboration to share the scanning findings in day-to-day operation is our sixth finding. Finally, an instantiation at a large international company helped us validate our findings and to highlight how current developments in IS contribute to successful design, implementation, and day-to-day operation of new-generation ESS.","Balanced chance and risk management; Business intelligence information systems (IS) design; Corporate management","Body of knowledge; Corporate management; Day-to-day operations; Decision making process; Design theory; Economic crisis; Environmental scanning; Expert experience; International company; Literature reviews; Requirements analysis; Scanning area; State of the art; Weak signals; Design; Imaging systems; Industry; Information systems; Risk management; Sustainable development; Scanning",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , 1st Edition.

The categorized offers are used in many tasks including product taxonomy browsing and matching merchant offers to products in the catalog. Hence, learning a product classifier with high precision and recall is of fundamental importance in order to provide high quality shopping experience. A product offer typically consists of a short textual description and an image depicting the product. Traditional approaches to this classification task is to learn a classifier using only the textual descriptions of the products. In this paper, we show that the use of images, a weaker signal in our setting, in conjunction with the textual descriptions, a more discriminative signal, can considerably improve the precision of the classification task, irrespective of the type of classifier being used. We present a novel classification approach, Confusion Driven Probabilistic Fusion++ (CDPF++), that is cognizant of the disparity in the discriminative power of different types of signals and hence makes use of the confusion matrix of dominant signal (text in our setting) to prudently leverage the weaker signal (image), for an improved performance. Our evaluation performed on data from a major Commerce search engine's catalog shows a 12% (absolute) improvement in precision at 100% coverage, and a 16% (absolute) improvement in recall at 90% precision compared to classifiers that only use textual description of products. In addition, CDPF++ also provides a more accurate classifier based only on the dominant signal (text) that can be used in situations in which only the dominant signal is available during application time. © 2011 IEEE.","E-commerce; Image; Product classification; Text","Classification approach; Classification tasks; Commerce search engine; Confusion matrices; High precision; High quality; Image; Product classification; Text; Textual description; Commerce; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Search engines; Text processing",,,,,"http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/08/forresterforecast-online-retail-sales- will-grow-to-250-billion-by-2014, Accessed Feb 15 2011; (2010) Global Trends in Online Shopping: A Nielsen Global Consumer Report, , http://hk.nielsen.com/documents/Q12010OnlineShoppingTrendsReport.pdf, June; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., On integrating catalogs (2001) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on World Wide Web; Blum, A., Mitchell, T., Combining labeled and unlabeled data with co-training (1998) COLT; Christoudias, C.M., Saenko, K., Morency, L.-P., Darrell, T., Co-adaptation of audio-visual speech and gesture classifiers (2006) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces; Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K.I., Winn, J., Zisserman, A., The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2010 (VOC2010) Results, , http://www.pascalnetwork.org/challenges/VOC/voc2010/workshop/index.html; Griffin, J., Holub, A., Perona, P., Caltech-256 object category dataset (2007) Technical Report 7694 California Institute of Technology; Guillaumin, M., Verbeek, J., Schmid, C., Lear, I., Kuntzmann, L., Multimodal semi-supervised learning for image classification (2010) IEEE Conference in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Hsu, C., Lin, C., A comparison of methods for multiclass support vector machines (2002) Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on, 13 (2), pp. 415-425; Kalva, P.R., Enembreck, F., Koerich, A.L., Web image classification based on the fusion of image and text classifiers (2007) International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition; Kannan, A., Givoni, I., Agrawal, R., Fuxman, A., Matching unstructured offers to structured product descriptions (2011) Proceedings of ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; Kittler, J., Hatef, M., Duin, R., Matas, J., On combining classifiers (2002) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence; Ko, A.H.R., Sabourin, R., Britto Jr., A., Oliveira, L., Pairwise fusion matrix for combining classifiers (2007) Pattern Recognition, 40; Krogel, M.-A., Scheffer, T., Multi-relational learning, text mining, and semi-supervised learning for functional genomics (2004) Machine Learning, 57, pp. 61-81; Levin, A., Viola, P., Freund, Y., Unsupervised improvement of visual detectors using cotraining (2003) IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision; Li, T., Ogihara, M., Semi-supervised learning from different information sources (2005) Knowledge Information Systems Journal, 7 (3); Li, Y., Crandall, D.J., Huttenlocher, D.P., Landmark classification in large-scale image collections (2009) International Conference on COmputer Vision; Lin, W., Hauptmann, A., News video classification using svm-based multimodal classifiers and combination strategies (2002) ACM Multimedia, Juan-les-Pins; Sarawagi, S., Chakrabarti, S., Godbole, S., Cross-training: Learning probabilistic mappings between topics (2003) Proceedings of the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; Shatkay, H., Chen, N., Blostein, D., Integrating image data into biomedical text categorization (2006) Bioinformatics, 22, pp. 446-453; Tang, F., Brennan, S., Zhao, Q., Tao, H., Co-tracking using semi-supervised support vector machines (2007) International Conference on Computer Vision; Torralba, A., Murphy, K.P., Freeman, W.T., Rubin, M., Context-based vision system for place and object recognition (2003) International Conference on Computer Vision; Wolpert, D.H., Stacked generalization (1992) Neural Networks, 5, pp. 241-259; Zhang, D., Wang, Y., Zhou, L., Yuan, H., Shen, D., Multimodal classification of alzheimers disease and mild cognitive impairment (2011) NeuroImage; Zhu, X., Goldberg, A.B., (2009) Introduction to Semi-Supervised Learning, , Morgan and Claypool","Kannan, A.; Microsoft Research Search Labs., Mountain View, United States; email: ankannan@microsoft.com",,"National Science Foundation (NSF) - Where Discoveries Begin;University of Technology Sydney;Google;Alberta Ingenuity Centre for Machine Learning;IBM Research",,"11th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM 2011","11 December 2011 through 14 December 2011","Vancouver, BC",88560,15504786,9780769544083,,,"English","Proc.

The first-minimalism- emphasizes public interventions that incorporate market concepts and practices while also centralizing and minimizing administrative discretion. The second- experimentalism-emphasizes interventions in which the central government affords broad discretion to local administrative units but measures and assesses their performance in ways designed to induce continuous learning and revision of standards. Minimalism has been prominent in legal scholarship and in the policy discourse of recent presidential administrations, but its practical impact has been surprisingly limited. By contrast, experimentalism, which has had a lower profile in academic and public discussion, has visibly influenced a broad range of critical policy initiatives in the United States and abroad. Indeed, key initiatives of the Obama Administration, including the Food Safety Modernization Act and the Race to the Top education program, are virtually unintelligible from any other perspective. We argue that, in practice, minimalism suffers from an excessive preoccupation with static efficiency norms and price signals, and from insufficient attention to learning and ""weak signals"" of risk and opportunity. Experimentalist intervention is a more promising approach in the growing realm of policy challenges characterized by uncertainty about both the definition of the relevant problems and the solutions. © 2011, Charles F.

Innovative companies are aware of weak signals coming from the periphery and of trends in their industry, and they monitor the coherence between weak signals and trends (the external perspective) and strategic direction (the internal perspective).The literature today does not provide well-framed and complete methodologies for assessing the coherence among trends, vision and products. Therefore, the authors propose a methodology called ""the methodology of future coverage"", which measures how much the strategy oriented to the future effectively covers trends and megatrends. In other words, it helps to check the contents and the coherence of the firm' vision and products and those of the trends that will have relevance for the future of the industry, and this process supplies firms with supplementary information on how to improve. The authors tested this methodology and exemplified its use via the Eurotech case study, employing longitudinal analysis. The methodology can be useful as a tool for diagnosing the coherence between trends and company strategy. Moreover, from a dynamic point of view, it can be used as a tool to check on the company's progress in following up on trends by adapting its strategy over time. Finally, the methodology can be also used as a tool for cross-comparison of the ""level of future orientation"" among companies in the same industry. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend","Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend; Industry; corporate strategy; field method; forecasting method; future prospect; innovation; strategic approach; trend analysis",,,,,"Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1994) Competing for the Future, , Harward Business School Press, Boston; Okun, A., (1981) Prices and Quantities: A Macroeconomic Analysis, , The Brooking Institution; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , The Free Press, New York; Ansoff, H.I., The emerging paradigm of strategic behaviour (1987) Strateg.

This paper discusses this development in the PPI and offers some illustrative examples to demonstrate the vital need for opening up new strategic options. To address these challenges, we launch a dynamic strategic framework for a PPI firm. This dynamic capabilities- and strategic options-based framework comprises of (i) sensing the weak signals of the operational environment, (ii) formulating them as strategic options in order to capture their upside potential, (iii) hedging against the downside risks of the options, (iv) exercising these options in often thin (i.e., imperfect) intangible knowledge assets markets, and (v) reconfiguring the existing knowledge base and capabilities to sustain competitive advantage obtained. The framework will be illustrated with strategic options possible for the PPI the main focus being on the interface between the PPI and energy industry by means of a forest biorefinery case. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic capabilities; Forest biorefinery; Pulp and paper industry; Scale economies; Scope economies; Strategic options","Dynamic capabilities; Forest biorefinery; Pulp and paper industry; Scale economies; Scope economies; Strategic options; Climate change; Competition; Industrial management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Pulp; Refining; Paper and pulp industry; Economic Analysis; Forests; Industrial Engineering; Paper Industry; Pulp Industry; Refiners; Seasonal Variation",,,,,"Ambrosini, V., Bowman, C., What are dynamic capabilities and are they a useful construct in strategic management?

We incorporate these guidelines in a six-step method and focus on how the capabilities of ""modern"" information systems (IS) enable a better ""grasp"" of weak signals and a closer incorporation of the findings into the executives' decision-making process. Applying this reworked method at a raw materials and engineering company leads to a first instantiation - the ""Corporate Radar.""

These emerging tools have revealed a tremendous potential for the advancement of knowledge in brain research and for the development of useful clinical applications. They can extract the relevant control signals directly from the brain enabling individuals with severe disabilities to communicate their intentions to other devices, like computers or various prostheses. Such microsystems are self-contained devices composed of a neural probe attached with an integrated circuit for extracting neural signals from multiple channels, and transferring the data outside the body. The greatest challenge facing development of such emerging devices into viable clinical systems involves addressing their small form factor and low-power consumption constraints, while providing superior resolution. In this paper, we survey the recent progress in the design and the implementation of multi-channel neural recording Microsystems, with particular emphasis on the design of recording and telemetry electronics. An overview of the numerous neural signal modalities is given and the existing microsystem topologies are covered. We present energy-efficient sensory circuits to retrieve weak signals from neural probes and we compare them. We cover data management and smart power scheduling approaches, and we review advances in low-power telemetry. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the remaining challenges and by highlighting the emerging trends in the field. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Brain-computer interfaces; Data management; Implantable microsystems; Inductive link; Low-power biotelemetry; Multi-channel; Neural recording; Power scheduling; Sensory circuits; Ultrawide-band","equipment design; genetic procedures; human; instrumentation; metabolism; methodology; nerve cell; review; telemetry; Biosensing Techniques; Equipment Design; Humans; Neurons; Telemetry",,,,,"Hodgkin, A.L., Huxley, A.F., A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve (1952) J.

What are the shaping forces, or sources of change and what might be their impacts, particularly where these may create entirely new challenges and opportunities? Futures experts (attendees of the FTA 2008 Conference) were invited to state their opinions on these questions by considering the trends, drivers, wilds cards, discontinuities and weak signals likely to shape the future through the Big Picture Survey. The survey was launched 6 months prior to the Conference. More than 250 responses were submitted by the Conference date. The results collected were synthesised and presented back to the attendees in a plenary presentation by the authors. The current paper aims to clarify the concepts first by suggesting definitions and discussing the distinctions between them. The paper then presents the rationales of conducting the Big Picture Survey (BPS), presents its methodology and discusses the results of the survey in a greater extent. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"survey; twenty first century; Canada; United Kingdom",,,,,"van Rij V.

Very often, it does not at first contact fit in with our conventional understanding, experience or any context we are used to. Hence, we may say that we are overwhelmed with constantly changing raw data, and strategic actors especially tend to be short of more rapid, up-to-date, valid and in-depth understanding of the transforming business landscape and social environment. Strategic intelligence is an emerging field of business consulting, which aims to undertake the task of revealing large, complex or complicated issues of transformation in a more understandable form. Pattern management, however, can be seen as one field or one approach of strategic intelligence. It is an approach that may, on one hand, be based more on empiric data and formal structures than other forms of strategic intelligence, but, on the other hand, it is a very heuristic approach to integrate quantitative data, reasoning and narratives. The main attempts of this article are, first, to show, what are in general the most commonly used ways of managing, finding, drawing, reasoning or anticipating patterns from our environment, and second, to locate how the concept of pattern can be understood in different ways. From the gathered knowledge, this article presents three main categories of reasoning patterns: empirical calculation (EC) is common especially in enterprise consulting. Theory proving with observations (TPO) is common especially in natural sciences, and real combining (RC) is common especially in qualitative research and in narrative. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Complexity; Data mining; Emergence; Pattern management; Reasoning; Sense making; Strategic intelligence; Weak signals","Complexity; Emergence; Pattern management; Reasoning; Sense making; Strategic intelligence; Weak signals; Data mining; Heuristic methods; Metadata; corporate strategy; data mining; empirical analysis; heuristics; information; management; theoretical study",,,,,"Russell, R.L., (2007) Sharpening Strategic Intelligence: Why the CIA Gets It Wrong and What Needs to Be Done to Get It Right, , Cambridge University Press; (2007) Managing Strategic Intelligence Techniques and Technologies, , Information Science Publishing, M.

The relationship between proxies and temperature is weak and the number of proxies is far larger than the number of target data points. Furthermore, the data contain complex spatial and temporal dependence structures which are not easily captured with simple models. In this paper, we assess the reliability of such reconstructions and their statistical significance against various null models. We find that the proxies do not predict temperature significantly better than random series generated independently of temperature. Furthermore, various model specifications that perform similarly at predicting temperature produce extremely different historical backcasts. Finally, the proxies seem unable to forecast the high levels of and sharp run-up in temperature in the 1990s either in-sample or from contiguous holdout blocks, thus casting doubt on their ability to predict such phenomena if in fact they occurred several hundred years ago. We propose our own reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere average annual land temperature over the last millennium, assess its reliability, and compare it to those from the climate science literature. Our model provides a similar reconstruction but has much wider standard errors, reflecting the weak signal and large uncertainty encountered in this setting. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2011.","Climate change; Cross-validation; Global warming; Model validation; Paleoclimatology; Temperature reconstruction; Time series",,,,,,"Amman, C.M., Joos, F., Otto-Bliesner, B.L., Tomas, R., Solar influence on climate during the past millennium: Results from transient simulations with the NCAR climate system model (2007) Proc.

The QTL results from crosses using the Chinese Meishan (MS) (slow growing and fat) are particularly interesting because the MS alleles have been found to be associated with increased growth rate and reduced backfat depth. We investigated these QTL further in a composite population derived previously over eight generations by intercrossing Meishan and the European Large White breeds. Genotype information from 32 markers in a 15cM target region was used in linkage and association analyses. A two-step variance component analysis identified QTL for three growth-related traits, explaining 19 ∼ 24% of the phenotypic variance with a confidence interval of 4 cM in the target region. SNP association analyses found that ss181128966 and ss181128924 within the QTL interval were strongly associated with the growth traits. Only weak signals for an effect on backfat depth were found in the association and linkage analyses, possibly because of past directional selection in the composite population. © 2010 The Authors, Animal Genetics © 2010 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.","association; growth rate; identity-by-descent; pig; quantitative trait loci; subcutaneous fat depth; variance component analysis","adipose tissue; animal; article; breeding; genetics; growth, development and aging; major histocompatibility complex; meat; quantitative trait; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; swine; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Breeding; Major Histocompatibility Complex; Meat; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Sus scrofa; Pieris brassicae; Suidae; Sus",,,,,"Aulchenko, Y.S., De Koning, D.J., Haley, C.S., Genomewide rapid association using mixed model and regression: A fast and simple (2007) Genetics, 177, pp. 577-585; Bidanel, J.P., Milan, D., Iannuccell, N., Detection of quantitative trait loci for growth and fatness in pigs (2001) Genetics Selection Evolution, 33, pp. 289-309; Demars, J., Riquet, J., Feve, K., Gautier, M., Morisson, M., Demeure, O., Renard, C., Milan, D., High resolution physical map of porcine chromosome 7 QTL region and comparative mapping of this region among vertebrate genomes (2006) BMC Genomics, 7, p. 13; Demeure, O., Sanchez, M.P., Riquet, J., Exclusion of the swine leukocyte antigens as candidate region and reduction of the position interval for the Sus scrofa chromosome 7 QTL affecting growth and fatness (2005) Journal of Animal Science, 83, pp. 1979-1987; George, A.W., Visscher, P.M., Haley, C.S., Mapping quantitative trait loci in complex pedigrees: A two-step variance component approach (2000) Genetics, 156, pp. 2081-2092; Gilmour, A.R., Gogel, B.J., Cullis, B.R., Welham, S.J., Thompson, R., (2002) ASReml User Guide Release 1.0, , NSW Agriculture, Orange, Australia; Green, P., Falls, K., Crooks, S., (1990) Cri-Map, Version 2.4, , Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, USA; Guo, Y.M., Lee, G.J., Archibald, A.L., Haley, C.S., Quantitative trait loci for production traits in pigs: A combined analysis of two Meishan × Large White populations (2008) Animal Genetics, 39, pp. 486-495; Humphray, S.J., Scott, C.E., Clark, R., A high utility integrated map of the pig genome (2007) Genome Biology, 8, pp. R139; De Koning, D.J., Rattink, A.P., Harlizius, B., Van Arendonk, J.A., Brascamp, E.W., Groenen, M.A., Genome-wide scan for body composition in pigs reveals important role of imprinting (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 97, pp. 7947-7950; De Koning, D.J., Rattink, A.P., Harlizius, B., Groenen, M.A.M., Brascamp, E.W., Van Arendonk, J.A.M., Detection and characterization of quantitative trait loci for growth and reproduction traits in pigs (2001) Livestock Production Science, 72 (3), pp. 185-198. , DOI 10.1016/S0301-6226(01)00226-3, PII S0301622601002263; Lander, E.S., Botstein, D., Mapping Mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits using RFLP linkage maps (1989) Genetics, 121, pp. 185-199; Tanaka, M., Suzuki, K., Morozumi, T., Kobayashi, E., Matsumoto, T., Domukai, M., Eguchi-Ogawa, T., Uenishi, H., Genomic structure and gene order of swine chromosome 7q1.1 → q1.2 (2006) Animal Genetics, 37, pp. 10-16; Wada, Y., Akita, T., Awata, T., Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in a Meishan × Gottingen cross population (2000) Animal Genetics, 31, pp. 376-384; Wei, W.H., De Koning, D.J., Penman, J.C., Finlayson, H.A., Archibald, A.L., Haley, C.S., QTLs modulating ear size and aspect in pigs (2007) Animal Genetics, 38, pp. 222-226","Haley, C.

These are Corexit 9500 (the current product being used), DISPERSIT SPC 1000, JD 2000, Nokomis 3-F4, Nokomis 3-AA, SAF-RON GOLD, Sea Brat #4, and ZI-400. To address this request, ORD staff and outside collaborators carried out a number of separate studies that were run using in vitro (cell-based) assays. A total of 8 cytotoxicity assays, 3 AR agonist assays, 1 AR antagonist assay and 4 ER agonist assays were run on the 8 dispersants, plus reference compounds. Tests were run across a wide range of dispersant concentrations (0.001 to 10,000 parts per million, or ppm). Two dispersants showed a weak signal in one of the four ER assays, but integrating over all of the ER and AR results these data do not indicate that any of the eight dispersants display biologically significant endocrine activity via the androgen or estrogen signaling pathways. All of the dispersants showed cytotoxicity in at least one cell type at concentrations between 10 and 1000 ppm. Both JD 2000 and SAF-RON GOLD tend to be less cytotoxic than the other dispersants. Likewise, DISPERSIT SPC 1000 tends to be more cytotoxic than the other dispersants in the cell-based assays. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,,,,,"Jobling, S., Sheahan, D., Osborne, J.A., Matthiessen, P., Sumpter, J.P., Inhibition of testicular growth in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to estrogenic alkylphenolic chemicals.

Observations of physical, bio-optical properties (including bioluminescence) together with results from dynamical biochemical and bioluminescence models are used to interpret the development of the upwelling event during August 2003 in Monterey Bay, California. Observations and the biochemical model show the development of a phytoplankton bloom in the southern portion of Monterey Bay. Model results show an increase of nutrients in the southern portion of the bay, where nutrient-rich water masses are brought in by the southward flow and cyclonic circulation inside the bay. This increase in nutrients together with the sluggish circulation in the southern portion of the bay provides favorable conditions for phytoplankton growth. Our observations and models suggest that with the development of upwelling the offshore water masses with the subsurface layer of bioluminescent zooplankton were replaced by water masses advected from the northern coast of the bay with a relatively high presence of mostly nonbioluminescent phytoplankton. Inshore observations from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) show consistent coincidence of chlorophyll, backscatter, and bioluminescence maxima during upwelling development. Offshore AUV observations (taken at the entrance to the bay) show a deeper bioluminescence maximum below the surface layers of high chlorophyll and backscatter values during the earlier stages of upwelling development. Later, the observed deep offshore bioluminescence maximum disappeared and became a shallower and much weaker signal, coinciding with high chlorophyll and backscatter values offshore. Based on the biochemical and bioluminescence models, a methodology for estimating the nighttime water-leaving radiance due to stimulated bioluminescence is demonstrated and evaluated.

For example, graphene is regarded as a promising candidate for future devices, and the electronic properties of nanodevices constructed from this material are in large part governed by the edge structures1. The atomic configurations at graphene boundaries have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy2-4, but the electronic properties of these edge states have not yet been determined with atomic resolution. Whereas simple elemental analysis at the level of single atoms can now be achieved by means of annular dark field imaging5 or electron energy-loss spectroscopy6,7, obtaining fine-structure spectroscopic information about individual light atoms such as those of carbon has been hampered by a combination of extremely weak signals and specimen damage by the electron beam. Here we overcome these difficulties to demonstrate sitespecific single-atomspectroscopy at a graphene boundary, enabling direct investigation of the electronic and bonding structures of the edge atoms-in particular, discrimination of single-, double- and triple-coordinated carbon atoms is achieved with atomic resolution. By demonstrating how rich chemical information can be obtained fromsingle atomsthrough energy-loss near-edge fine-structure analysis8, our results should open the way to exploring the local electronic structures of various nanodevices and individual molecules. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"carbon; graphene; atomic absorption spectroscopy; graphite; molecular analysis; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; article; atom by atom spectroscopy; electron; electron energy loss spectroscopy; nanodevice; priority journal; scanning transmission electron microscopy; spectroscopy; transmission electron microscopy",,"carbon, 7440-44-0",,,"Kobayashi, Y., Fukui, K., Enoki, T., Kusakabe, K., Edge state on hydrogenterminated graphite edges investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (2006) Phys.

Transformational changes might only occur, in many instances, over time frames that extend well beyond those of mainstream approaches to planning. The need for more explicit attention to longer term futures is reflected in the increasing use of scenario-based processes applied to sustainability challenges. The full potential of scenario development remains, however, largely untapped; many audiences have yet to be engaged, intrigued and influenced by them. This review article explores key barriers to more effective use of scenario development in relation to sustainability challenges, including: (1) the persistent predictive orientation of sustainability planning exercises; (2) the relatively low level of interest in weak signals and their implications; (3) institutionalized aversion to long term planning; and (4) the predominance of an essentialist perspective. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Essentialism; Scenario building in support of sustainability strategy (SBSS); Scenario development; Scenarios; Weak signals",,,,,,"Carlsson-Kanyama, A., Dreborg, K.H., Moll, H.C., Padovan, D., Participative backcasting: A tool for involving stakeholders in local sustainability planning (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 34-46; Peterson, G.D., Cumming, G.S., Carpenter, S.R., Scenario planning: A tool for conservation in an uncertain world (2002) Conserv.

First the mentality of reviving the shining past as well as paying attention to the GDP growth rate in the race of the East to take over the position of leaders from the West is reviewed. An association is made between a memorable metaphor and the scenario of reviving the shining past. Then some guidelines are introduced and applied to the far ahead futures of Asia including a) violating old implicit assumptions by applying what if mechanism, b) identifying and articulating distinct value systems, and c) detecting weak signals that may hint to the next mainstream. Four scenarios are built within the rationale of transformation scenario. The aim is to do exotic futures studies and to create alternative images. Such images not only may help shift the identity of future Asians but also influence today decisions and actions of both Asians and non Asians.","Asia; East; Life technology; Space technology; Transformation scenarios; Value systems; West",,,,,,"Al-Wardi, A.H.M., (2010) The logic of Ibn Khaldun: In light of his civilization and personality (in Arabic), , Beirut, Lebanon: Dar wa Maktaba Dijlah wa Al Furat; Anton, P.S., Silberglitt, R., Schneider, J., (2001) The global technology revolution: Bio/nano/materials trends and their synergies with information technology by 2015, , http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/MR1307.pdf, Santa Monica, CA: RAND.

Weak signals are identified from the early 20th century indicating the emergence of new knowledge patterns. These signals have strengthened in the last 40 years. The paper first identifies new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, religion and education. New knowledge patterns are then identified in discourses that traverse disciplinary boundaries through transdisciplinary approaches such as futures studies and planetary/global studies. The paper then discusses evolution of consciousness, identifying research that theorises new ways of thinking as being related to individual psychological development and/or socio-cultural evolution. Finally, evolutionary concepts are discussed that attempt to meta-cohere the new knowledge patterns via the terms postformal, integral and planetary. Notably, academic research on "" futures of thinking,"" "" evolution of consciousness"" and/or "" global mindset change"" has been, until now, largely ignored by mainstream academic discourse on evolution, consciousness and futures studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Adult developmental psychology; Evolution of consciousness; Futures; Integral; Macrohistory; Planetary; Postformal; Transdisciplinarity","academic research; evolution; future prospect; interdisciplinary approach; philosophy; psychology",,,,,"Miller, R., Making connections to the world: some thoughts on holistic curriculum [Electronic version] (2006) Encounter: Education for Meaning and Social Justice, 19 (3); Naisbitt, J., (2006) Mindset: Eleven Ways to Change the Way You See - and Create - The Future, , Collins Business, Harper Collins, New York, NY; László, E., (2006) The Chaos Point: The World at the Crossroads, , Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc., Charlottsville, VA; Gidley, J., An other view of integral futures: de/reconstructing the IF brand (2010) Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning and Futures Studies, 42 (2), pp. 125-133; Hampson, G., Integral futures and futures of integral: an analysis of Richard Slaughter's analysis of Causal Layered Analysis (2010) Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning and Futures Studies, 42 (2), pp. 134-148; Slaughter, R., Introduction: Integral futures methodologies (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 101-108; Hayward, P., Pathways to integral perspectives (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 109-119; Gidley, J., The evolution of consciousness as a planetary imperative: an integration of integral views (2007) Integral Review: A Transdisciplinary and Transcultural Journal for New Thought, Research and Praxis, 5, pp. 4-226; Commons, M.L., Richards, F.A., Organizing components into combination: how stage transition works (2002) Journal of Adult Development, 9 (3), pp. 159-177; Einstein, A., Relativity: The Special and General Theory (Translated Robert W.

The assumed results will form the informational basis for the development of the cosmogony of planets' small satellites and asteroids. Correspondingly, the aims of the experiment are to study the internal structure and energy state of Phobos; to analyze the manifestation of pulsed effects and fields, including the registration of seismic signals and wave fields of Phobos; and to measure the long-period oscillations on the surface of Phobos in the range of 10-5-10 Hz. Studying Phobos gives an example of specific problems peculiar to small bodies of the Solar System: specific features of cratering, grooves, and morphological structures. The registration of gas-dust streams extends the knowledge of the space-time structure of the Solar System and its objects and processes and will confirm that stellar systems can constantly interact. The physical principles of the registration of seismic fields and signals are briefly described, and the instrumental basis for cosmogonic seismology is comparatively presented. It has been indicated that the piezoelectric and electrodynamic systems of the desired signal registration complete each other, and it is desirable to use both systems if 2- and 3-D registration systems are applied. The seismometric instrumentation of the Phobos spacecraft has been considered. The device's physical characteristics, block diagrams, energy consumption, and information content are presented. The seismoacoustic (HF) device unit and its advantages during the registration of very weak signals owing to the use of the mechanical transformer effect are described in more detail. The seismic system created can ensure the solution of the scientific problems of the mission to Phobos, including the study of the internal structure, origin, depth structures, and external impacts of the field, corpuscular, and micrometeorite types. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,"Bazilevskii, A.T., Problems of Geologic-Geophysical Research of the Phobos and the Ways for Their Solving in the Frames of ""Fobos"" Project.

It is located on chromosome 15q13-q14, which is one of the replicated linkage spots for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Methods: We conducted an association study to determine whether previous positive association is replicable in the Korean population. We included 254 patients with schizophrenia, 193 patients with bipolar disorder type 1,38 patients with bipolar disorder type II, 64 schizoaffective disorder patients, and 349 controls. All subjects were ethnically Korean. A total of 898 subjects were included, and genotyping was done for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CHRNA7. These three intronic SNPs were rs2337506 (AJG), rs6494223 (C/T), and rsl2916879 (A/G). Results: There was only one marginally significant association; this association was between rs12916879 and bipolar disorder type I in the male subgroup. In both the allele and genotype distributions, we found a weak signal (Chi-squared=3.57, df=1, p=0.06 for allele, Chi-squared=7.50, df=2, p=0.02 for genotype) only. Unphased haplotype analysis could not provide additional support for this finding. No SNP was associated with schizophrenia or any other affected groups in this Korean sample. The associative finding is marginal and inconclusive. Conclusion: We could not replicate positive association in other ethnic groups previously studied. This suggests possible heterogeneity in the genes associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Because of structural complexity of the CHRNA7 gene and the limited statistical power of this study, further genetic studies with more SNPs and larger samples covering various populations, along with more fine molecular exploration of the CHRNA7 gene structure, are required.

To study the development of layer properties during epitaxy, the total film thickness is varied between 0.2 and 1.7 μm. A surface roughening is observed caused by the increased size of hillock-like features. Additionally, small steps which are perfectly aligned in (1 1 -2 0) planes appear for samples with a thickness of ∼0.5 μm and above. Simultaneously, the X-ray rocking curve (XRC) full width at half maximum (FWHM) values become strongly dependent on incident X-ray beam direction beyond this critical thickness. Anisotropic in-plane compressive strain is initially present and gradually relaxes mainly in the [1 1 -2 0] direction when growing thicker films. Low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra are dominated by the GaN near-band-edge peak and show only weak signal related to basal plane stacking faults (BSF). The measured background electron concentration is reduced from ∼10 20 to ∼10 19 cm -3 for film thicknesses of 0.2 μm and ∼1 μm while the electron mobilities rise from ∼20 to ∼130 cm 2 /V s. The mobilities are significantly higher in [0 0 0 1] direction which we explain by the presence of extended planar defects in the prismatic plane. Such defects are assumed to be also the cause for the observed surface steps and anisotropic XRC broadening. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","A1. Defects; A1. X-ray diffraction; A3.

Although trends are considered to be important drivers of environmental discontinuities which may lead to strategic surprises, there is no operationalization from a strategic point of view. In this paper we are going to conceptualize trends as (socio-cultural) innovations. This leads to important implications. If the nature of innovation is taken seriously, then strategic trend diagnosis has to deal with two different aspects, invention and diffusion. First, we are going to present a framework for identifying the invention aspect of a trend (i.e., "" the new"" ) which is based on the fact that "" the new"" results from a transgression of contextual boundaries. Second, we are going to operationalize the diffusion of "" the new"" as a threefold process of normalization - i.e., an unusual practice becomes social convention. Taken together, these two aspects provide a theoretical link between trends and market creation. In addition, by relating the above operationalizations to an entrepreneurial strategy-making framework, strategic issue diagnosis can be improved and more seamlessly linked to strategy formulation. © 2009.",,"conceptual framework; entrepreneur; future prospect; innovation; market development; organizational framework; planning theory; strategic approach; technology diffusion; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , The Macmillian Company, New York; Keegan, W.J., (1967), Scanning the International Business Environment, Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, Boston; Bright, J.R., Evaluating signals of technological change (1970) Harvard Business Review, 48, pp. 62-70; Bright, J.R., Forecasting by monitoring signals of technological change (1973) A Guide to Practical Technological Forecasting, pp. 238-256. , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, J.R.

Yet due to their inherent flexibility, open-market repurchase programs have long been criticized as weak signals lacking commitment. We evaluate whether some managers potentially use buyback announcements to mislead investors. We focus on cases where managers were seemingly under heavy pressure to boost stock prices and might have announced a repurchase only to convey a false signal. For suspect cases, the immediate market reaction to a buyback announcement does not differ from that generally observed. However over longer horizons, suspect firms do not enjoy the improvement in economic performance otherwise observed. Suspect firms repurchase less stock. Further, managers in suspect firms have comparatively higher exposure to stock options, a potentially endogenous result suggesting greater sensitivity to both stock valuation and to future equity dilution. Overall, the results suggest only a limited number of managers may have used buybacks in a misleading way as ""cheap talk.""

In addition, Wi-Fi is not only growing in terms of numbers, but is also becoming pervasive in many respects. We are not concerned so much with the remarkable features and development patterns of Wi-Fi, however, as with the open-ended questions that Wi-Fi still raises and the uncertainties and complexities it carries with it. In this chapter, we envisage the possible futures of Wi-Fi. In the second section, we acknowledge the historical build-up and successful characteristics of Wi-Fi. In this evolution we include quantitative and qualitative evidence, as well as a few material narratives that are strongly supportive of current Wi-Fi developments. In this context, we consider what to make of the various forecasts, and how to establish the kind of knowledge perspective that users and decision makers can work with, and therefore what kind of methodological pathways may help us reach our goal. In the third section, we discuss the question of whether the future of Wi-Fi can somehow be ‘guessed’ from existing innovation models, or how to use such models in an open and helpful manner. In the fourth section, we explore the Wi-Fi journey that still lies ahead of us, in terms of options, contexts and conditions, in particular through a micro-Delphi study – i.e. a specific enquiry among experts. We present the rough output of this exploratory study in the form of potential scenarios. In the fifth and concluding section, we examine what might be some weak signals of change or, on the contrary, might be reinforcements of trends that provide early indications as to the Wi-Fi to come in the next ten years or so. We argue that one of the aspects that will be a deciding factor between the various options is the dynamic tension between innovation and regulation. © Wolter Lemstra, Vic Hayes and John Groenewegen 2011.",,,,,,,"Bass, F.M., The adoption of a marketing model: Comments and observations (1986) Innovation Diffusion Models of New Product Acceptance, pp. 203-232. , V.

Drawing from actor-network theory, non-human entities may ""translate"" new, unexpected stakeholders to support their aims. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a theoretical conceptual approach with three illustrative examples. Findings: The examples provided show that corporate crises result partly from previously unacknowledged non-human spheres of influence and cause corporations serious losses. Corporations that take a proactive stance and monitor the weak signals of change are able to improve their standing and maintain legitimacy. Research limitations/implications: The framework created requires more testing with different examples across contexts and cultures. Future studies should examine the process of translation more deeply and examine who can potentially be translated into a stakeholder. Practical implications: Corporate communication should play ""the devil's advocate"" on issues and analyze not only stakeholders, but also non-human entities that may be able to translate others into joining their cause. Originality/value: This paper broadens stakeholder theory to better describe the current corporate environment by highlighting the process of translation among stakeholders and non-human entities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Networking; Stakeholder analysis; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Ackerman, R.W., (1975) The Social Challenge to Business, , HBS Press, Cambridge, MA; Bornsen, S., Ostrom-Blonigen, J., Plowman, K., Stakeholder theory: Antidote to a drug company's market health?

The first stage of this process is positive selection, a quality-control mechanism which ensures that the T cell receptors (TCR) presented on developing thymocytes can transmit signals via peptides presented on either MHC class I (MHC1) or MHC class II (MHC2) molecules. Work over the past decade has revealed that the peptides that drive positive selection of both CD4 and CD8 lineage cells deliver only weak TCR signals. In line with these observations, specialized protein degradation machineries have been discovered in the thymic cortex that presumably generate specialized low-affinity peptide repertoires for presentation on MHC1 and MHC2 molecules. TCR signals transduced through these weak-affinity ligands in the early stages of positive selection alter the kinetics of expression of CD4 and CD8 molecules and play a crucial role in commitment of thymocytes to either the CD4 or CD8 lineages. In this work, we review the experiments that explore the peptide repertoires that are presented to developing thymocytes during positive selection, the observed signaling patterns that lead to CD4 versus CD8 lineage commitment, and speculate about how specialized organization of the signaling machinery in DP thymocytes may allow for efficient transduction of weak signals during the course of positive selection. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.","CD4; CD8; Microcluster; Peptides; Selection; Signaling; TCR","major histocompatibility antigen class 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; peptide; T lymphocyte receptor; antigen expression; article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell interaction; cell lineage; cell maturation; cell selection; protein degradation; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; thymocyte",,,,,"Nitta, T., Murata, S., Ueno, T., Tanaka, K., Takahama, Y., Thymic microenvironments for T-cell repertoire formation (2008) Adv Immunol, 99, pp. 59-94; Bevan, M.J., In thymic selection, peptide diversity gives and takes away (1997) Immunity, 7, pp. 175-178; Allen, P.M., Peptides in positive and negative selection: A delicate balance (1994) Cell, 76, pp. 593-596; von Boehmer, H., Positive selection of lymphocytes (1994) Cell, 76, pp. 219-228; Ashton-Rickardt, P.G., Tonegawa, S., A differentialavidity model for T-cell selection (1994) Immunol Today, 15, pp. 362-366; Mathis, D., Benoist, C., (2009) Aire.

Functionality of CcHyPRP has been validated for abiotic stress tolerance using the heterologous yeast and Arabidopsis systems. The CcHyPRP contained a repetitive proline-rich (PR) N-terminal domain and a conserved eight cysteine motif (8CM) at the C-terminus. Southern analysis disclosed single-copy nature of CcHyPRP gene in the pigeonpea genome. Northern analysis revealed higher levels of CcHyPRP transcripts in PEG, NaCl, heat (42°C), cold and ABA-treated plants compared with the weak signals observed in the untreated plants, suggesting stress-responsive nature of the CcHyPRP gene. In yeast, expression of CcHyPRP imparted marked tolerance against abiotic stresses exerted by PEG, high temperature, NaCl and LiCl. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines, expressing CcHyPRP under the control of CaMV35S and rd29A promoters, when subjected to PEG, mannitol, NaCl, LiCl and heat (42 °C) stress, developed into healthy plants with profuse root system and increased biomass in contrast to the weak-stunted wild-type plants. The CcHyPRP-transgenics driven by stress-inducible rd29A exhibited similar stress-tolerance as that of CaMV35S-lines without any negative effects on plant morphology, implying that stress-inducible promoters are preferable for production of stress tolerant transgenics. The overall results amply demonstrate the profound effect of CcHyPRP in bestowing multiple abiotic stress tolerance at cellular and whole plant levels. Accordingly, the multipotent CcHyPRP seems promising as a prime candidate gene to fortify crop plants with abiotic stress tolerance. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cajanus cajan hybrid-proline-rich protein; Eight-cysteine-motif; Multiple abiotic stress tolerance; PCR-subtracted cDNA library; Plant biomass; Stress-inducible CcHyPRP gene","hybrid proline rich protein, plant; hybrid proline-rich protein, plant; plant DNA; sodium chloride; vegetable protein; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; gene expression regulation; gene library; genetics; growth, development and aging; heat; metabolism; molecular genetics; osmotic pressure; physiological stress; pigeonpea; plant root; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; transgenic plant; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Cajanus; DNA, Plant; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Library; Hot Temperature; Molecular Sequence Data; Osmotic Pressure; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plants, Genetically Modified; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Sodium Chloride; Stress, Physiological; Arabidopsis; Cajanus cajan",,"sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; DNA, Plant; Plant Proteins; Sodium Chloride, 7647-14-5; hybrid proline-rich protein, plant, 147337-58-4",,,"Bartels, D., Ramanjulu, S., Drought and salt tolerance in plants (2005) Crit.

This paper discusses this development in the forest industry and offers some illustrative examples to demonstrate the vital need for opening up new strategic options. To address these challenges, we launch a dynamic strategic framework for a forest firm. This dynamic capabilities- and strategic options- based framework comprises of (i) sensing the weak signals of the operational environment, (ii) formulating them as strategic options in order to capture their upside potential, (iii) hedging against the downside risks of the options, (iv) exercising these options often related to imperfect intangible knowledge assets markets, and (v) reconfiguring the existing knowledge base and capabilities to sustain competitive advantage obtained. The framework is illustrated with strategic options possible for the forest industry the main focus being on the interface between the forest and energy industries by means of a forest biorefinery case.",,"Biorefineries; Business opportunities; Competitive advantage; Downside risks; Dynamic capabilities; Energy industry; Forest industry; Global climate changes; Illustrative examples; Knowledge assets; Knowledge base; Operational environments; Strategic frameworks; Strategic options; Weak signals; Competition; Innovation; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Climate change",,,,,"Autio, E., Dietrichs, E., Führer, K., Smith, K., Innovation Activities in Pulp, Paper and Paper Products in Europe, , Rep. 04/1997 to European Commission, Oslo, Norway: Norwegian Institute for Studies in Innovation, Research and Education (NIFU), Studies in technology, innovation and economic policy (STEP group); Christensen, L.R., Caves, R.E., Cheap talk and investment rivalry in the pulp and paper industry (1997) The Journal of Industrial Economics, 45 (1), pp. 47-60; Perks, H., Jeffery, R., Global network configuration for innovation: A study of international fibre innovation (2006) R and D Management, 36 (1), pp. 67-83. , DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9310.2005.00416.x; Pesendorf, M., Horizontal mergers in the paper industry (2003) RAND Journal of Economics, 34 (3), pp. 495-515; Stanturf, J.A., Kellison, R.C., Broerman, F.S., Jones, S.B., Innovation and Forest Industry: Domesticating the Pine Forests of the Southern United States, 1920-1999 (2003) Forest Policy and Economics, 5 (4), pp. 407-419; Toivanen, H., (2004) Learning and Corporate Strategy: The Dynamic Evolution of the North American Pulp and Paper Industry, 1860-1960, , Doctoral dissertation Georgia Institute of Technology, School of History, Technology and Society; Toland, J., Hard times in Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm (2007) Pulp and Paper International, 49 (12), p. 5; Sorenson, D., Reed, J., Patterson, D., Investors Focus on Opportunities in Cellulosic Ethanol Production (2007) Pulp & Paper, 81 (5), pp. 36-38; Dorian, J.P., Franssen, H.T., Simbeck, D.R., Global challenges in energy (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (15), pp. 1984-1991; McCormick, K., Kaberger, T., Key barriers for bioenergy in Europe: Economic conditions, know-how and institutional capacity, and supply chain co-ordination (2007) Biomass and Bioenergy, 31 (7), pp. 443-452. , DOI 10.1016/j.biombioe.2007.01.008, PII S0961953407000311; Soliño, M., Prada, A., Vázquez, M.X., Green electricity externalities: Forest biomass in an Atlantic European Region (2009) Biomass and Bioenergy, 33 (3), pp. 407-414; Ericsson, K., Huttunen, S., Nilsson, L.J., Svenningsson, P., Bioenergy policy and market development in Finland and Sweden (2004) Energy Policy, 32 (15), pp. 1707-1721. , DOI 10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00161-7, PII S0301421503001617; Van Heiningen, A., (2007) A Concept and Analysis for Converting a Kraft Mill into a Forest Biorefinery, , Presentation Finnish Paper Research Community Serving Europe, Helsinki, Finland; Rodden, G., Actions catching up to words (2008) Pulp & Paper International, 50 (6), pp. 33-37; Thorp, B., Biorefinery offers industry leaders business model for major change (2005) Pulp and Paper, 79 (11), pp. 35-39; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage - Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , New York: The Free Press; Barney, J., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Peteraf, M.A., The cornerstones of competitive advantage: A resource-based view (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (3), pp. 179-191; Teece, D.J., Pisano, G., Shuen, A., Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management (1997) Strategic Management Journal, 18 (7), pp. 509-533; Eisenhardt, K.M., Martin, J.A., Dynamic capabilities: What are they?

Traditionally, it has been discussed in respect to telecommunications, information technologies and electronics. Subjects of this convergence often change what and where customers buy, with Apple's renowned iPhone being one current example for customers' tendency towards products with multiple benefits. More recently also the chemical and its related industries find themselves affected by a larger convergence process. Concentrating on developments at the outposts of the chemical industry, we discuss indications of convergence with an example from the area of Nutraceuticals and Cosmeceuticals. Furthermore, we present and discuss a multiple indicator concept for monitoring convergence in an R&D-intensive field on the basis of publicly available data. We analyze 7, 455 scientific and patent references on phytosterols with the aid of SciFinder Scholar and 3, 836 documents employing STN AnaVist. Our results show clear indications for convergence and a proof of principle for our monitoring concept. A closer look at convergence and effective tools for spotting weak signals appears to be necessary. Particularly for practitioners, the opportunity to get a head start on their current and future competitors is of high strategic importance. © 2009 PICMET.",,"Convergence process; Cosmeceuticals; Effective tool; Nutraceuticals; Proof of principles; Scientific discipline; Weak signals; Chemical industry; Competition; Customer satisfaction; Technology",,,,,"Agrawal, A., Henderson, R., Putting patents in context: Exploring knowledge transfer from MIT (2002) Management Science, 48, pp. 44-60. , Jan; Bainbridge, W.S., Transformative Concepts in Scientific Convergence (2006) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1093, pp. 24-45; Bierly, P., Chakrabarti, A.K., Managing through industry fusion (1999) The dynamics of innovation: Strategic and managerial implications, pp. 7-26. , K.

When the SAQs under debate run against the students' systems of value, it seems that the closer the connection between the SAQs (socially acute questions) and the territorial and cultural identity, the more deeply the associated systems of values are affected; and the more the evidence is denied, the weaker the socio-scientific reasoning becomes. This result shows the importance of attempting to get the students to clarify the values underlying their socio-scientific reasoning. As Sadler observed, there was no transfer of socio-scientific reasoning on the three questions considered; each SAQ, as they are deeply related to social representations and identity, generated a specific line of reasoning balancing more or less each operation. Among various methods of teaching SAQs-problematizing, genetic, doctrinal and praxeological methods-socio-scientific reasoning may be a complex activity of problematization fostering the development of critical thinking. Confronted with the refusal to analyse the evidence in the case of the bear, and because of the nature of SAQs, we explore the notion of tangible proof. We think it relevant to study, together with the students, the processes of investigation used by the actors to establish or disestablish tangible proof on SAQs by analysing the intermediary states of the systems of proof, and possibly the ""weak signals"" which result in calling for the implementation of the precautionary principle. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Identity; Social representation; Socially acute questions; Socio-scientific issues; Socio-scientific reasoning",,,,,,"Astolfi, J.-P., Les representations: Un ""concept oblige"" au statut épistémologique ambigu-atelier (1999) Ates du deuxième colloque Recherche(s) et formation des enseignants, pp. 27-32. , IUFM Grenoble; Chateauraynaud, F., Incontournables presences.

This attempt takes place within the effort that futures studies have deployed to cope with the need to be 'early' in change processes, and is intended to improve firms' preparedness regarding uncertainties, threats and opportunities. The weak signal notion is one of the metaphors coined to accomplish that, thanks to the seminal role played by Igor Ansoff in the 1970s and 1980s, and the inputs of more recent continuators who have shaped a wide methodological environment. After over 20 years of weak signal exploration, some pending issues suggest the need to re-open some basic hypotheses as well as the use of a wide-angle lens to review the Ansoff legacy and its relevance for management and decision-making. The concepts of framing and meta-framing are the means that will allow us to do this by adding a more reflexive dimension to weak signal analysis, taking account of analysts' and commissioning organisations' own biases, and enhancing firms' robustness against possibly disruptive futures. Pragmatic managerial orientations of how to make use of methodological blends involving reflexive steps will be outlined, also suggesting diverse tracks for further research on weak signal theories and their contributions to both futures studies and strategic management.","Constructivism; Framing; Paradigmatic biases; Reflexivity; Weak signal","decision making; future prospect; hypothesis testing; management practice; signal; strategic approach; theoretical study; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Adam, B., Has the future already happened?

It focuses on how it could be possible to analyse emerging trends from actor's strategies toward the future. The main research question is to understand how early signals of new trends appear in a field which is not formally stabilised. We looked at the spontaneously produced categorisations (folksonomy) of 250 start-ups. This corpus is analysed in order to explore how these descriptions identify key future evolutions and how these categorisations of future trends change over time. Our central hypothesis is to consider that early elements of future changes (weak signals) are not given once and for all, but exist within perpetual shifting processes and could be tracked with folksonomic maps. The discussion of the results will suggest that weak signals should not be conceptualised as static entities blessed with some strange power to shape the future but as a set of components, whose main features are their abilities to be constantly rearranged among themselves by the involved actors.","Folksonomy; Future trends; User driven categorisation; Weak signals; Web 2.0","conceptual framework; future prospect; hypothesis testing; information technology; innovation; Internet; signal; technological change; trend analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Ball, P., (2004) Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another, , Arrow Books, London; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: Designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Third American Conference on Information Systems (AIS) Conference, , Paper presented at the Indianapolis USA; Bloor, D., (1976) Knowledge and Social Imagery, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Berlin, B., (2002) Ethnobiological Classification: Principles of Categorization of Plants and Animals in Traditional Societies, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T.J., (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in The Sociology and The History of Technology, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Bijker, W.E., Law, J., (1992) Shaping Technology/building Society, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Coffman, B., (1997) Weak Signal Research, , MG Taylor Corporation; Fitzgerald, M., Tagging tools offer powerful way to organize information (2006) CIO Magazine; Glassey, O., When taxonomy meets folksonomy: Towards hybrid classification of knowledge?
