Technology entity recognition (TER) is the basis for carrying out subsequent high-level technology analysis works, such as technical foresight, technology roadmap, and technological innovation. However, the challenges TER faces are much greater than that of normal named entity recognition (NER). Those challenges include the difficulty in feature extraction, the lack of annotation data, and the differences between different domains. To deal with the first challenge, we use a deep neural network to extract features from text. For the other two challenges, we propose an adversarial multitask learning method. The existing knowledge from a big dataset on a source domain is transferred to implement TER on a target domain with only a small number of labeled samples. The experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms comparison systems. © 2018 IEEE.","domain adaptation; multitask learning; technology entity recognition; transfer learning","Deep neural networks; Domain adaptation; Entity recognition; Multitask learning; Named entity recognition; Technological innovation; Technology analysis; Technology roadmaps; Transfer learning; Engineering education",,,,,"Augenstein, I., Das, M., Riedel, S., Vikraman, L., McCallum, A., SemEval 2017 Task 10: SciencelE - Extracting keyphrases and relations from scientific publications (2017) Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2017), pp. 546-555. , Canada, August; Prabhakaran, V., Hamilton, W.L., Dan, M., Dan, J., (2016) Predicting the Rise and Fall of Scientific Topics from Trends in Their Rhetorical Framing, pp. 1170-1180. , ACL 2016, Berlin, Germany; Yang, C., Zhu, D., Zhang, G., Semantic-based technology trend analysis (2015) International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Knowledge Engineering, pp. 222-228. , Taipei, China; Canobasave, A.E., Osborne, F., Salatino, A.A., Ontology forecasting in scientific literature:semantic concepts prediction based on innovation-adoption priors (2016) EKAW 2016, pp. 51-67. , Bologna, Italy; Dario, D.N., Dante, D.I., Marco, B., Maristella, A., Carlo, T., A content-based approach to social network analysis: A case study on research communities (2015) IRCDL 2015, pp. 142-154. , Bolzano, Italy; Adar, E., Datta, S., Building a scientific concept hierarchy database (SCHBASE) (2015) Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 606-615. , Beijing, China; Kathy, M., Hal, D., Snigdha, C., John, P., Kapil, T., Pablo, B., Predicting the impact of scientific concepts using full-text features (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology., 67, pp. 2684-2696. , Nov; Meyers, A., Glass, Z., Grieve-Smith, A., He, Y., Liao, S.S., Grishman, R., Jargon-term extraction by chunking (2014) Proceedings of SADAATL2014, pp. 11-20. , Dublin, Ireland; Jin, Y., Kan, M., Ng, J., He, X., Mining scientific terms and their definitions: A study of the ACL anthology (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 780-790. , Seattle, Washington, USA; Kim, S.N., Medelyan, O., Kan, M.Y., Baldwin, T., SemEval-2010 Task 5: Automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific articles (2010) Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, Uppsala, pp. 21-26. , Sweden; Asahara, M., Matsumoto, Y., Japanese named entity extraction with redundant morphological analysis (2003) Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology, pp. 8-15. , Edmonton, Canada; Borthwick, A.E., (1999) A Maximum Entropy Approach to Named Entity Recognition, , Ph.

Drawing on a resource-based view and the organizational support literature, we proposed a model wherein technology roadmapping mediates the indirect relationship between corporate foresight and innovation, and perceived organizational support has a moderating effect on the relationship between technology roadmapping and innovation. We tested this model in a field study involving 212 organizations, finding support for the hypothesized relationships.

Despite the importance of customizing roadmaps to firm/industry specific managerial needs and environmental conditions, the existing literature has focused on the simplified roadmapping process. Little attention has been paid to the customization of roadmaps. Our proposed methodological approach, suggested through a case study, brings together several targeted roadmaps and integrates them into one overarching roadmap — the umbrella roadmap as a new flexible systemic tool. The integrated umbrella roadmap delivers a framework of the industry/company's overall expectations (trends, etc.), whereas targeted roadmaps focus on local targets for a specific product/technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Foresight; Innovation; Strategic planning; Targeted roadmap; Technology roadmaps","Strategic planning; Changing environment; Environmental conditions; Foresight; Media industry; Methodological approach; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Technology roadmaps; Engineering",,,,,"Abbasi, M., Vassilopoulou, P., Stergioulas, L., Technology roadmap for the creative industries (2017) Creative Ind.

The effect of breast conserving treatment in local recurrence and survival rates for the patients who have multicentric breast cancer is still controversial. In our study, we intended to evaluate the foresight of 84 miRNAs which are identified in breast cancer for having differentiated expressions. Thirty-one patients with unifocal and 26 patients with multicentric breast cancer were included in this study. These tissue samples of both malignant and normal breast tissues were kept in RNA later solution at − 80 °C. Eighty-four miRNAs were studied with miScript miRNA PCR Array Human Breast Cancer kit. Fold change, cut off value was accepted as four. In unifocal group, there were 13 upregulated and five downregulated miRNAs and in multicentric group, there were three upregulated and seven downregulated miRNAs. To reach better results for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, it is important to enlighten tumor biology, and pay attention to target and individual therapy. Thus, miRNAs have potential role in identifying tumor characteristics in supporting diagnosis and resulting with better evaluated disease for better treatment results with individual strategies. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Breast cancer;

The use of declared easiness perception is an old idea appearing in the earliest studies by Rand Corporation members, but rarely explored in recent publications. We ran an experiment with 79 students and 43 questions in 2015 and 2016, where the treatment subgroup received the assembled elite feedback, and the control subgroup received statistics based on all panellists.

The world has adopted it as an employment model in the modern era. The flexible online platforms, low development cost, and fast delivery, make freelancing increasingly popular. However, online freelance marketplaces have limited services available and suffer from several issues. New innovations are needed in the freelancing area to overcome these shortcomings. This article presents a detailed comparison and analysis of twelve freelance platforms in terms of their providing features and using technologies. Along with that, this proposes refined foresight suggestions for new freelance platform models. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Humans can imagine both the solution to a problem and the stages along the way [1–3], such as when we plan one or two moves ahead in chess. The extent to which other animals can do the same is far less clear [4–25]. Here, we presented New Caledonian crows with a series of metatool problems where each stage was out of sight of the others and the crows had to avoid either a distractor apparatus containing a non-functional tool or a non-functional apparatus containing a functional tool. Crows were able to mentally represent the sub-goals and goals of metatool problems: crows kept in mind the location and identities of out-of-sight tools and apparatuses while planning and performing a sequence of tool behaviors. This provides the first conclusive evidence that birds can plan several moves ahead while using tools. Gruber et al. presented metatool problems to New Caledonian crows, where each stage of the problem was out of sight of the others. Crows had to mentally represent the location and identities of tools and apparatuses to solve the problems correctly. These results show that New Caledonian crows can preplan several behaviors ahead while using tools. © 2019 The Authors","corvids; foresight; mental representation; metatool use; New Caledonian crow; planning",,,,,,"Ward, G., Allport, A., Planning and Problem solving Using the Five disc Tower of London Task (1997) Q.

Since this endeavor is a complex task, it is necessary to find an efficient solution to do so. Based on foresight workshops with ‘Radar Groups’ – similar to focus groups – Delphi studies, and netnographies of online communities, we develop a pragmatic foresight process. Since we integrate online communities as information sources in our foresight process, we call this ‘open foresight’. This open foresight process focuses upon the topic ‘Aviation 2040’ and is executed with aviation experts and an online community in two steps. This research setting enabled us to show (1) differences and similarities in future assessments and foresight capabilities between experts and online communities and (2) how to efficiently integrate online communities into foresight processes. Combining insights from experts and community members and, in doing so, moving towards ‘Open Radar Groups’ seems to be a beneficial way for conducting foresight and enriching companies’ knowledge base. © 2018 The Authors","Aviation; Delphi study; Focus group; Netnography; Online community; Open foresight","Aviation; Knowledge based systems; Radar; Social networking (online); DELPHI study; Focus groups; Netnography; On-line communities; Open foresight; Online systems; assessment method; Delphi analysis; ethnography; Internet; monitoring; research method",,,,,"Armstrong, J.S., Long Range Forecasting: From Crystal Ball to Computer (1985), second ed.

Conavi's Foresight ICE is a new ICE system that uses a mechanically rotating transducer to generate a 2D conical surface image in 3D space, in contrast to the more typical side-firing phased array. When combined with magnetic tracking technology, this unique imaging geometry poses new calibration challenges and opportunities. Existing ultrasound calibration methods are designed for 2D planar images and cannot be trivially applied to unique 2:5D conical surface images provided by the Foresight ICE system. In this work a spatial and temporal calibration technique applied to the unique case of conical ultrasound image data is described and validated. Precision of calibration parameters is used to quantify the validation of our calibration method and the overall system accuracy is validated using point source and sphere centroid localization. We re-port a maximum error of 5:07mm for point reconstruction accuracy and 1:94mm for sphere centroid localization accuracy. © 2019 SPIE.","Conavi; Intracardiac echocardiography; Radial ultrasound; Ultrasound calibration","Calibration; Echocardiography; Ice; Robotics; Ultrasonic applications; Calibration parameters; Cardiac interventions; Conavi; Intracardiac echocardiographies; Localization accuracy; Point reconstruction; Temporal calibration; Ultrasound calibration; Medical imaging",,,,,"Jongbloed, M.R.M., Schalij, M.J., Zeppenfeld, K., Oemrawsingh, P.V., Van Der Wall, E.E., Bax, J.J., Clinical applications of intracardiac echocardiography in interventional procedures (2005) Heart (British Cardiac Society), 91, pp. 981-990. , jul; Courtney, B., Witcomb, N., (2017) Data Display and Processing Algorithms for 3D Imaging Systems; Mercier, L., Langø, T., Lindseth, F., Collins, D.L., A review of calibration techniques for freehand 3-d ultrasound systems (2005) Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology, 31, pp. 449-471. , apr; Linte, C.A., Rettmann, M.E., Dilger, B., Gunawan, M.S., Arunachalam, S.P., Holmes, D.R., Packer, D.L., Robb, R.A., Calibration and evaluation of a magnetically tracked ice probe for guidance of left atrial ablation therapy (2012) Proceedings of SPIE-the International Society for Optical Engineering, 8316, p. 83162P. , feb; Medical Aurora-Medical, , https://www.ndigital.com/medical/products/aurora/; Lasso, A., Heffter, T., Rankin, A., Pinter, C., Ungi, T., Fichtinger, G., PLUS: Open-source toolkit for ultrasound-guided intervention systems (2014) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 61, pp. 2527-2537. , oct; Fedorov, A., Beichel, R., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Finet, J., Fillion-Robin, J.-C., Pujol, S., Bauer, C., Kikinis, R., 3D slicer as an image computing platform for the quantitative imaging network (2012) Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 30, pp. 1323-1341. , nov; Chen, E.C.S., Peters, T.M., Ma, B., Which point-line registration?

This study developed capabilities of corporate foresight and the ability for companies and organizations to utilize foresight activities successfully. The research methodology of this study was mixed. The first step of this study was to extract components to devise a proposed model. The second step of this study was to validate the proposed model quantitatively. Findings indicate that the proposed framework of the study facilitated the analysis of future scenarios and developed a strategy by incorporating foresight methodologies.

Final demand is affected by consumer foresight, that is, consumers may not anticipate the ex post surplus from the secondary good when purchasing the primary good. We first set up a reduced-form platform model and evaluate the effects of consumer foresight on the platform's optimal decisions. Then, we specialize the analysis in the context of airports, which derive revenues from both aeronautical and, increasingly, commercial activities. An airport sets landing fees and, in addition, it chooses the retail market structure by selecting the number of retail concessions to be awarded. We find that, with perfectly myopic consumers, the airport chooses to attract more passengers via low landing fees, and also sets the minimum possible number of retailers in order to increase the concessions’ revenues. However, even a very small amount of anticipation of the consumer surplus from retail activities changes significantly the airport's choices: the optimal policy is dependent on the degree of differentiation in the retail market. When consumers instead have perfect foresight, the airport establishes a very competitive retail market. This attracts passengers and it is exploited by the airport by charging higher landing fees, which then constitute the largest share of its profits. Overall, the airport's profits are maximal when consumers have perfect foresight. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"(2012) ACI airport economics survey 2012; Armstrong, M., Competition in two-sided markets (2006) Rand Journal of Economics, 37 (3), pp. 669-691; (2014) Global airport benchmarking report 2014; Boudreau, K., Open platform strategies and innovation: Granting access vs. devolving control (2010) Management Science, 56 (10), pp. 1849-1872; Brueckner, J.K., Inter-store externalities and space allocation in shopping centers (1993) Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 7 (1), pp. 5-16; Brueckner, J.K., Proost, S., Carve-outs under airline antitrust immunity (2010) International Journal of Industrial Organization, 28 (6), pp. 657-668; Busse, M.R., Knittel, C.R., Zettelmeyer, F., Are consumers myopic?

First of all, I define futures studies and social futuring and analyse the evolution of futures studies to show how methods have changed and how they could prove useful in the field of social futuring. Furthermore, I examine individual and organizational future orientation and the related “foresight maturity model” that is linked to the idea of social futuring. I compare future orientation indices (e.g. SOFI, JKB) and point out the pros and cons of each. In addition, I also show what kinds of measurement and indices of future orientation could be used in the analysis of individual, organizational and national social futuring.

Researchers in the futures field have a great deal to contribute to the policymaking process. But, futures research is often neglected as an element of policymaking. The aim of this paper is to improve the link between futures research and policymaking. More specifically, as Policy Analysis has a strong link with policymaking, this paper explores the possibility of linking Policy Analysis to the futures field through the use of an uncertainty typology applied in Policy Analysis. The typology can be used to structure the various forward-looking disciplines (or subfields) of the futures field according to the level of uncertainty that they address. This linkage can add significantly to the use of futures research in policymaking. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Forecasting; Foresight; Futures studies; Policy analysis; Uncertainty","forecasting method; future prospect; policy analysis; policy making; research; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Agusdinata, B., Exploratory modelling and analysis: A promising method to deal with deep uncertainty (2008) TRAIL thesis series, Vol. T2008/17. , TRAIL Research School Delft, The Netherlands; Armstrong, J.S., Principles of forecasting, a handbook for researchers and practitioners (2001), Kluwer Academic Publishers Boston/Dordrecht/London; Bekkers, V., Fenger, M., Scholten, P., Public policy in action: Perspectives on the policy process (2017), Edward Elgar Publishing UK, USA; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Towards a user's guide to scenarios – a report on scenario types and scenario techniques.

Nevertheless, with the proposal of the Gaia hypothesis, there has been widespread criticism of some of its elements. Most critiques are related to teleology, the absence of natural selection at a universal scale, and the absence of planetary reproduction. Even if some of the problems concerning the rationale of this hypothesis have been resolved, it is not clear whether Earth can be considered a unit of selection and, therefore, Gaia can adapt according to Darwinian evolution. After Lovelock and Margulis, Gaia has been considered a symbiotic planet composed of biotic (the biosphere) and abiotic (the geosphere-atmosphere) interacting with and coevolving elements. Here, I took into consideration the main concerns raised on the Gaia hypothesis and I analysed them following a logic-deductive reasoning together with thought experiments, sometimes adopting analogical arguments. I propose why and suggest how, a Gaian system, considered as a “symbiotic planet” composed by biotic (the biosphere) and abiotic (the geosphere-atmosphere) interacting and coevolving elements, should be considered alive in an evolutionary sense. I argue that, without invoking teleology, so without any foresight or planning, a Gaian planet can be considered the same as a coevolutionary system analogous to a multicellular body: a super-unit of selection. I describe different situations according to which “Gaia” is able to reproduce and to transfer her planetary genome to other uninhabited or inhabited planets. Then I show that Gaia can face exclusion-competition-coexistence states depending on the fitness of her biota compared to those of the other reproducing biospheres. This demonstrates that Gaia can reproduce and evolve in competition-cooperation with other planets. Some deep implications arise from these pieces of evidence in the light of the recent discovery of a new solar system with Earth-like planets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biophora; Gaia's adaptation; Gaia's evolution; Gaia's reproduction; Symbiosis","abiotic factor; biotic factor; future prospect; Gaia theory; phoresy; symbiosis",,,,,"Bell, E.A., Boehnke, P., Harrison, T.M., Mao, W.L., Potentially biogenic carbon preserved in a 4.1 billion-year-old zircon (2015) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences; Cai, X., Evrony, G.D., Lehmann, H.S., Elhosary, P.C., Mehta, B.K., Poduri, A., Single-cell, genome-wide sequencing identifies clonal somatic copy-number variation in the human brain (2014) Cell Reports, 8 (5), pp. 1280-1289; Cazzolla Gatti, R., Evolution is a cooperative process: The biodiversity-related niches differentiation theory (BNDT) can explain why (2011) Theoretical Biology Forum, 104 (1), pp. 35-43; Cazzolla Gatti, R., Adaptation, evolution and reproduction of Gaia by the means of our species (2017) Theoretical Biology Forum, 110 (1-2), pp. 25-45; Cazzolla Gatti, R., A conceptual model of new hypothesis on the evolution of biodiversity (2016) Biologia, 71 (3), pp. 343-351; Cazzolla Gatti, R., Endogenosymbiosis: From hypothesis to empirical evidence towards a Unified Symbiogenetic Theory (UST) (2018) Theoretical Biology Forum, , Forthcoming; Cazzolla Gatti, R., Trends in human development and environmental protection (2016) International Journal of Environmental Studies, 73 (2), pp. 268-276; Cazzolla Gatti, R., Biodiversity in time and space (2018), Nova Science Publishers New York 352 pp; Cazzolla Gatti, R., Hordijk, W., Kauffman, S., Biodiversity is autocatalytic (2017) Ecological Modelling, 346, pp. 70-76; Cazzolla Gatti, R., Fath, B., Hordijk, W., Kauffman, S., Ulanowicz, R., Niche emergence as an autocatalytic process in the evolution of ecosystems (2018) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 454, pp. 110-117; Checinska, A., Probst, A.J., Vaishampayan, P., White, J.R., Kumar, D., Stepanov, V.G., Microbiomes of the dust particles collected from the International Space Station and Spacecraft Assembly Facilities (2015) Microbiome, 3 (1), pp. 1-18; Chopra, A., Lineweaver, C.H., The case for a Gaian bottleneck: the biology of habitability (2016) Astrobiology, 16 (1), pp. 7-22; Cleeves, L.I., Bergin, E.A., Alexander, C.M.D., Du, F., Graninger, D., Öberg, K.I., The ancient heritage of water ice in the solar system (2014) Science, 345 (6204), pp. 1590-1593; Cleland, C.E., Copley, S.D., The possibility of alternative microbial life on Earth (2005) International Journal of Astrobiology, 4 (3-4), pp. 165-173; Davies, P., The fifth miracle.

This paper develops a standardisation mapping framework for systematic and comprehensive analyses of how standardisation supports innovation, by integrating key ‘dimensions of standardisation’ addressed in existing conceptual models and related literature. A longitudinal case study of photovoltaic technology highlights evolving dynamics of these dimensions over multiple technology lifecycles, thus demonstrating the importance of such holistic and integrative approach. Based on a widely-used foresight tool, the framework can be used to help decision-makers develop more coherent, long-term, and system-wide strategies for standardisation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Complex system; Foresight; Roadmapping; Standard; Technological innovation","Decision making; Large scale systems; Standards; Comprehensive analysis; Foresight; Interdisciplinarity; Longitudinal case study; Modern technologies; Photovoltaic technology; Roadmapping; Technological innovation; Standardization",,,,,"Adams, R.J., Smart, P., Huff, A.S., Shades of grey: guidelines for working with the Grey Literature in systematic reviews for management and organizational studies (2017) Int.

It thus makes it possible to approach the neurobiological mechanisms of two philosophical concepts described in the first article of this thematic file: on the one hand, the “weakness of the will” which can be seen as a philosophical description of non-adherence; on the other hand, it shows how cerebral executive functions are involved in adherence to therapy in chronic diseases: these projective capacities of the brain ensure in particular the neuronal realization of the “foresight principle” which makes it possible to fight against the natural tendency to prefer the immediate and concrete rewards of non-adherence rather than those, distant and abstract, that makes adherence possible. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Adherence; executive functions; fonctions exécutives; neuro-économie; neuroeconomy; Observance thérapeutique; patient therapeutic education; éducation thérapeutique du patient","Article; chronic disease; decision making; economic aspect; executive function; human; neurobiology; patient compliance",,,,,"Reach, G., Les bases philosophiques de l'observance (2018) Médecine des maladies Métaboliques, 12, pp. 473-479; Rangel, A., Camerer, C., Montague, P.R., A framework for studying the neurobiology of value-based decision making (2008) Nat Rev Neurosci, 9, pp. 545-556; Raynal, F., Rieunier, A., Pédagogie, dictionnaire des concepts clés : Apprentissage, formation, psychologie cognitive (2014) Collection Pédagogies, , ESF éditeur Issyles-Moulineaux; Naudin, D., Gagnayre, R., Marchand, C., Reach, G., Éducation thérapeutique du patient : une analyse du concept de motivation (2018) Médecine des maladies Métaboliques, 12, p. 7987; Damasio, A.R., L'Erreur de Descartes : la raison des émotions (2010) Traduction par Marcel Blanc, , Odile Jacob Paris; Insel, K.C., Reminger, S.L., Hsiao, C.P., White mat-ter hyperintensities and medication adherence (2008) Biol Res Nurs, 10, pp. 121-127; Spitznagel, M.B., Galioto, R., Limbach, K., Cognitive function is linked to adherence to baria-tric postoperative guidelines (2013) Surg Obes Relat Dis, 9, pp. 580-585; Spitznagel, M.B., Alosco, M., Galioto, R., The role of cognitive function in postoperative weight loss outcomes: 36-month follow-up (2014) Obes Surg, 24, pp. 1078-1084; Whitelock, V., Nouwen, A., van den Akker, O., Higgs, S., The role of working memory sub-com-ponents in food choice and dieting success (2018) Appetite, 124, p. 2432; Benhamou, P.Y., (2018) L'observance thérapeutique à l'heure du numérique et des objets connectés, 12, pp. 502-510; Rolls, E.T., Emotion and decision-making explained: a précis (2014) Cortex, 59, p. 18593; Tversky, A., Kahneman, D., The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice (1981) Science, 211, p. 4538; McNeil, B.J., Pauker, S.G., Tversky, A., Jr, Sox, H.C., On the elicitation of preferences for alternative therapies (1982) N Engl J Med, 306, pp. 1259-1262; Kahneman, D., Tversky, A., Prospect theory: an analysis of decision under risk (1979) Econometrica, 47, pp. 263-291; Reach, G., A psychophysical account of patient non-adherence to medical prescriptions (2013) The case of insulin dose adjustment.

One of the suggestions in the frontline has been the finding, developing and utilizing of alternative, non-conventional building materials including the potential used of lightweight foamed concrete. This research focuses on potential use of carbon fibremesh fabric reinforced lightweight foamed concrete. Three densities of lightweight foamed concrete of 800kg/m3, 1100kg/m3 and 1400kg/m3 will be cast and tested with 3 different types of carbon fibremesh fabric which are CF-130, CF-145 and CF-160. The parameters that will be evaluated are compressive strength and bending strength. The results obtained showed that for all densities, the introduction of carbon fibremesh fabric (CF-130, CF-145 and CF-160) in lightweight foamed concrete aid crack control, in which this carbon fibremesh fabric improved the flexural strength, compressive strength and splitting strength of lightweight foamed concrete. Carbon fibremesh fabric is softer, so it just disperses the deformation stress. © 2018 Author(s).",,,,,,,"Tramboveckij, V.P., (2013) Concrete Technology, 4, pp. 37-39. , (Composite XXI century, Moscow), (2013); Rabinovich, F.N., (2004) Composites Based on Fiber Reinforced Concrete, p. 560. , (ASV Publ., Moscow); Kim, K.H., Jeon, S.-E., Kim, J.K., Yang, S., (2003) Cement and Concrete Research, 33, pp. 363-371; Shah, S.P., Kuder, K.G., Mu, B., (2004) 6th International RILEM Symposium on Fibre Reinforced Concretes (BEFIB 2004), pp. 3-30. , Varenna-Lecco, Italy; Mydin, M.A.O., Noordin, N.M., Utaberta, N., Yunos, M.Y.M., Segeranazan, S., (2016) Jurnal Teknologi, 78 (5), pp. 99-105; Soleimanzadeh, S., Mydin, M.A.O., (2013) International Journal of Engineering, 26 (1), pp. 365-374; Nitta, Y., Goda, K., Noda, J., W-Ii, L., (2013) Applied Science & Manufacturing, 49, pp. 132-138; Amran, Y.H.M., Farzadnia, N., Ali, A.A.A., (2015) Const. & Bldg.

CSU requires both collective insight-i.e., accurate and deep understanding of a situation derived from uncertain and often sparse data and collective foresight-i.e., the ability to predict what will happen in the future. When it comes to complex scenarios, the need for a distributed CSU naturally emerges, as a single monolithic approach not only is unfeasible: It is also undesirable. We therefore propose a principled, critical analysis of AI techniques that can support specific tasks for CSU to derive guidelines for designing distributed systems for CSU. © 2018 ISIF","artificial intelligence for situational understanding; collective situational understanding; critical analysis of artificial intelligence techniques","Artificial intelligence; AI techniques; Artificial intelligence techniques; collective situational understanding; Critical analysis; Distributed systems; Information environment; Monolithic approach; Specific tasks; Information fusion",,,,,"(2016) Understandig: Joint Doctrine Publication 04 (JDP 04)., , Ministry of Defence, UK; (2018) Autonomous Weapons Are A Game-changer.

This paper identifies possible futures in two ways: extrapolating from the present into the future, and starting from future states to reconstruct how they might be arrived at from the current state.

Additionally, we aimed to elucidate whether the ScO2 measurements of both devices can be used interchangeably to detect reduced SvO2. Methods: Forty-eight spontaneously breathing patients extubated after cardiac surgery were included in this prospective observational study. The patients were exposed to both high (10 oxygen L·min−1 via face mask) and low (room air) inspiratory oxygen concentrations. Bi-hemispherical ScO2 was determined with the INVOS and ForeSight Elite cerebral oximeters. The SvO2 was measured with a pulmonary artery catheter. Results: Significant changes in oxygen delivery, ScO2 (by both cerebral oximeters), and SvO2 were observed upon variation of oxygenation. The minimum mean (standard deviation) ScO2 (ScO2min) using the INVOS and ForeSight did not differ significantly during high oxygen delivery [63.1 (8.6) % vs 65.8 (4.7) %, respectively; P = 0.07], but during low oxygen delivery, the INVOS value was significantly lower than that of the ForeSight oximeter [56.7 (8.9) % vs 61.3 (4.4) %, respectively; P = 0.003]. Both devices differed in the correlation between ScO2min and SvO2 for the combined oxygenation data (0.59, INVOS vs 0.28, ForeSight; correlation difference, 0.31; Bonferroni-adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08 to 0.54; P = 0.008). The receiver-operating curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.9; P = 0.005) for detecting an SvO2 below 50% by ScO2min with the INVOS and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.62; P = 0.92), respectively, with the ForeSight. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the cerebral oximeters tested react differently to variations in systemic oxygenation and in their relationship with SvO2 and thus give different information on cardiopulmonary function. These findings raise doubt about whether these devices should be used interchangeably. © 2018, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.",,"aged; arterial oxygen saturation; Article; brain oxygen tension;

The result is varied. It is necessary to develop a foresight approach for the mixed situation. This work pioneers to forecast effectiveness of asset restructuring with a rebalanced and clustered support vector machine (RCS). The profitability variation 1 year before and after asset restructuring is used as the dependent variable. The current financial indicators of the year of asset restructuring are used as independent variables. Specially treated listed companies are used as research samples, as they frequently adopt asset restructuring. In modeling, the skew distribution of samples achieving and failing to achieve performance improvement with asset restructuring is handled with rebalancing. The similar experienced knowledge of asset restructuring to the current asset restructuring is filtered out with clustering. With the help from rebalancing and clustering, a support vector machine is constructed for prediction, together with other forecasting models of multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, probit regression, and case-based reasoning. These models' standalone modes are used as benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate the applicability of the RCS for forecasting effectiveness of asset restructuring.

We found that foresight can support open innovation by providing analysis that looks at key open innovation questions such as those around technology selection, identifying future customer needs and scanning for disruptions. Foresight can also help open innovation address some of the challenges that have been identified in the open innovation literature as barriers to effective open innovation. Foresight has experience around obtaining access to appropriate external experts and their knowledge; making sense of the mass of information that can emerge through a more open process, both areas that the open innovation literature has identified as being challenges to effective open innovation. Finally, a concept explored in this paper, foresight networks offer’s open innovation new ideas in innovative collaboration forms and how they can be pivotal in innovation and in assisting open innovation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collaboration; foresight network; innovation management process; Open innovation","accessibility; conceptual framework; innovation; technological development; technology adoption",,,,,"Archibugia, D., Pietrobelli, C., Knowledge Sharing in an Organization (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (8), pp. 1128-1156; Bondarenko, N., The Role of Companies in Human Capital Accumulation: Cross-Country Analysis (2015) Foresight-Russia, 9 (2), pp. 22-37; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The Origins and Evolution of Scenario Techniques in Long Range Business Planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Calof, J., Smith, J., Critical Success Factors for Government-Led Foresight (2010) Science and Public Policy, 37 (1), pp. 31-40; Calof, J., Smith, J., Foresight Impacts from Around the World: A Special Issue (2012) Foresight, 14 (1), pp. 5-14; Campanella, F., Del Giudice, M., Thrassou, A., Vrontis, D., Ambidextrous Organizations in the Banking Sector: An Empirical Verification of Banks’ Performance and Conceptual Development (2016) The International Journal of Human Resource Management, pp. 1-31; Carayannis, E.G., Meissner, D., Glocal Targeted Open Innovation: Challenges, Opportunities and Implications for Theory, Policy and Practice (2016) The Journal of Technology Transfer, 2016, pp. 1-17. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10961-016-9497-0; Cassingena Harper, J., (2013), http://www.innovation-policy.org.uk/compendium/section/Default.aspx?topicid=31, Impact of Technology Foresight on Innovation Policy.” Innovation-policy.org.uk.

We study the role of unique dyad-specific synergies in the selection of takeover targets in the global mobile telecommunications industry. Firms use their foresight to select specific targets: First, they lower integration costs by selecting geographically close targets. This effect is stronger when buyer and target are in the same country, but only if the market is not so concentrated that it provokes regulatory interventions. Second, they select targets that can be acquired at a modest bid premium because they have asymmetric bargaining power. Finally, they select targets which can generate significant synergies due to technological synergies. Our work expands the existing target selection literature by studying dyad-specific factors within a single industry. This helps us in identifying unique synergies as drivers of acquisition performance. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Associazione ICC.

The author of this article presented his own concept of quality improvement in an organization, which can also be a method for the strategic management and development of various aspects of the organization. The universality of the concept as a tool that is supported by the foresight methodology brings tangible results, as shown through “quality foresight” at the micro (unit) level. The case examined indicates that each organization should be analyzed individually while retaining the foresight methodology and process. The study also showed that the application of foresight determines the organizational, management and social changes that influence the innovativeness (including the diversification of technological processes and automation), production dynamics (increase by 260%), sales and quality in the organization. The presented research results indicate that “quality foresight” can potentially become a trend that includes the main strength of quality improvement, the improvement of competitiveness, and the productivity and efficiency in organization development. © 2018, University of Finance and Management in Warsaw.

The environment of these problems consists of an open market with two firms (leader and follower), several customers and locations where facilities can be located. In order to capture the demand of the customers, the leader enters the market by locating a set of facilities knowing the potential locations where the follower can locate her facilities after the leader's decision. We consider here three pairs of objective functions for the leader/follower previously studied in the literature: maximizing/minimizing the demand captured by the leader, minimizing/maximizing the regret of the leader, maximizing the demand captured by each firm (also known as Stackelberg). For each model, we propose an integer linear programming formulation with a polynomial number of variables and an exponential number of constraints. The formulations are solved by branch-and-cut algorithms where the constraints are generated on demand by solving appropriate separation problems. We report extensive computational experiments realized on instances inspired by those from the literature, comparing our algorithms with the exact and heuristic algorithms previously published for these problems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Combinatorial optimization; Competitive location; Integer programming; Maximal covering location problem; Stackelberg problem","Combinatorial optimization; Commerce; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Location; Optimization; Site selection; Branch-and-cut algorithms; Competitive location; Computational experiment; Integer linear programming formulation; Integer programming formulations; Maximal covering location problems; Objective functions; Stackelberg problems; Problem solving",,,,,"Bard, J.F., Moore, J.T., An algorithm for the discrete bilevel programming problem (1992) NavalResearchLogistics(NRL), 39 (3), pp. 419-435; Ben-Tal, A., El Ghaoui, L., Nemirovski, A., Robust optimization (2009), Princeton University Press; Church, R., Velle, C.R., The maximal covering location problem (1974) Papers in Regional Science, 32 (1), pp. 101-118; Daskin, M.S., Network and discrete location: Models, algorithms, and applications (2011), John Wiley & Sons; Eiselt, H., Laporte, G., Competitive spatial models (1989) European Journal of Operational Research, 39 (3), pp. 231-242; Eiselt, H., Laporte, G., Sequential location problems (1997) European Journal of Operational Research, 96 (2), pp. 217-231; Eiselt, H., Laporte, G., Thisse, J., Competitive location models: A framework and bibliography (1993) Transportation Science, 27 (1), pp. 44-54; Fischetti, M., Ljubic, I., Monaci, M., Sinnl, M., Intersection cuts for bilevel optimization (2016) Proceedings of the IPCO 2016, liège, belgium, june 1–3, 2016, pp. 77-88; Friesz, T., Miller, T., Tobin, R., Competitive network facility location models: a survey (1988) Papers in Regional Science, 65 (1), pp. 47-57; Hakimi, S., On locating new facilities in a competitive environment (1983) European Journal of Operational Research, 12 (1), pp. 29-35; Israeli, E., Wood, R.K., Shortest-path network interdiction (2002) Networks, 40 (2), pp. 97-111; Kouvelis, P., Yu, G., Robust discrete optimization and its applications (2013), 14. , Springer Science & Business Media; Kress, D., Pesch, E., Sequential competitive location on networks (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 217 (3), pp. 483-499; Labbé, M., Violin, A., Bilevel programming and price setting problems (2013) 4OR, 11 (1), pp. 1-30; Moore, J.T., Bard, J.F., The mixed integer linear bilevel programming problem (1990) Operations Research, 38 (5), pp. 911-921; Noltemeier, H., Spoerhase, J., Wirth, H., Multiple voting location and single voting location on trees (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 181 (2), pp. 654-667; O'Hanley, J.R., Church, R.L., Designing robust coverage networks to hedge against worst-case facility losses (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 209 (1), pp. 23-36; Plastria, F., Vanhaverbeke, L., Discrete models for competitive location with foresight (2008) Computers & Operations Research, 35 (3), pp. 683-700; Roboredo, M.C., Pessoa, A.A., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the discrete (r| p)-centroid problem (2013) European Journal of Operational Research, 224, pp. 101-109; Serra, D., Ratick, S., ReVelle, C., The maximum capture problem with uncertainty (1996) Environment and Planning B, 23, pp. 49-59; Serra, D., ReVelle, C., Market capture by two competitors: The preemptive location problem (1994) Journal of Regional Science, 34 (4), pp. 549-561; Seyhan, T.H., (2012) Network design under competition, , Lehigh University Dissertation; Taşkın, Z.C., Smith, J.C., Ahmed, S., Schaefer, A.J., Cutting plane algorithms for solving a stochastic edge-partition problem (2009) Discrete Optimization, 6 (4), pp. 420-435","Costa Roboredo, M.; Departamento de Engenharia de Produção, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Rua Passo da Pátria 156, Brazil; email: mcroboredo@id.uff.br",,,"Elsevier B.V.",,,,,03772217,,EJORD,,"English","Eur J Oper Res",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030248265

We complement existing studies by adopting a dynamic perspective that allows us to introduce a learning process in choice and adjustment of contract duration. On the basis of French panel data (1995–2003), collected from the yearbooks of the French Federation of Franchising, results of dynamic models are consistent with the existence of a learning process in the capacity to design appropriate contracts. Our study shows that certain factors, in particular too much franchising, may hinder the achievement of such a capability.

In the case of bitcoin, its category is not clear. I consider the superficial subjective value argument often put forward by nonmonetary economists and a more sophisticated payments technology argument. After dismissing both, I argue that there are two reasonable views on the value of bitcoin. One might claim bitcoin lacks intrinsic worth, in which case its value depends on foresight and coordination. Alternatively, one might claim that bitcoin has intrinsic worth, even if no one else accepts it, because some users have peculiar preferences. In either case, bitcoin’s existence calls into question the practical relevance of the regression theorem. © 2018, Fayetteville State University.

The film’s queer temporal and spatial logics invite these two to recognize each other – a shared recognition into which I am also drawn. Already a part of the queer film canon because a lesbian relationship drives Mulholland’s plot, my trans reading adds a new perspective to the growing literature on queer spectatorship. Here in ‘this Winkie’s’ fragmentation, circuitive desires, and cross-identifications transpose onto transtemporal ruptures. If cinema is a somatechnics – a crafting of bodies – it is important to consider the ways spectatorship is informed by trans viewers. In this essay, I demonstrate usages of trans male practices that connect new phenomenological links between embodiment and cinematic experience. My primary concern is to explore how a cinematic body looks, thereby bridging a trans viewer to cinema. After Diane and Dan share a passing glance, Lynch’s fragmentary aesthetics suggest that perhaps I, not Lynch, am the man behind Winkie’s, and Dan, with trans insight/foresight, can see me through the wall. Dan and Diane are waiting in Winkie’s for me to see them and recognize them, just as they briefly recognize each other. © Edinburgh University Press.","Boys Don’t Cry; Gaze; Mulholland Drive; Spectatorship; Trans cinema; Transgender",,,,,,"Burns, B., (1999) Cassandras Eyes,’ in out Takes: Essays on Queer Theory and Film, pp. 129-150. , ed.

The article starts with various definitions of technology foresight from the literature and new definition is given by the authors. Elements of widely accepted foresight definitions are analyzed and depicted on a table according to the number of references in the definitions. Based on the literature analysis, foresight generations are grouped into four main categories. Foresight frameworks are analyzed and a generic foresight functional model with nine consecutive phases named 'FORESIGHT' is suggested. Functions in the FORESIGHT model are matched with the phases of prominent foresight frameworks in the literature based on their actions and artifacts within specific phases. FPM is a new technology foresight approach which has three interdependent modules; Resources, Methodology and Futures Strategies. Model makes use of periscope resemblance, that is, resources and methodology are underlying parts that enable an organization to see alternative futures and provide futures strategies to follow in order to survive and compete in the environment. Resources that can be used in a foresight exercise are explained. Foresight methods in the literature are grouped according to various criteria and the approach to choose the right methods to create proper methodology is stated. The model concludes with futures strategies which put foresight process into action by taking advantage of underlying resources and methodology. FPM does not impose a specific methods or process to attain the desired future. It provides a framework for practitioners to start with and to complete a foresight exercise by using optimum resources and proper methodology. © 2017 IEEE.","foresight methods; future strategies; technology foresight; technology foresight frameworks; technology foresight models","Optical instruments; foresight methods; Functional model; Future strategy; Literature analysis; New technologies; Technology foresight; Engineering research",,,,,"Schatzmann, J., Schäfer, R., Eichelbaum, F., Foresight 2.0-Definition, overview & evaluation (2013) Eur.

It was conducted by the successor generation of faststream diplomats and was eventually completed in 2000. The Foresight Report was never released into the public domain, and indeed its existence was not openly acknowledged for a further 3 years. In particular, a controversial ""memo to ministers,"" criticising the interaction between elected officials and diplomats, created a major stir behind the scenes. Its discussions of digital technologies and the role of public discourse in diplomacy paint a compelling picture of the institution in a process of irreversible change. As a document marking the crossroads between the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, Foresight provides crucial insight into the currents and trends motivating diplomatic reform. This article focuses upon visions of twenty-first century British diplomacy from the perspective of the late 1990s. Its particular point of interest is in the trajectories surrounding the future of diplomats, digital technologies, public diplomacy, and the integration of the FCO in Whitehall. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cool Britannia; Foreign & Commonwealth Office; Public diplomacy; Soft power; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Brown, G., (1998) Modern Public Services for Britain: Investing in Reform Comprehensive Spending Review: New Public Spending Plans 1999-2002 (July 1998), , The Stationary Office Ltd London; Cornago, N., (2013) Plural Diplomacies: Normative Predicaments and Functional Imperatives, , Martinus Nijhoff Publishers Leiden & Boston; Council, D., (1997) New Brand for a New Britain, , The Design Council London; Dickie, J., (2004) The New Mandarins: How British Foreign Policy Works, , I.B.

Modern enterprises are interested in receiving reasonable foresight forecasts in marketing, which was not sufficiently distributed in the practical activity of the enterprise. Theoretical and practical aspects of the foresight framework are still explored insufficiently. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to improve the theoretical framework of foresight marketing and to create the conceptual model of foresight marketing. The following scientific methods have been used in this research: system analysis, content analysis, comparative method, method of logical generalization, morphological method, dialectics of the relationship between fundamental and applied knowledge. The analysis revealed imperfection of the theoretical apparatus of foresight marketing, thus, the modern approach to the interconnection and balance of foresight marketing and strategic marketing on the enterprises was suggested. To develop a conceptual model of foresight marketing, the authors have considered and described its major components. A conceptual model of foresight marketing is a systematic combination of certain elements, namely: conditions, barriers, and prerequisites; subject and object; methodology of foresight marketing; principles, tools, and categories. The article presents a generalized model of foresight marketing process, which shows the basic subjects and bases on four consecutive stages. The authors provide a new perspective as for the concept of foresight marketing and the basic prerequisites for the implementation of foresight in marketing management. © 2015 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

Our research reveals that global connectivity rates differ dramatically for various countries and correspondingly, their populations. What will this picture look like in, say, 50 years? We combine demographic projections with our knowledge on the recent dynamics of national rates of global connectivity to estimate the proportion of world population which is expected to live in countries with varying rates of global connectivity. We show that the distribution of world population among the states with various rates of global connectivity is bound to experience significant changes in the coming decades, which should be taken into account at various attempts of providing global foresight.

This is resulting in a narrowing of scholarship: of methods, of theorizing and of ways in which we write our accounts. I suggest that one way of addressing the situation is to build a more pluralistic scholarship of possibilities, one that requires us to humanify ourselves and others.

Design is seen as key differentiator in creating innovative offerings but few design methods consider future technologies explicitly. In this article, we explore how a foresight method, namely horizon scanning, may be applied in a design context to anticipate disruption of construction. By means of a 3-step horizon scan, we identify 133 potentially disruptive technologies from across industries. We find that when preparing for disruption, design may benefit from the future-oriented and technology-focused features of horizon scanning. © 2018 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture.","Design methods; Digital design; Disruption; Horizon scanning; Technology development","Scanning; Design method; Digital designs; Disruption; Horizon scanning; Technology development; Design",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Könnölä, T., Leis, M., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: Lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39 (2), pp. 208-221. , https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scs017; Bower, J., Christensen, C.M., Disruptive technologies-catching the wave (1995) Harvard Business Review, 73 (1), p. 155. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0024-6301(95)91075-1; Cheng, Y., Huang, L., Ramlogan, R., Li, X., Forecasting of potential impacts of disruptive technology in promising technological areas: Elaborating the sirs epidemic model in RFID technology (2017) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 117, pp. 170-183. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2016.12.003; Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Harvard Business Review Press, Boston; Christensen, C.M., Raynor, M.E., (2003) The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth, , Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation; Christensen, C.M., Raynor, M., McDonald, R., What is disruptive innovation?

For even in the simplest of environments where it is supposed that there is perfect foresight, one is concerned not merely with the optimal depletion of exhaustible resources but with the optimal rate of investment as well. The two must plainly be interrelated. The latter problem on its own is hard, and the combined problem is very complex. In fact it will appear in the course of the arguments that follow that intuition is not a very good guide for this joint problem. In any case, the assumption of perfect foresight is particularly dubious here since it would appear almost immediate that an investigation of intertemporal plans in the presence of exhaustible resources readily invites consideration of the possibilities of large-scale alterations in technology at dates in the future that are inherently uncertain. Moreover, it is clear that such extensive technological changes would not be achievable costlessly. In this paper, therefore, we attempt to demonstrate how one might, in a relatively simple manner, bring such considerations as these to bear on a set of questions that have generated a considerable amount of interest in recent years. 0.2.

His early development of computational models to describe oscillatory responses of neural masses allowed him to predict physiological and anatomical properties, some of which required decades of research to be confirmed. His models of neural masses therefore allow us to link between basic physiology and cognitive processes. Through the study of brain physiology at the mesoscopic level, we can understand how internally generated meaning-based responses to sensory input become action and how action leads to perception. © Imprint Academic 2017.",,,,,,,"Agarwal, G., Stevenson, I.H., Berényi, A., Mizuseki, K., Buzsáki, G., Sommer, F.T., Spatially distributed local fields in the hippocampus encode rat position (2014) Science, 344, pp. 626-630;

But R v. Jogee, decided by the UK Supreme Court in 2016, is exceptional in its nature. It provoked a new discourse on a mental element in complicity in a highly controversial situation where the principal went beyond the scope of what was agreed, or in civil law language, excessu mandati. Following Jogee, common law is likely to move in the direction of implementing in a more coherent way the idea of a subjective fault standard for a mental element in complicity. Paradoxically, civil law systems are now much closer to pre-Jogee jurisprudence so there is good reason to conduct comparative analysis at this point. © 2018, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

Fruitful initial answers have been provided by what have now become classics of the field, such as the pioneering Art of Conjecture by De Jouvenel (1967) or the extensive Foundations of Future Studies by Bell (2011). Poli (2011) provides a more detailed reconstruction of the field. More recently a series of five workshops, called the Futures Meeting (FuMee, 2013) used the European COST initiative on foresight methodologies (2011) as a springboard for research into the founding principles, cross-cutting foundations and key concepts that define the evolving field of Futures Studies (see Miller and Poli, 2010 for papers published from the first FuMee). A recent issue of On the Horizon (Poli, 2013, p. 1) adds further elements to the discussion.

Common explanations are planners have little power, they fail to account for political or environmental uncertainty in the plans or they failed to include enough voices during the planning process. The theoretical frameworks on which we base our understanding of plans focus on implementation as a key evaluative mechanism. I challenge the premise that plans realise their potential only when they are implemented. Monitoring implementation of plans presupposes that we know what plans there are to monitor. Such monitoring privileges published plans and ignores all the other plans that guide urban development. It assumes that the decision situations in which plans are used are observable. By jettisoning implementation as a key criterion by which to evaluate the effectiveness of plans, we can begin to focus on the myriad ways in which plan makers and others use plans. We can instead ask, ‘How are these plans used? Who uses them? When are they useful? How to make useful plans?’ With these questions, we can create different evaluative frameworks for different types of plans. Some unimplementable plans are worth making. © The Author(s) 2018.","conformance; evaluation; implementation; performance; plan use",,,,,,"Abbot, J., Understanding and managing the unknown: The nature of uncertainty in planning (2005) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 24 (3), pp. 237-251; Ackoff, R.L., On the use of models in corporate planning (1981) Strategic Management Journal, 2 (4), pp. 353-359; Albrechts, L., Balducci, A., Practicing strategic planning: In search of critical features to explain the strategic character of plans (2013) disP – The Planning Review, 49 (3), pp. 16-27; Alexander, E.R., If planning isn’t everything, maybe its something (1981) The Town Planning Review, 52 (2), pp. 131-142; Alexander, E.R., Alterman, R., Law-Yone, H., Evaluating plan implementation: The national statutory planning system in Israel (1983) Progress in Planning, 20, pp. 101-172; Alexander, E.R., Faludi, A., Planning and plan implementation: Notes on evaluation criteria (1989) Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 16 (2), pp. 127-140; Alterman, R., Hill, M., Implementation of urban land use plans (1978) Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 44 (3), pp. 274-285; Altshuler, A., The goals of comprehensive planning (1965) Journal of American Institute of Planners, 31 (3), pp. 186-197; Baer, W.C., General plan evaluation criteria: An approach to making better plans (1997) Journal of the American Planning Association, 63 (3), pp. 329-344; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., (2009) Agendas and Instability in American Politics, , 2nd edn., Chicago, IL, The University of Chicago Press; Berke, P.R., Backhurst, M., Day, M., What makes plan implementation successful?

To weaken this assumption, a class of games (called games with short sight) was proposed in literature, modelling the game scenarios where players have only limited foresight of the game tree due to bounded resources and limited computational ability. As a consequence, the notions of equilibria in classical game theory were refined to fit games with short sight. A crucial issue that thus arises is to determine whether a strategy profile is a solution to a game. To study this issue and address the underlying idea and theory on players' decisions in such games, we adopt a logical way. Specifically, we develop a logic called DLS through which features of these games are demonstrated. More importantly, it enables us to characterize the solutions to these games via formulas of this logic. Moreover, we study the algorithm for model checking DLS, which is shown to be PTIME-complete in the size of the model. This work not only provides an insight into a more realistic model in game theory, but also enriches the possible applications of logic. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

Such observations are not representative of the elevated distant foresights found in most archaeoastronomical sites. It has been shown (e.g. Young 2004) that the magnitude and variability of refraction is exceptionally strong near the horizon and decreases rapidly with increasing angular altitude. A recent study of refraction in archaeoastronomical contexts has demonstrated from meteorological principles the influence of strong temperature gradients near the earth's surface, the importance of local topography on refraction for low lines of sight, and from geometrical analysis the importance of refraction near the distant horizon marker and the relative unimportance of refraction near the observer. Quantitative investigation of this phenomenon shows that the magnitude of refraction at elevated horizon markers is reduced by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to refraction over flat terrain (McCluskey 2017). The current investigation extends the previous study to consider geometric factors as they relate to the calculation of refraction, the variability of atmospheric refraction, and the relative importance of different meteorological parameters. This investigation closes by discussing the methods of computing refraction that are appropriate to various levels of precision. The results of this investigation and of prior work (McCluskey 2017) account for the consistency inferred from ethnographic reports of Puebloan astronomical observations and call for a positive reevaluation of the possible precision of archaeoastronomical alignments to distant horizon markers. © 2018 MAA.","Archaeoastronomical sites; Astronomical refraction; Methodology; Observational consistency; Temperature gradient; Terrestrial refraction",,,,,,"Auer, L.H., Standish, E.M., Astronomical refraction: Computational method for all zenith angles (2000) The Astronomical Journal, 119, pp. 2472-2474. , originally submitted 1970; Bomford, G., (1980) Geodesy, , 4th. ed.

The arguments either way do not address the question whether there are short-term goals within rather than external to organisms. Organisms and their interacting populations have evolved mechanisms by which they can harness blind stochasticity and so generate rapid functional responses to environmental challenges. They can achieve this by re-organising their genomes and/or their regulatory networks. Epigenetic as well as DNA changes are involved. Evolution may have no foresight, but it is at least partially directed by organisms themselves and by the populations of which they form part. Similar arguments support partial direction in the evolution of behavior. © 2017 by the authors.

Although there is a vast literature dealing with the classification and development of technology foresight methods (TFMs), the problem of selecting those that best reflect the characteristics of an organization is challenging and remains mostly overlooked. We propose a TFM evaluation procedure that allows decision makers and managers to successfully address this problem. The proposed procedure identifies the most relevant TFMs and organizational criteria and uses them in a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) model to select the most suitable method(s) for implementation. The proposed MCA model combines the doubling data technique with a row principal scoring procedure to allow for the reduction of dimensionality and, consequently, the graphical analysis of the patterns of relationships among TFMs and evaluation criteria. We present a case study in a knowledge-based organization to demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed evaluation procedure. The results show that the proposed model can be properly adapted to allow for a wide range of applications involving business organizations and government agencies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Evaluation and selection; Extrapolation method; Multiple correspondence analysis; Quantitative and qualitative criteria; Technology development; Technology foresight","Extrapolation; Knowledge based systems; Evaluation and selection; Extrapolation methods; Multiple correspondence analysis; Qualitative criteria; Technology development; Technology foresight; Decision making; correspondence analysis; numerical model; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; technological development",,,,,"Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, 46, pp. 23-40; Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Innovation system foresight (2014) Technol.

Designers face methodological obstacles, however, when engaging with a future system with rapidly changing factors. First, the system's users do not yet exist. Second, continuing changes in key factors and their interactions make conceiving of relationships and delivering synthesizable data impossible. The rational core for making projections suffers from a lack of substantiation. Both morphological analysis and the Delphi method are established tools in strategic foresight. We suggest that a morphology-based Delphi method supports the process of projecting future outcomes in innovative, complex projects. In addition, each tool compensates for the other's theoretical and functional deficits by illustrating transparent, value-based arguments in a modifiable, iterative manner. © 2017 Tongji University and Tongji University Press","Delphi method; Future-oriented design; Morphological analysis; Scenario development; Strategic foresight; Systemic design",,,,,,,"Mozuni, M.; Institute of Transportation Design (ITD), Braunschweig University of ArtGermany; email: me.mozuni@hbk-bs.de",,,"Tongji University Press",,,,,24058726,,,,"English","She Ji",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059820703

There is little scientific research on daily work in restaurants. Through interviews and observations in restaurant kitchens, three head chef practices were detected: “Master the materiality” is a stipulation for leading kitchens, but does not imply leadership aspirations; “show and guide” is teambuilding through which standards are reinforced by the presence of leaders while allowing coworkers some freedom; and “overview and foresight” involves nonhierarchical supervision by head chefs during service. These practices make sense to head chefs as they enhance product quality and their reputations as professionals. The study points to a horizontal leadership in the restaurant industry and a possible new order for growth and development. © 2017 Taylor & Francis","craft knowledge; leadership; practice theory; Restaurants; “interview to the double”",,,,,,,"Wellton, L.email: lotte.wellton@oru.se",,,"Routledge",,,,,15256480,,,,"English","Int.

Moreover, players’ views on the underlying game vary from person to person. Based on some existing work on modelling players’ limited foresight in games, we study several interesting types of players in terms of the characteristics of their actual views. The underlying model is closely connected to the well-known algorithm called α−β pruning, and an algorithmic procedure refining classical backward-induction is designed for strategy choosing in the actual process of playing such games. Further, we study the dynamic evolution of players’ foresight and show the resulting preference change. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Computational power; Dynamics; Games","Computational methods; Dynamics; Algorithmic procedure; Backward induction; Computational ability; Computational power; Dynamic evolution; Games; Individual Differences; Preference change; Mathematical techniques",,,,,"GuiQuan, S., SuLan, W., Qian, R., Zhen, J., YongPing, W., Effects of time delay and space on herbivore dynamics: linking inducible defenses of plants to herbivore outbreak (2015) Sci.

In this paper I shift focus away from more familiar questions about the ground of promissory obligation, concentrating instead on the familiar way that making a promise involves claiming another’s trust. Borrowing an idea from Nietzsche, I suggest that we understand this in terms of a “right to make promises” - that is, a right to “stand security for ourselves,” held and exercised by those who possess the foresight and self-control to make only promises they can keep, and the strength of will required to keep the promises they make. Others recognize a person’s right to promise precisely by taking her at her word i.e. by treating her promise itself as a sound and sufficient basis for the belief that she will do as promised. The main aim of the paper is to explicate and defend these ideas. At the end of the paper, I suggest how focusing on this aspect of promising brings to the fore some neglected problems of social justice, concerning the actual distribution of the right to give one’s word in our society. © 2017 Jorah Dannenberg.",,,,,,,"Acampora, C.D., On Sovereignty and Overhumanity: Why It Matters How We Read Nietzsches GMII:2.” (2004) International Studies in Philosophy, 26, pp. 201-219; Anderson, R.L., Nietzsche on Strength, Self-Knowledge, and Achieving Individuality.

The uncertainty that is created around product and project activities generates a substantial challenge for accurate software estimation. Hence, in recent years researchers have proposed various approaches that are exceptionally capable of handling uncertainty as to effort, duration and general velocity prediction based on data mining algorithms. Nevertheless, the agile state of current software project environments requires an even more sophisticated approach which is not only related to predictions but rather to prescriptive or even cognitive analytics, machine learning, scenario planning and foresight. This article aims to define a direction in which further research of applications of data mining and machine learning for software estimation may progress. This is achieved by proposing various use cases for prescriptive analytics that aim to enhance software estimation, optimize resources utilization, improve product quality and ultimately increase probability of successful project completion. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Advanced analytics; Duration estimation; Effort; Machine learning; Prescriptive analytics; Software estimation; Software maintenance; Software quality","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Computer software maintenance; Computer software selection and evaluation; Data mining; Learning systems; Software engineering; Software prototyping; Advanced analytics; Effort; Prescriptive analytics; Software estimation; Software Quality; Software design",,,,,"Trendowicz, A., (2014) Software Project Effort Estimation: Foundations and Best Practice Guidelines for Success; Selby, R.W., Software engineering: The legacy of Barry W.

Based on interviews conducted over the 2016–2017 school year with a team of data professionals employed by a Charter Management Organization (CMO) that operates one dozen schools in South and East Los Angeles, this paper shows that respondents endorse a range of views about how data can stand in for things, events, and people. Data professionals charged with the creation and management of student-level data expressed views consistent with a representationalist understanding of digital data; by contrast, those charged chiefly with aggregating and analyzing heterogeneous streams of data expressed greater skepticism toward representationalist commitments. Despite this heterogeneous set of views, all of the data professionals interviewed relied on the same medium to communicate their interpretations of data to other members of the organization, including school personnel: a bespoke platform that consists of 125 dashboards. Critically, graphical means of visualization expressed objectivity, certainty, and actuarial foresight, even in cases where data professionals expressed ambivalence about the representational power of a given source of data. © 2017 International Council for Educational Media.","Big Data; data analytics; Data visualization; Representationalism; urban education; visual analytics",,,,,,"Au, W., Meritocracy 2.0: High-stakes, standardized testing as a racial project of neoliberal multiculturalism (2016) Educational Policy, 30 (1), pp. 39-62; Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the universe halfway: Quantum physics and the entanglement of matter and meaning, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press Books; Barocas, S., Data mining and the discourse on discrimination (2014) Proceedings of the Data Ethics Workshop, Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), , https://dataethics.github.io/proceedings/DataMiningandtheDiscourseOnDiscrimination.pdf, In,.

The developed model's objective is to maximize the leader's market share while also taking into consideration the follower's response. In the classical competitive facility location model, it is assumed that the facility competes for all customers, no matter how far away they are. Instead, this paper considers a new kind of customer behavior in which people only patronize facilities within a range they feel is convenient, which is more realistic than the existing models. To solve the model, a two-stage hybrid tabu search algorithm is proposed. A set of randomly generated instances are presented and analyzed statistically in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides an effective means to solve the problems and that service distance is proved to be a significant factor in the model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-level Nonlinear Integer Programming; Competitive facility location problem; Gravity-based model; Service distance; Tabu search","Competition; Facilities; Integer programming; Location; Problem solving; Tabu search; Competitive facility location; Competitive facility location models; Customer behavior; Gravity-based models; Hybrid tabu search; Integer programming models; Non-linear integer programming; Service distance; Location based services",,,,,"Aboolian, R., Berman, O., Krass, D., Competitive facility location and design problem (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 182 (1), pp. 40-62; Ahn, H.K., Cheng, S.W., Cheong, O., Golin, M., Van Oostrum, R., Competitive facility location: The Voronoi game (2004) Theoretical Computer Science, 310 (1), pp. 457-467; Alekseeva, E., Kochetova, N., Kochetov, Y., Plyasunov, A., Heuristic and exact methods for the discrete (r|p)-centroid problem (2010) Evolutionary computation in combinatorial optimization, pp. 11-22. , Springer Berlin, Heidelberg; Ashtiani, M.G., Makui, A., Ramezanian, R., A robust model for a leader–follower competitive facility location problem in a discrete space (2013) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 37, pp. 62-71; Beresnev, V., Branch-and-bound algorithm for a competitive facility location problem (2013) Computers and Operations Research, 40 (8), pp. 2062-2070; Eiselt, H.A., Laporte, G., Sequential location problems (1997) European Journal of Operational Research, 96 (2), pp. 217-231; Fernández, J., Salhi, S., Tóth, B.G., Location equilibria for a continuous competitive facility location problem under delivered pricing (2014) Computers & Operations Research, 41, pp. 185-195; Glover, F., Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelligence (1986) Computers and Operations Research, 13 (5), pp. 533-549; Hakimi, S.L., On locating new facilities in a competitive environment (1983) European Journal of Operational Research, 12 (1), pp. 29-35; Kress, D., Pesch, E., Sequential competitive location on networks (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 217 (3), pp. 483-499; Küçükaydin, H., Aras, N., Kuban Altınel, I., Competitive facility location problem with attractiveness adjustment of the follower: A bilevel programming model and its solution (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 208 (3), pp. 206-220; Plastria, F., Static competitive facility location: An overview of optimisation approaches (2001) European Journal of Operational Research, 129 (3), pp. 461-470; Plastria, F., Vanhaverbeke, L., Discrete models for competitive location with foresight (2008) Computers and Operations Research, 35 (3), pp. 683-700; Redondo, J.L., Fernández, J., García, I., Ortigosa, P.M., Heuristics for the facility location and design (1|1)-centroid problem on the plane (2010) Computational Optimization & Applications, 45, pp. 111-141; Saidani, N., Chu, F., Chen, H., Competitive facility location and design with reactions of competitors already in the market (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 219 (1), pp. 9-17; Sáiz, M.E., Hendrix, E.M.T., Pelegrín, B., On Nash equilibria of a competitive location-design problem (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 210 (3), pp. 588-593; Shiode, S., Drezner, Z., A competitive facility location problem on a tree network with stochastic weights (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 149 (1), pp. 47-52; Shiode, S., Yeh, K., Hsia, H., Optimal location policy for three competitive facilities (2012) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 62 (3), pp. 703-707; Wang, X., Ouyang, Y., A continuum approximation approach to competitive facility location design under facility disruption risks (2013) Transportation Research: Part B: Methodological, 50, pp. 90-103","Qi, M.; Research Center on Modern Logistics, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua UniversityChina; email: qimy@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn",,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,03608352,,CINDD,,"English","Comput Ind Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018890292

Owing to the blend of material-chemistry and conventional mechanics, complex motions have been successfully generated by flexible polymeric composites that act upon external activation stimuli. However, lack of robust deterministic models which can command reliable actuator performance, hinder their widespread deployments in diverse paradigms. The present article seeks to address the argument by modelling Ionic Polymer Metal Composites (IPMC) as multi-segmented chains of connected rigid bodies. A Cyclic-Coordinate-Descent (CCD) based Inverse Kinematic solver is employed to resolve the redundancy, by minimizing an objective function in joint space at gradual iterative steps. The algorithm is validated for its ability to model dissimilarly doped polymeric curvatures bearing distinct spatial postures.

SU involves information fusion as well as model representation and inference. Commonly, heterogenous data sources must be exploited in the fusion process: often including both hard and soft data products. In a coalition context, data and processing resources will also be distributed and subjected to restrictions on information sharing. It will often be necessary for a human to be in the loop in SU processes, to provide key input and guidance, and to interpret outputs in a way that necessitates a degree of transparency in the processing: systems cannot be 'black boxes'. In this paper, we characterize the Coalition Situational Understanding (CSU) problem in terms of fusion, temporal, distributed, and human requirements. There is currently significant interest in deep learning (DL) approaches for processing both hard and soft data. We analyze the state-of-the-art in DL in relation to these requirements for CSU, and identify areas where there is currently considerable promise, and key gaps. © 2017 International Society of Information Fusion (ISIF).",,"Deep learning; Information fusion; Black boxes; Fusion process; Heterogenous data; Information sharing; Model representation; Processing resources; Soft data; State of the art; Data handling",,,,,"Dostal, B.C., Enhancing situational understanding through the employment of unmanned aerial vehicles (2007) Army Transformation Taking Shape.

However, the low-rate capability limits its range of applications. Surface modifications, for example, coating and defect engineering, play an intriguing role in interfacial electrochemical processes. Herein, a novel synthesis of highly oxygen-deficient “defective-LTO” anode material with high-rate performance is reported. It is synthesized using conventional precursors via a one-pot thermal reduction process. A high level of oxygen vacancies of ≈6.5 at% and conformal amorphous carbon coating are achieved simultaneously, resulting in a compounding effect for a high discharge capacity of 123 mAh g−1 with Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 10 C-rate. Ab initio calculations foresight that oxygen vacancies increase the electron donor density of the neighboring titanium atoms, while conformal amorphous carbon significantly lowers interfacial charge-transfer resistance. The formation mechanism, as well as the origin of enhanced electrochemical properties, is elaborated in this paper. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This can be daunting for large-scale, complex data. We introduce Foresight, a system that helps the user rapidly discover visual insights from large high-dimensional datasets. Formally, an ""insight"" is a strong manifestation of a statistical property of the data, e.g., high correlation between two attributes, high skewness or concentration about the mean of a single attribute, a strong clustering of values, and so on. For each insight type, Foresight initially presents visualizations of the top k instances in the data, based on an appropriate ranking metric. The user can then look at ""nearby"" insights by issuing ""insight queries"" containing constraints on insight strengths and data attributes. Thus the user can directly explore the space of insights, rather than the space of data dimensions and visual encodings as in other visual recommender systems. Foresight also provides ""global"" views of insight space to help orient the user and ensure a thorough exploration process. Furthermore, Foresight facilitates interactive exploration of large datasets through fast, approximate sketching. © 2017 VLDB.",,"Data dimensions; Exploration process; Exploratory data analysis; High dimensional datasets; Interactive exploration; Statistical computations; Statistical properties; Visual encodings; Encoding (symbols)",,,,,"https://www.ibm.com/analytics/watson-analytics/, Accessed: 2017-02-15; https://powerbi.microsoft.com, Accessed: 2017-02-15; Aggarwal, C.C., (2013) Outlier Analysis, , Springer; Charikar, M., Similarity estimation techniques from rounding algorithms (2002) ACM STOC, pp. 380-388; Cormode, G., Garofalakis, M.N., Haas, P.J., Jermaine, C., Synopses for massive data: Samples, histograms, wavelets, sketches (2012) Foundations and Trends in Databases Trends in Databases, 4 (1-3), pp. 1-294; Goetz, C.G., Tilley, B.C., MDS-UPDRS: Scale presentation and clinimetric testing results (2008) Movement Disorders, 23 (15), pp. 2129-2170; Nickerson, R., Confirmation bias: A ubiquitous phenomenon in many guises Review of General Psychology, 2 (2), p. 1998; Pirolli, P., Card, S., The sensemaking process and leverage points for analyst technology as identified through cognitive task analysis (2005) Procs.

According to this theory, public and private agents lack sufficient foresight to make optimal economic decisions and become poor as a result. Using a panel of U.S. state-level data, this paper offers evidence to the contrary. Public spending on education in resource-rich states greatly exceeds that in resource-scarce ones, and private education services are imperfectly crowded out as a result. Analyzing a broader set of public education outcomes reveals that relative teacher salaries, public enrollment rates, and teacher–student ratios tend to move pro-cyclically with resource booms and busts. Weaker evidence is provided that graduation rates fall in response to resource booms, perhaps reflecting a rise in the opportunity cost of going to school for working-age students. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Education attainment; Education expenditures; Natural resources; Resource curse","Compensation (personnel); Natural resources; Students; Teaching; Economic decisions; Economic prosperity; Graduation rates; Opportunity costs; Private educations; Public education; Resource curse; Resource endowments; Education; economic theory; education; educational attainment; natural resource; panel data; public spending; theoretical study; United States",,,,,"Auty, R.M., Resource-Based Industrialization: Sowing the Oil in Eight Developing Countries (1990), Clarendon Press Oxford; Bhattacharyya, S., Hodler, R., Natural resources, democracy and corruption (2010) Eur.

One overarching conclusion that stems from these studies is that organizational foresight is not developed in isolation, but evolves as an aggregation of capabilities (in the sense of the microfoundational literature) throughout the organization. In this context, some key research questions that emerge are: how does an individual develop foresight and how does it contribute to the organization? Studies concerning individual foresight are, however, quite sparse. In this paper, we take up the aforementioned first question of individual foresight development. An exploratory study involving case interviews has been used to find theoretical support for developing an individual foresight measure. © 2017 IEEE.","Capability building; Individual foresight; Information acquisition; Organizational capability","Industrial engineering; Capability building; Exploratory studies; Individual foresight; Information acquisitions; Organizational capabilities; Organizational levels; Research questions; Strategic management; Engineering",,,,,"Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17, pp. 99-120; Amit, R., Schoemaker, P.J., Strategic assets and organizational rent (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (1), pp. 33-46; Ray, G., Barney, J.B., Muhanna, W.A., Capabilities, business processes, and competitive advantage: Choosing the dependent variable in empirical tests of the resource-based view (2004) Strategic management journal, 25 (1), pp. 23-37; Dutta, S., Narasimhan, O.M., Rajiv, S., Conceptualizing and measuring capabilities: Methodology and empirical application (2005) Strategic Management Journal, 26 (3), pp. 277-285; Tsoukas, H., Shepherd, J., (2004) Managing the Future: Foresight in the Knowledge Economy, pp. 1-17. , Malden, MA: Blackwell; Baer, M., Dirks, K.T., Nickerson, J.A., Microfoundations of strategic problem formulation (2013) Strategic Management Journal, 34, pp. 197-214; Barney, J., Felin, T., What are microfoundations?

Model-based reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling an agent to learn to predict the effects of its actions, which could provide flexible predictive models for a wide range of tasks and environments, without detailed human supervision. We develop a method for combining deep action-conditioned video prediction models with model-predictive control that uses entirely unlabeled training data. Our approach does not require a calibrated camera, an instrumented training set-up, nor precise sensing and actuation. Our results show that our method enables a real robot to perform nonprehensile manipulation - pushing objects - and can handle novel objects not seen during training. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Model predictive control;

One important and challenging aspect in such collaborative foresight projects is the selection of suitable partners, which is analyzed in this paper. We do so based on existing literature and by an action research study: this collaborative foresight project was conducted by the project initiators (Linz Center of Mechatronics Ltd. (LCM) and Institute of Strategic Management, Johannes Kepler University Linz (ISM)) in cooperation with five companies. The results show that there are - due to the objectives of collaborative foresight (e.g. joint creation of future knowledge and “out-of-the-box-thinking”) - special requirements regarding technological and organizational proximity, trust and commitment. Related to technological resources we claim that a higher degree of diversity is crucial and organizational proximity is less important. In this way unique learning opportunities can be created and opportunities for new ideas can be generated. However, the companies have to be similar enough to facilitate learning and to anticipate future developments. In addition, we suppose that geographical proximity is very helpful in bringing the organizations together and facilitating the exchange of tacit knowledge. Furthermore, the results show that criteria such as trust and commitment, often referred to as key factors, are of little relevance in this context. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Collaborative foresight; Foresight; Networked foresight; Open foresight; Partner selection","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Collaborative foresight; Foresight; Networked foresight; Open foresight; Partner selection; Knowledge management; future prospect; geographical distribution; industrial development; organizational framework; partnership approach; planning method; project management; research work",,,,,"Aloini, D., Dulmin, R., Farina, G., Mininno, V., Pellegrini, L., Structured selection of partners in open innovation.

In every reappraisal period of the foresight strategies, each agent chooses only one among three predictors (naive, adaptive and VAR) to forecast the monthly inflation rate. The predictor selection process is modeled as a discrete choice dynamics based on two attributes, namely, accuracy less the average cost predictor (private attributes) and dispersion in cognitive abilities. The calibrated agent-based computational model shows that heterogeneity in inflation expectations is persistent, that is, less accurate predictors coexist with the most accurate predictor due to the dispersion in cognitive abilities of agents. © 2017, Instituto de Pesquisas Economicas da FEA-USP.

Although sub-and neofunctionalization provide clear long-term advantages, selection does not act with foresight, and unless a redundant gene copy provides an immediate fitness advantage, the copy will most likely be lost. Many models for the evolution of genes immediately following duplication have been proposed, but the robustness and applicability of these models is unclear because of the lack of data at the population level. We used qPCR, protein expression data, genome sequencing, and hybrid enrichment to test three competing models that differ in whether selection favoring the spread of duplicates acts primarily on expression level or sequence diversity for specific toxin-encoding loci in the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus). We sampled 178 individuals and identified significant inter-and intrapopulation variation in copy number, demonstrated that copy number was significantly and positively correlated with protein expression, and found little to no sequence variation across paralogs in all populations. Collectively, these results demonstrate that selection for increased expression, not sequence diversity, was the proximate evolutionary process underlying gene family origin and expansion, providing data needed to resolve the debate over which evolutionary processes govern the fates of gene copies immediately following duplication. © 2017 by the Genetics Society of America.","Copy number; Gene expression; Gene family; Selection","cytosine; DNA; guanine; snake venom; transcriptome; snake venom; adult; allele; Article; controlled study; copy number variation; Crotalus; DNA base composition; exon; female; gene duplication; gene expression; gene locus; gene sequence; genetic selection; genetic variability; genome; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; animal; copy number variation; genetics; metabolism; molecular evolution; multigene family; Animals; Crotalus; DNA Copy Number Variations; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Duplication; Multigene Family; Selection, Genetic; Snake Venoms",,"cytosine, 71-30-7; DNA, 9007-49-2; guanine, 69257-39-2, 73-40-5; snake venom, 55230-69-8; Snake Venoms",,,"Aird, S., A quantitative assessment of variation in venom constituents within and between three nominal rattlesnake subspecies (1985) Toxicon, 23, pp. 1000-1004; Aird, S., Watanabe, Y., Villar-Briones, A., Poy, M., Terada, K., Quantitative high-throughput profiling of snake venom gland transcriptomes and proteomes (Ovophis okinavensis and Protobothrops flavoviridis) (2013) BMC Genomics, 14, p. 790; Aitchison, J., (1986) The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data, , Chapman and Hall, London; Bendtsen, J.D., Nielsen, H., Von Heijne, G., Brunak, S., Improved prediction of signal peptides: SignalP 3.0 (2004) J.

The proposed framework leverages the inference channels in sensitive behavior prediction and object tracking in a video surveillance system for the sequence privacy protection. For such a goal, we need to capture different pieces of evidence which are used to infer the identity. The temporal, spatial and context features are extracted from the surveillance video as the observations to perceive the privacy demands and their correlations. Taking advantage of quantifying various evidence and utility, we let users subscribe videos with a viewer-dependent pattern. We implement a prototype system for off-line and on-line requirements in two typical monitoring scenarios to construct extensive experiments. The evaluation results show that our system can efficiently satisfy users' privacy demands while saving over 25% more video information compared to traditional video privacy protection schemes. © 2016 IEEE.","Foresight Protection; Video Privacy; Video Surveillance System","Mobile ad hoc networks; Monitoring; Sensor networks; Behavior prediction; Evaluation results; Foresight Protection; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Surveillance video; Video surveillance systems; Security systems",,,,,"Bhanu, B., Han, J., Individual recognition by kinematic-based gait analysis (2002) ICPR, 3, pp. 343-346; Bo, C., Shen, G., Liu, J., Li, X.-Y., Zhang, Y., Zhao, F., Privacy tag: Privacy concern expressed and respected (2014) SenSys, pp. 163-176. , ACM; Bobick, A.E., Johnson, A.Y., Gait recognition using static, activityspecific parameters (2001) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2001.

According to Fuller, Han and Tung (2012), all investors in a segment would gain maximum alpha from a portfolio weighted by ex post market capitalisation - in other words, a 'perfect foresight' (PF) portfolio. The PF portfolio is a buy-And-hold portfolio of all shares in a particular segment with weights at the beginning of the return period set to be proportional to the market capitalisation of the shares at the end of the return period. The excess return of the PF portfolio over the benchmark portfolio therefore is an estimate of the effect of unanticipated information on the return of the benchmark portfolio. It provides an estimate of the maximum annual amount of available alpha to all investors involved in that segment in a given year. In this study, the returns of PF portfolios were compared with the All Share, Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap segments of the JSE. Intuitively, information to guide decisions on portfolio weighting would be more valuable and deliver more profit when the cross-sectional standard deviation of share returns is high. Therefore a secondary aim was to investigate the correlation between cross-sectional standard deviation and PF excess return. It was found that a strong positive correlation (more than 90%) existed between cross-sectional standard deviation and PF excess return in all segments. In ascending order of annual PF excess return and average cross-sectional standard deviation the results for the segments were: Large Cap (8% and 29%), All Share (9% and 32%), Mid Cap (13% and 36%) and Small Cap (17% and 43%).",,,,,,,"Ankrim, E.M., Ding, Z., Cross-sectional volatility and return dispersion (2002) Financial Analysts Journal, 58 (5), pp. 67-73; Arnott, R.D., Li, F., Sherrerd, K.F., Clairvoyant value and the value effect (2009) The Journal of Portfolio Management, 35 (3), pp. 14-26; Black, F., (1986) Noise, the Journal of Finance, 61 (3), pp. 529-543; Campbell, J.Y., Kyle, A.S., Smart money, noise trading and stock price behaviour (1993) The Review of Economic Studies, 60 (1), pp. 1-34; De Long, B.J., Shleifer, A., Summers, L.H., Waldmann, R.J., Noise trader risk in financial markets (1990) Journal of Political Economy, 98 (4), pp. 703-738; Fama, E.F., Random walks in stock market prices (1965) Financial Analysts Journal, 21 (5), pp. 55-59; Fuller, R.J., Han, B., Tung, Y., Estimating the negative impact of noise on the returns of cap-weighted portfolios in various segments of the equity markets (2012) Journal of Investment Management, 10 (3), pp. 49-74; Gorman, L.R., Sapra, S.G., Weigand, R.A., The role of cross-sectional dispersion in active portfolio management (2010) Investment Management and Financial Innovations, 7 (3), p. 58; LeRoy, S.F., LaCivita, C.J., Risk aversion and the dispersion of asset prices (1981) Journal of Business, 54 (4), pp. 535-547; Lewellen, W.G., Schlarbaum, G.E., Lease, R.C., The individual investor: Attributes and attitudes (1974) The Journal of Finance, 29 (2), pp. 413-433; Raubenheimer, H., Varying cross-sectional volatility in the South African equity market and the implications for the management of fund managers (2011) South African Journal of Business Management, 42 (2), pp. 15-25; Shiller, R.J., The volatility of long-Term interest rates and expectation models of the term structure (1979) The Journal of Political Economy, 87 (6), pp. 1190-1219; Shiller, R.J., Do share prices move too much to be justified by subsequent changes in dividends?

The natural world is rife with examples of long-term 'side effects' associated with quick-fix tinkering, including blind spots in vertebrate eyes. An important question is how nature compensates for imperfections once evolution has set a course. The symbioses associated with sap-feeding insects present a fascinating opportunity to address this issue. On one hand, the substantial diversity and biomass of sap-feeding insects are largely due to ancient acquisitions of nutrient-provisioning bacterial symbionts. Yet, the insularity and small population sizes enforced by intracellular life and strict maternal transfer inevitably result in the degradation of symbiont genomes and, often, the beneficial services that symbionts provide. Stabilization through lateral transfer of bacterial genes into the host nucleus (often from exogenous sources) or replacement of the long-standing symbiont with a new partner are potential solutions to this evolutionary dilemma (Bennett & Moran ). A third solution is adoption of a cosymbiont that compensates for specific losses in the original resident. Ancient 'co-obligate' symbiont pairs in mealybugs, leafhoppers, cicadas and spittlebugs show colocalization, codiversification, metabolite exchange and generally nonredundant nutrient biosynthesis (Bennett & Moran ). But in this issue, Meseguer et al.

On the one hand, the degree of uncertainty is associated with the objective essence of randomness of the phenomenon, and on the other, with the subjective perspective of a man. Future-oriented perception of human activities is laden with an incomplete specificity of the analysed phenomena, their volatility, and lack of continuity. A man is unable to determine, with complete certainty, the further course of these phenomena. According to the author of this article, in order to significantly reduce the uncertainty while making strategic decisions in a complex environment, we should focus our actions on the future through systemic research of foresight. This article attempts to answer the following research questions: 1) What is the relationship between foresight studies in the system perspective to studies of the uncertainty? 2) What classes of foresight methods enable the research of uncertainty in the process of system inquiry of the future? This study conducted deductive reasoning based on the results of the analysis methods and criticism of literature. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

Here we report isolation, genome sequencing and metabolic profiling of new strain Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 isolated from marine sediment sample collected in the Trondheim Fjord, Norway. The 16S rRNA and multilocus phylogenetic analysis showed that MP131-18 belongs to the genus Streptomyces. The genome of MP131-18 isolate was sequenced, and 36 gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of 18 different types of secondary metabolites were predicted using antiSMASH analysis. The combined genomics-metabolics profiling of the strain led to the identification of several new biologically active compounds. As a result, the family of bisindole pyrroles spiroindimicins was extended with two new members, spiroindimicins E and F. Furthermore, prediction of the biosynthetic pathway for unusual α-pyrone lagunapyrone isolated from MP131-18 resulted in foresight and identification of two new compounds of this family - lagunapyrones D and E. The diversity of identified and predicted compounds from Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 demonstrates that marine-derived actinomycetes are not only a promising source of new natural products, but also represent a valuable pool of genes for combinatorial biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"antiinfective agent; biological product; indole; indole derivative; pyrrole derivative; aquatic species; bacterial genome; biosynthesis; chemistry; genetics; genomics; metabolism; metabolomics; molecular genetics; multigene family; phylogeny; secondary metabolism; Streptomyces; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Aquatic Organisms; Biological Products; Biosynthetic Pathways; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Indoles; Metabolomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Pyrroles; Secondary Metabolism; Streptomyces",,"indole, 120-72-9; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Biological Products; indole; Indoles; Pyrroles",,,"Thabit, A.K., Crandon, J.L., Nicolau, D.P., Antimicrobial resistance: Impact on clinical and economic outcomes and the need for new antimicrobials (2015) Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy, 16, pp. 159-177; Solomon, S.L., Oliver, K.B., Antibiotic resistance threats in the United States: Stepping back from the brink (2014) American Family Physician, 89, pp. 938-941; Berdy, J., Thoughts and facts about antibiotics: Where we are now and where we are heading (2012) Journal of Antibiotics, 65, pp. 385-395; Solecka, J., Zajko, J., Postek, M., Rajnisz, A., Biologically active secondary metabolites from Actinomycetes (2012) Central European Journal of Biology, 7, pp. 373-390; Monciardini, P., Iorio, M., Maffioli, S., Sosio, M., Donadio, S., Discovering new bioactive molecules from microbial sources (2014) Microbial Biotechnology, 7, pp. 209-220; Hu, G.P., Statistical research on marine natural products based on data obtained between 1985 and 2008 (2011) Marine Drugs, 9, pp. 514-525; Valli, S., Antimicrobial potential of Actinomycetes species isolated from marine environment (2012) Asian Pac J Trop Biomed, 2, pp. 469-473; Valliappan, K., Sun, W., Li, Z.Y., Marine actinobacteria associated with marine organisms and their potentials in producing pharmaceutical natural products (2014) Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 98, pp. 7365-7377; Charan, R.D., Diazepinomicin, a new antimicrobial alkaloid from a marine Micromonospora sp (2004) Journal of Natural Products, 67, pp. 1431-1433; Mason, W.P., A phase II study of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway inhibitor TLN-4601 in patients with glioblastoma at first progression (2012) Journal of Neuro-Oncology, 107, pp. 343-349; Gulder, T.A., Moore, B.S., Salinosporamide natural products: Potent 20 S proteasome inhibitors as promising cancer chemotherapeutics (2010) Angew Chem Int Ed Engl, 49, pp. 9346-9367; Bentley, S.D., Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (2002) Nature, 417, pp. 141-147; Omura, S., Genome sequence of an industrial microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis: Deducing the ability of producing secondary metabolites (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 98, pp. 12215-12220; Rebets, Y., Brotz, E., Tokovenko, B., Luzhetskyy, A., Actinomycetes biosynthetic potential: How to bridge in silico and in vivo?

However, the process of predicting link quality (LQ) is nontrivial due to the streaming and dynamic nature of radio wave propagation, which is complicated by robot mobility. Due to robot movement, the wireless propagation environment can change considerably in terms of distance, obstacles, noise, and interference. Therefore, LQ must be learned and regularly updated while the robot is online. However, the existing fuzzy-based models for assessing LQ are non-adaptable due to the absence of any learning mechanism. To address this issue, we introduce a fuzzy-based prediction model designed for the efficient online and incremental learning of LQ. The unique approach uses fuzzy logic to infer LQ based on the collective output from a series of offset classifiers and their posterior probabilities. In essence, the proposed model leverages machine learning for extracting the underlying functional relationship between the input and output variables, but deeper inferences are made from the output of the learning algorithms using fuzzy logic. Wireless link data from a real-world robot network was used to compare the model with the traditional linear regression approach. The results show statistically significant improvements in three out of the six real-world indoor and outdoor environments where the robot operated. Additionally, the novel approach offers a number of other benefits, including the flexibility to use fuzzy logic for model tuning, as well as the ability to make implementation efficiencies in terms of parallelization and the conservation of labeling resources. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Radio waves; Robot programming; Robots; Wave propagation; Functional relationship; Fuzzy-based models; Incremental learning; Learning mechanism; Machine learning models; Outdoor environment; Posterior probability; Wireless propagation; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"Nguyen, H.G., Pezeshkian, N., Hart, A., Burmeister, A., Holz, K., Neff, J., Evolution of a radio communication relay system (2013) Proc.

Some case studies suggest war torn, fragile, and corrupt countries experience K&R epidemics more often. While such factors may be present in some countries experiencing K&R epidemics, it remains to be seen if these failed state factors are generalizable to all nations. To date, no research has systematically examined the conditions that might facilitate K&R epidemics. This study used a case-control design comparing countries with high rates of K&R (experimental) to countries without a K&R problem (control). Findings suggest that problem K&R countries were less secure, less peaceful, and unevenly developed in relation to social and economic indicators. Better understanding of the conditions involving K&R problems offers to improve foresight and the development of effective policy responses. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Callimachi, R., Paying Ransoms, Europe Bankrolls Qaeda Terror (2014) The New York Times, 29. , http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/ransoming-citizens-europebecomes-al-qaedas-patron.html?_rD0, (accessed 1 September 2015); Multiple Kidnappings for Ransom Funding ISIS, Source says,’” (2014) CBS, , http://www.cbsnews.com/news/multiple-kidnappings-for-ransom-funding-isis-sourcesays/; Thomas, T.S., Kiser, S.D., Casebeer, W.D., (2005) Warlords Rising: Confronting Violent Non-State Actors, , Lanham, MD: Lexington Books; Phillips, E., (2009) The Business of Kidnap for Ransom, the Faces of Terrorism: Multidisciplinary Perspectives, pp. 189-207. , West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell; Moor, M., Remijnse, S., Kidnapping is a Booming Business, , IKV PAX Christi (2008); (1978), Richard Clutterbuck, Kidnap and Ransom: The Response (London: Faber; Stubbert, C.H., Pires, S.F., Guerette, R.T., Crime Science and Crime Epidemics in Developing Countries: A Reflection on Kidnapping for Ransom in Colombia, South America (2015) Crime Science, 4 (1), pp. 1-11; Marongiu, P., Clarke, R.V., Ransom Kidnapping in Sardinia, Subcultural Theory and Rational Choice (1993) Routine Activity and Rational Choice: Advances in Criminological Theory, pp. 179-200. , Ronald V.

Thefindings suggest that the employment of intuition in dynamic settings is indeed common but, contraryto previous beliefs, it is much more nuanced. Not only do various professional groups utilize differentkinds of intuition, they also adjust its use to the specific type of activity. A distinction has been detectedin particular between approaches to task-related versus people-related activities. The understandingwhich organizational player and under which conditions relies on intuition, provides new insights intoknowledge generation in modern organizations. © 2017 by IGI Global.

A number of cognitive modeling features, imposing restriction on the modeling technology and the corresponding computational experiment, are noted. A number of research results on the interrelation of the educational system and society are demonstrated through the developed cognitive model. These results allow using the model to trace, comprehend and evaluate the consequences of possible changes in the society under the influence of both external disturbing effects and administrative decisions (for example, in the form of reforms, strategic directions of innovative educational policy, etc.).

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors classify wildcards into three particular types which share similar character: natural wildcards, artificial wildcards (Degree 1) and artificial wildcards (Degree 2). Wildcards point to unexpected and surprising events including important results that can form watershed in the development of a specific trend. In addition, the authors present a Fuzzy TOPSIS model which can be used in various cases to prioritize a number of weak signals and put them in order, so that the most important ones are likely to yield the wildcard in the future Findings: The authors presented a classification of wildcards with the same characteristics being natural wildcards, artificial wildcards (Degree 1) and artificial wildcards (Degree 2). The authors also prioritized the weak signals to deal with the most important ones and take appropriate action in advance so as to minimize possible damages and maximize the benefits of potential wildcards in an uncertain environment. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors report on the prioritizing of weak signals by applying Fuzzy TOPSIS and classify wildcards. This is significant because, by identifying the most important weak signals, appropriate actions can be taken in the future if necessary. The paper should be of interest to readers in the area of participatory foresight. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental scanning; Futurist; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Panel of experts; Weak signals; Wildcards",,,,,,"Ansoff, I., (1982) Strategic response to turbulent environments, , Working Paper 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, Brussels; Choo, C.W., Auster, E., Environmental scanning: acquisition and use of information by managers (1993) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 28, pp. 279-314; Coffman, B., (1997) Weak signal research, part IV: evolution and growth of the weak signal to maturity, , www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrmatur.htm; Conway, M., (2010) Environmental Scanning: What Is it, How to Do It, , April., Thinking Futures; Cornish, E., The wild cards in our future (2003) The Futurist, 37 (4), p. 18; Hiltunen, E., Was it a wild card or just our blindness to gradual change (2006) Journal of Futures Studies, 11 (2), pp. 61-74; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Hiltunen, E., (2013) Foresight and Innovation: How Companies Are Coping with the Future, , Springer, Berlin; Huang, I.B., Keisler, J., Linkov, I., Multi-criteria decision analysis in environmental sciences: ten years of applications and trends (2011) Science of the Total Environment, 409 (19), pp. 3578-3594; Hwang, C.-L., Lai, Y.J., Liu, T.Y., A new approach for multiple objective decision making (1993) Computers & Operations Research, 20 (8), pp. 889-899; Hwang, C.L., Yoon, K., (2012) Multiple Attribute Decision Making: Methods and Applications a State-of-the-Art Survey, 186. , Springer Science & Business Media; Kuo, M.S., Tzeng, G.H., Huang, W.C., Group decision-making based on concepts of ideal and anti-ideal points in a fuzzy environment (2007) Mathematical and Computer Modeling, 45 (3), pp. 324-339; Lesca, H., Lesca, N., (2013) Weak Signals for Strategic Intelligence: Anticipation Tool for Managers, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; Lesca, H., Lesca, N., The subject within the field of management science: concepts and issues (2014) Strategic Decisions and Weak Signals, pp. 1-46; Mannermaa, M., (1999) Tulevaisuuden hallinta-skenaariot strategiatyöskentelyssä, , WSOY; Mendonça, S., e Cunha, M.P., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., Wild cards, weak signals and organisational improvisation (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 201-218; Mitroff, I.I., Crisis management-cutting through the confusion (1988) Sloan Management Review, 29 (2), pp. 15-20; Moayeri, M., Shahvarani, A., Behzadi, M.H., Hosseinzadeh-Lotfi, F., Comparison of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods for math teachers selection (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (13); Moijanen, M., Heikot Signaalit Tulevaisuudentutkimuksessa (2003) Futura, 22 (4); Molitor, G.T., Molitor forecasting model: key dimensions for plotting the’patterns of change’ (2003) Journal of Future Studies, 8 (1), pp. 61-72; Nikander, I.O., Early warnings (2002) A Phenomenon in Project Management, , Helsinki University of Technology; Petersen, J.L., (1999) Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises, , National Book Network; Rockfellow, J.D., Wild cards: preparing for ‘the big one’ (1994) The Futurist, 28 (1), p. 14; Yeh, C.H., Deng, H., Pan, H., Multi-criteria analysis for dredger dispatching under uncertainty (1999) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 50 (1), pp. 35-43; Yeh, C.H., Deng, H., Chang, Y.H., Fuzzy multicriteria analysis for performance evaluation of bus companies (2000) European Journal of Operational Research, 126 (3), pp. 459-473; Yoon, K., A reconciliation among discrete compromise solutions (1987) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 38 (3), pp. 277-286; Yoon, K.P., Hwang, C.L., (1995) Multiple Attribute Decision Making: An Introduction, 104. , Sage Publications, London; Zadeh, L.A., The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning-III (1975) Information Sciences, 9 (1), pp. 43-80; Zavadskas, E.K., Zakarevicius, A., Antucheviciene, J., Evaluation of ranking accuracy in multi-criteria decisions (2006) Informatica, 17 (4), pp. 601-618; Coffman, B.S., (1997) Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution, , www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, MG Taylor Corporation","Mohammadi, M.; Futures Studies Research Center, Imam Khomeini International UniversityIran; email: mohammadi.m.982@gmail.com",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014817004

Therefore, any country connected to free waters requires foresight regarding retrofit of offshore ship and structures. Although, designing a structure based on explosive loads is not affordable, investigating the waves caused by explosion and their destructive effects could take into account some considerations in locating and constructing of these structures, so that, the minimum destruction would occur. Given the necessity of this issue and what mentioned above, the results of evaluating dynamic behavior of honeycomb sandwich structures under underwater explosion can be examined using finite element method and simulating the explosion environment. In this regard, this study has modeled and monitored 5 samples of honeycomb structures with different cores by simulating them to evaluate the dynamic behavior in underwater explosion condition using explicit dynamic. The results indicated that ductility against underwater explosive load depends on the structure core for honeycomb sandwich structures and this is frequently shown in figures, deformations and contours. Also, the results indicated that a honeycomb structure with diagonal and discrete core has the minimum and maximum deflection equal to 6.2 and 19 cm, respectively. Other samples including square, circular and hexagonal core has 41, 20 and 23% less deformation than the discrete sample. In other words, diagonal sandwich structures are more resistant against the waves caused by underwater explosion and show a more optimal behavior. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Explosive load; Finite element method; Gas bubble; Samples; Sandwich structures; Underwater explosion",,,,,,"(1989) Shock tests, high impact shipboard machinery, equipment and systems, Requirements, , Naval Publications and Forms Center, Philadelphia; Aruk, F., (2008) Finite element analysis of response of a floating structure to an underwater explosion, , MSc Thesis, Istanbul Technical University, Sariyer, Turkey; Cole, R.H., (1948) Underwater Explosions, p. 437. , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA; Gupta, N.K., Kumar, P., Hegde, S., On deformation and tearing of stiffened and un-stiffened square plates subjected to underwater explosion a numerical study (2010) Intl.

Progress was slow until 1905, when Einstein explained the newly observed photoelectric effect in metals and Planck solved the blackbody emission puzzle by introducing the quanta hypothesis. Applications and new devices soon flourished, pushed by the dawning technology of vacuum tube sensors developed in the 1920s and 1930s culminating in the advent of television. Zworykin and Morton, the celebrated fathers of videonics, on the last page of their legendary book Television (1939) concluded that “when rockets will fly to the moon and to other celestial bodies, the first images we will see of them will be those taken by camera tubes, which will open to mankind new horizons.” Their foresight became a reality with the Apollo and Explorer missions. Photolithography enabled the fabrication of silicon monolithic imaging focal planes for the visible spectrum beginning in the early 1960s. Some of these early developments were intended for a picture phone, other efforts were for television cameras, satellite surveillance, and digital imaging. Infrared (IR) imaging has been vigorously pursed in parallel with visible imaging because of its utility in military applications. More recently (1997), the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera aboard the Hubble space telescope delivered a deep-space picture, a result of 10 days integration, featuring galaxies of the 30th magnitude-an unimaginable figure even for astronomers of our generation. Probably, the 66next effort will be in the big-band age. Thus, photodetectors continue to open to mankind the most amazing new horizons. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Cameras; Charge coupled devices; Electron tubes; Military applications; Photodetectors; Photoelectricity; Photons; Rockets; Satellites; Security systems; Blackbody emission; Celestial bodies; Digital imaging; Explorer missions; Hubble space telescopes; Optical radiations; Visible imaging; Visible spectra; Television applications",,,,,"Donati, S., (1999) Photodetectors.

Material and method: Thirty four CHB and 25 CHC patient samples were taken before and after the treatment and stored appropriately. CHB patients were treated with LAM and CHC patients were treated with using the combination of PEG INF 2a and RIB. HBV DNA, anti HBe, ALT, AST and TNF alpha results were obtained from CHB patients before and 48th week of the treatment. HCV RNA, ALT, AST and TNF alpha results were also obtained from CHC patients before and in the 6th month of completing the treatment. Responses to the treatment were taken as negative result of HBV DNA in CHB patients after finishing the treatment and as negative result of HCV RNA in CHC patients after 6 months of finishing the 48 weeks of PEG INF treatment. Results: At the level of decreasing TNF-alpha in CHB patients when the group responding to the treatment compared to the group not responding to the treatment, a significant difference was observed in favor of the respondent group (p&lt;0.0001). At the level of decreasing TNF-alpha in CHC patients when the group responding to the treatment compared to the group not responding to the treatment, a significant difference was also obtained in favor of the respondent group (p&lt;0.0001). In the analysis for emphasizing the importance of TNF alpha level in response to the treatment in CHB patients, it was found that predicting the response to the treatment of TNF alpha was 78.6% sensitivity and 75% specificity for 68.78 cutoff. In the analysis for emphasizing the importance of TNF alpha level in response to the treatment in CHC patients, it was found that determining the response of TNF alpha to the treatment was 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for 122.4 cutoff. Conclusions: With the treatment a decrease in TNF alpha is occured in CHB and CHC patients; however, TNF alpha decrease in the groups responding to the treatment is more significant. The results of this research show that TNF alpha level may be an important non-invasive marker for foresight and determining the response to the treatment. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) is a microcosm of the Singapore brand of government. The DNA of Singapore's policymaking is its forward-looking nature. S. Rajaratnam's trademark is taking the long view while Lee Kuan Yew articulated his wish for leadership foresight and the admiration for 'helicopter quality' candidates in policymaking. This was how RSIS' mission began under the stewardship of the late President S. R. Nathan. RSIS began (as IDSS - i.e., the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies) in 1996 as a form of policymakers' clairvoyant on security matters. To date, it is Singapore's 'frontline' think tank on Asia-Pacific security, counter-terrorism, inter-religious dialogue and non-traditional security threats. The contributors in this edited volume, Forward Engagement: RSIS as a Think Tank of International Studies and Security in the Asia-Pacific, are the stalwarts of the RSIS mission for the past 20 years and the leading lights for the RSIS of the 21st century. These are their reflections for posterity as well as their forward projections for their quasi-diplomatic and intellectual roles in the service of Singapore's national security. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

We identify three types of institutional work. The first is identity work in which ITRI engaged in defining the problem, developing an agenda, and restructuring organization positions. The second is professional work in which ITRI networked with professional communities, promoted foresights, and cultivated blueprints. The third type of institutional work is discourse work in which ITRI developed motivating stories, tropes, and pedagogies to promote service innovation. © 2016, College of Management Press.

Given such a fierce, competitive marketplace, it is wise, if not imperative, to evaluate these fans and their draft systems to optimize operating efficiency to save input horsepower, and, in turn, consumed electrical power. These power-reducing upgrades can also substantially reduce emissions and the overall carbon footprint of the process. An opportunity arose at a cement plant whereas the rotor of one of the preheater ID fans was becoming a maintenance issue and reaching the end of its operational life. The foresight of plant personnel reasoned that if it had to be replaced, an upgrade of the rotor should be considered, particularly considering the fact that their electricity provider was offering rebates for power savings. This paper presents a case histor including all the challenges along the way to replace the original, antiquated radial blade rotor design with a more efficient, properly selected and modern backward curved design. The result of this commitment to modermization dramatically lowered the input electrical requirements creating considerable operational savings with an attractive rate on the return of investment. © 2016 IEEE.","backward curved; buildup; cement; efficiency; fans; horsepower; induced draft; mechanical draft; optimize; payback; power savings; preheater; radial; return on investment; right-sizing; upgrade","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Cement plants; Cements; Efficiency; Emission control; Fans; Investments; backward curved; buildup; horsepower; Induced drafts; mechanical draft; optimize; payback; Power savings; Pre-heater; radial; Re-turn-on; right-sizing; upgrade; Cement industry",,,,,"US Energy Information Administration; Data for Regional Electrical Rates, , www.eia.com; ANSI | AMCA - Air Movement and Control Association Standard 210-07 | ANSI | ASHRAE 51-07: Laboratory Methods of Testing Fans for Certified Aerodynamic Performance Rating; Definition and Equation of Fan Static Efficiency; Outlet Duct Test Apparatus; CIMTEC, Inc. - Glen Corley; Field Test Data for before and after Fan Equipment Upgrade 4, , Mitsubishi Cement - Lucerne Valley, CA; data trends and operational results; Johnson, J., ProcessBarron; Narrative and illustrative plots from ANSYS CFX for Computational Fluid Dynamic Analysis of Particle Tracking; Northrup, P., ProcessBarron; Graphic Development of Illustrations 7, , Brianna Basik - ProcessBarron ; formatting and copy set",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 IEEE-IAS/PCA Cement Industry Technical Conference, IAS/PCA 2016","15 May 2016 through 19 May 2016",,124880,07314906,9781467386197,ICIPD,,"English","IEEE Cem Ind Tech Conf Pap",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000443107

Their preferred stories of the future involve an open and global environment, broad and diversified friendship, leisure and travel over work, family and relationships, and most importantly, a multicultural and sharing world.

But it also has an undeniable prophetic character. And this not only in a sense of a possible ""predictions"" of future events, but in the most part also in deeper foresights of reality which are not discovered and expressed by others. Mardešić reaches the essential problems of the contemporary world in its spiritual state of mind. Today's man is exposed in it to numerous splits, self-deceptions, illusions and false appearances; he is able to lie to himself and to others, to be true or alienated, just to appear or to really be. This can grow even to collective dimensions. Some Mardešić's projections about Church and Christianism witness of interconnection of their spiritual and scientific aspects. According to Mardešić, the Church should be a Church of poor and neglected, of deep humanness, of hope and joy, of reconciliation and forgiving and of sincere dialogue with the contemporary world. Mardešić is also deeply committed to an entirely personalistic Christianism, outside of any collectivistic and ideological visions, to cessation of its linking with politics, which led in the past to worst deformations, and to trust in freedom and in free man. The world can change only if we change ourselves first. The Christianism of future must find again its original ""human face"", which is nothing else than the divine-humain face of Jesus Christ.","Christianism with a human face; Distortions of consciousness; Prophetic spirit; The future of Church and Christianism; Željko Mardešić",,,,,,"Mardešić, Z., Politički dualizam i koncilsko kršćanstvo (2003) Nova Prisutnost, 1 (1), pp. 5-27. , 6; Mardešić, Z., (1997) Lica i Maske Svetoga.

Thus, albeit PPBS-based defense plans were developed in the Hungarian Ministry of Defense (Hungarian MoD) regularly, they lacked both an expression of clear priorities and strategic focus.

In addition, Hungary abolished conscription in 2004 and began to develop fully professional armed forces, and finally had to adapt to the austerity measures after the financial crisis of 2008. In the meantime, the number of troops of the HDF has decreased from 100,000 to 30,000, and Hungary has been stationing 800-1000 troops all the time for the last 15 years in crisis management operations (mostly on the Balkans, in Iraq and in Afghanistan), which had not been pursued before; Young, T.-D., Capabilities-Based Defense Planning: Techniques Applicable to NATO and PfP Countries (2006) Connections, 5 (1), 37p; Dunay, P., The Half-Hearted Transformation of the Hungarian Military (1986) European Security, 14 (1), 21p; Dunay, P., The Half-Hearted Transformation of the Hungarian Military (1986) European Security, 14 (1), 21p; Ruzsás, L., András, D., ‘A Honvédelmi Tárca új Védelmi Tervez (2005) Tanulmánygyűjtemény: Válogatás a Honvédelmi Minisztérium 2004, pp. 9-28. , évi kutatási eredményeit összegező tanulmányokból, pályázatokból, ed.

In the Hungarian context, no apparatus to co-ordinate the defencerelated questions exists.

Such studies assume that leave intent serves equally well as both a proxy for and predictor of employees’ actual turnover behavior. The purpose of this study is to provide an agency-level evaluation of the usefulness of turnover intention as a reliable proxy and predictor of actual turnover across 180 U.S. federal agencies, using hierarchical (stepwise) multiple regression. Our findings suggest that, at the organizational level, turnover intention and actual turnover are distinct concepts, predicted by different sets of variables. Based on these findings, we conclude that public managers tasked with retention might have better foresight concentrating on their agencies’ unique demographic characteristics and specific management practices, rather than on their employees’ self-reported aggregated turnover intention rate. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","federal government; human resource management; turnover",,,,,,"Anderson, R.A., Corazzini, K.N., McDaniel, R.R., Complexity science and the dynamics of climate and communication: Reducing nursing home turnover (2004) The Gerontologist, 44, pp. 378-388; Bae, K.B., Goodman, D., The influence of family-friendly policies on turnover and performance in South Korea (2014) Public Personnel Management, 43, pp. 520-542; Banaszak-Holl, J., Hines, M.A., Factors associated with nursing home staff turnover (1996) The Gerontologist, 36, pp. 512-517; Baruch, Y., Nicholson, N., Home, sweet work: Requirements for effective home working (1997) Journal of General Management, 23, pp. 15-30; Belanger, F., Collins, R.W., Distributed work arrangements: A research framework (1998) The Information Society, 14, pp. 137-152; Bennett, N., Blum, T.C., Long, R.G., Roman, P.M., A firm-level analysis of employee attrition (1993) Group & Organization Management, 18, pp. 482-499; Bertelli, A.M., Determinants of bureaucratic turnover intention: Evidence from the Department of the Treasury (2007) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 17, pp. 235-258; Blau, F.D., Kahn, L.M., Race and sex differences in quits by young workers (1981) Industrial & Labor Relations Review, 34, pp. 563-577; Boe, E.E., Bobbitt, S.A., Cook, L.H., Whither didst thou go?

Prior studies to characterize IPMCs have been conducted over several years but efforts on its kinematic modeling have remained inchoate. The bending profile of IPMC changes when placed in different ionic solutions. The IPMC trace along with its tip location characterizes its complete behavior upon low level actuation. This article aims at identifying the bending patterns of an IPMC actuator, decomposing it as a 20-link hyper-redundant serial manipulator. The Tractrix based inverse kinematics engine is used to study the polymer profile in distilled water, 1.5 N LiCl and NaCl solutions respectively. The proposed algorithm yields a natural curve (Tractrix) which resembles the profile traced by an actuated IPMC strip - enabling its use in potential applications which would require a foresight of the actuator workspace. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Hyper redundant manipulator; Inverse kinematics; IPMC; Tractrix","Actuators; Functional polymers; Industrial manipulators; Inverse kinematics; Manipulators; Metal drawing; Redundant manipulators; Hyper-redundant kinematics; Hyper-redundant manipulator; Ionic polymer metal composites; IPMC; Research interests; Serial manipulators; Tractrix; Wide-ranging applications; Kinematics",,,,,"Bhandari, B., Lee, G.-Y., Ahn, S.-H., A review on IPMC material as actuators and sensors: Fabrications, characteristics and applications (2012) Int.

We adopt a case-based approach involving three software firms, whose innovation teams served as our empirical research sites. Our study highlights the triadic influence of individual, organisational and contextual organising practises on the cultivation of strategic foresight. We identify four relational assemblages of practises that enable (or impede) the enactment of strategic foresight in practise. These include strategic conversations, perspective taking and reflexivity-in-practise, over-emphasis on formal knowledge and technical rationality, and benevolent conspiracies. We add to research on strategic foresight by extending our understanding of the vital role that lower-level employees may play in the cultivation of organisational 'foresightfulness'. We therefore urge management advisors to accord lower-level input recognizably respectful consideration, if not adoption. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Innovation teams; Organizing architecture; Relationalism; Strategic foresight",,,,,,"Ahuja, G., Coff, R.W., Lee, P.M., Managerial foresight and attempted rent appropriation: Insider trading on knowledge of imminent breakthroughs (2005) Strategic Management Journal, 26, pp. 791-808; Alvesson, M., Beyond neopositivists, romantics and localists: A reflexive approach to interviews in organisational research (2003) Academy of Management Review, 28, pp. 13-33; Andriopoulos, C., Gotsi, M., Probing the future: Mobilising foresight in multiple-product innovation firms (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 50-66; Baldwin, C.Y., Hiernerth, C., Von Hippel, E., How User Innovations Become Commercial Products: A Theoretical Investigation and Case Study (2006) Research Policy, 25, pp. 1291-1313; Bandura, A., Self efficacy (1994) Encyclopaedia of human behaviour, 4, pp. 71-81. , Academic Press, New York, V.

Clinical rating scales may be unable to offer precise measurement of gait dysfunction in Friedreich's ataxia compared to wearable body and inertial sensors. Using wireless inertial sensors mounted about the ankle joint of a person with Friedreich's ataxia, the accelerometer and gyroscope signal recordings can be wirelessly transmitted to a cloud computing resource for postprocessing, such as the development of a machine learning feature set. Machine learning can be applied to distinguish between the gait features of a person with Friedreich's ataxia and a person with healthy gait characteristics as a comparator through the application of a multilayer perceptron neural network. A considerable degree of classification accuracy for distinguishing between the gait feature set for the person with Friedreich's ataxia and healthy subject was achieved. The synthesis of wearable and wireless inertial body sensors with machine learning may offer the potential to enhance clinical diagnostic acuity and conceivably prognostic foresight. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Body sensor networks; Gait analysis; Inertial navigation systems; Learning systems; Neurodegenerative diseases; Wearable technology; Classification accuracy; Clinical diagnostics; Friedreich's ataxias; Healthy subjects; Machine learning classification; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Neurological disorders; Precise measurements; Wearable sensors",,,,,"LeMoyne, R., Mastroianni, T., Use of smartphones and portable media devices for quantifying human movement characteristics of gait, tendon reflex response, and Parkinson's disease hand tremor (2015) Mobile Health Technologies: Methods and Protocols, pp. 335-358. , A.

The modern approach of predicting the future of technology, taking into account the multidimensionality of the environment, is, among other things, the Future-Oriented Technology Analysis (FTA). Designing the FTA research procedure is a complex process, both in organizational and methodological terms. The catalogue of methods that can be used in this process is extensive and constantly open. However, in the source literature the rules for the selection of methods appropriate for the type of research were not specified. The ways of combining methods in the research process were also missing. The main aim of this article was to present the author’s classification of methods of future-oriented technology analysis and indicate the possibilities of its application. In the text, using statistical methods and artificial neural networks, the classification of methods with the potential of exploitation in prospective technology analysis was carried out. Each of the received classes was analysed, the characteristics of particular groups of methods were selected, and authorial names characterizing the given classes were chosen. According to the author, the application of the proposed classification of methods of future-oriented technology analysis facilitates the design of the FTA research process. It will contribute to the systematization and standardization of the manner of selection of research methods.

Whilst initially predictions were that the platform would lead to disintermediation, after the first decade, a new type of intermediary appeared that represented a new value proposition to end users and substantially reduced the marketing power of hotel companies. We will analyse this evolution as a ‘two-sided market’ phenomenon. The understanding of how the Internet environment affects business models will then be used to elaborate plausible scenarios for the future of hotel distribution following the Framework Foresight method.

We show that this happens if and only if switching costs are not too large. We present the only treatment up to date of how switching costs (and only switching costs) affect competition based on the assumption that switching costs differ across consumers, which allows us to illustrate the undesired byproduct of assuming that products exhibit substantial horizontal differentiation. Not only do we draw implications for the classical literature on competition with switching costs, but also for the more recent one that rests upon such an assumption too. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We show how to empirically identify the relative weight of news and noise shocks to government spending and compute the level of noise for Canada, the UK and the US. We then investigate the quantitative implications of imperfect fiscal policy information using a medium-scale DSGE model. We find that when the government seeks to implement a persistent change in expected public spending, the existence of noise (as estimated using actual data) implies a sizable difference in fiscal multipliers compared to the perfect fiscal foresight case. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","DSGE models; Government spending; Noisy information","economic policy; fiscal policy; government; macroeconomics; public spending; Canada; United Kingdom; United States",,,,,"Barsky, R.B., Sims, E.R., Information, animal spirits, and the meaning of innovations in consumer confidence (2012) Am.

EES is especially developed for the project ""Engaging Encounters: sketching futures together"", during which I explore with 100 inspirators all over the world potential futures. The studio is based on the principle of participatory sensemaking grounded in embodied and situated interactions in a shared action space. The studio offers a stage for interaction, several tools to spark the encounters and recording devices to capture the encounters for data analysis.

That is logical reason why they introduce the concept of symbiotic innovation to innovation management literature. In this chapter, authors elaborate open innovations as effi - ciency drivers in evolutionary economic processes (Section 2). In Section 3, authors introduce the open innovation paradigm and key concepts of futures-oriented open innovation management. In Section 4, authors present a scientifi c discussion about systemic change and the critical role of individuals in innovation management. Authors pay special attention on the difference between open and closed innovation process from an individual's point of view. In Section 5, authors introduce the Quartet Helix Model (as additional model to Triple Helix Model) and an analysis of new dynamics of open innovation processes. In Section 6, authors elaborate and discuss open innovation management roadmaps to the future. Section 7 provides elaborations of alternative innovation models for private enterprises, with special attention to foresight-innovation linkages. In Section 8, authors analyse links between radical innovation management and OP paradigm. Section 9 provides summary of key insights and results. © 2016 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

This benchmark problem admits exact analytical solutions for the spatially dependent temperature distributions within the rod and the surrounding coolant. The adjoint sensitivity analysis methodology (ASAM) is applied to compute the analytical expressions of the adjoint state functions for this benchmark problem. In turn, these adjoint state functions are used to compute exactly the first-order sensitivities of the various temperature distributions to the benchmark's thermal-hydraulics parameters. Locations of particular importance are those where the rod, the rod surface, and the coolant temperatures attain their maxima. The analytical expressions of the benchmark sensitivities thus obtained are subsequently used to compute numerical values of the sensitivities of the various temperature distributions that would arise in the preliminary design of the G4M Reactor to thermal-hydraulics parameters characteristic of this reactor. The exact benchmark sensitivities are used for verifying the numerical results produced by the FLUENT Adjoint Solver, a code that has been used for computing thermal-hydraulics processes within the G4M Reactor. This solution verification process indicates that the current FLUENT Adjoint Solver cannot compute any sensitivities for the temperature distribution within the solid rod. However, the FLUENT Adjoint Solver is capable of computing the sensitivities of fluid temperatures to boundary parameters (e.g., boundary temperature, boundary velocity, and boundary pressure), but yields accurate results only for the sensitivities of the fluid outlet temperature and the maximum rod surface temperature to the inlet temperature and inlet velocity, respectively. Even for these sensitivities, the FLUENT Adjoint Solver typically needed over 20 000 iterations to converge to the correct solution. In fact, if the exact sensitivity results had not been known a priori, employment of a user-defined iteration-stopping criterion would have likely produced an erroneous result, which would have been noticed by the user only if the user had had the foresight of computing the respective sensitivities independently, via finite-differences using FLUENT recomputations. Several other important sensitivities, including sensitivities to the boundary heat transfer coefficient and sensitivities to material properties (thermal conductivity and specific heat), cannot be obtained from the current FLUENT postprocessing output. Ideally, the solution verification of the adjoint functions produced by the FLUENT Adjoint Solver would be performed by directly comparing these to the exact expressions of the adjoint functions for the benchmark problem. Such a direct comparison and, hence, a direct solution verification of the FLUENT Adjoint Solver, is currently not possible, because the current FLUENT Adjoint Solver does not provide access to the adjoint functions it computes. Therefore, the results produced by the FLUENT Adjoint Solver can only be verified indirectly, by comparing temperature sensitivities computed using the FLUENT Adjoint Solver to the exact results obtained from the analytical expression of the corresponding benchmark sensitivities. This situation further underscores the need for developing additional thermal-hydraulics benchmark problems that admit exact solutions. © 2016, American Nuclear Society.

There is little analysis on why some scenario methods succeed and others fail (Bowman, Mac Kay, Masrani, and Mc Kiernan 2013). Although research, as determined though this study, confirms the benefits of applying foresight activities and scenario-planning, it is the opinion of the author that the case studies presented, even the ones involving large firms, are only limited to a particular organizational framework. It would be worthwhile to explore the degree of success or failure of such methods depending on context. This paper in particular critically analyzes the role of scenarios in strategic foresight. The results of this article indicate that scenario-planning is not perfect, its strengths and weaknesses are all quite evident, and therefore, to be successful in the turbulent future, organizations may take advantages from scenarios, while some other tools also can be necessary complements. The results have implications for academics as well as executives. To carry out scenarios in supporting strategy planning is always not easy, it requires leadership teams to be fully aware of the theory, as well as the practice techniques so that to overlook the entire situation as a whole. © Common Ground, Arif Sikander, All Rights Reserved.","Foresight; Organization; Scenario-planning; Strategic",,,,,,"Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A Review of Scenario Planning (2013) Futures, 46, pp. 23-40; Bowman, G., Bradley Mackay, R., Masrani, S., Kiernan, P.M., Storytelling and the Scenario Process: Understanding Success and Failure (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80, pp. 735-748; Durbach, I.N., Outranking under Uncertainty Using Scenarios (2013) European Journal of Operational Research, 232, pp. 98-108; Gordon, A., The Uses and Limits of Visionary Scenarios: Learning from the African Experience (2011) Foresight: The Journal of Futures Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 13 (4), pp. 64-81; Heger, T., Rohrbeck, R., Strategic Foresight for Collaborative Exploration of New Business Fields (2012) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 79 (5), pp. 819-831; Konno, N., Nonanka, I., Ogilvy, J., Scenario Planning: The Basics (2014) World Futures, 70 (1), 28p; Konno, N., Nonanka, I., Ogilvy, J., Introduction to the Special Issue on Strategy, Story, and Emergence: Essays on Scenario Planning (2014) World Futures, 70 (1), pp. 2-4; Kunc, M., Bhandari, R., Strategic Development Processes during Economic and Financial Crisis (2011) Management Decision, 49 (8), pp. 1343-1353; Liebl, F., Oliver, S.J., Normality of the Future: Trend Diagnosis for Strategic Foresight (2010) Futures, 42 (4), pp. 313-327; Mackay, B., McKiernan, P., Creativity and Dysfunction in Strategic Processes: The Case of Scenario Planning (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 271-281; Ram, C., Montibeller, G., Morton, A., Extending the Use of Scenario Planning and MCDA for the Evaluation of Strategic Options (2011) The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 62 (5), pp. 817-829; Ringland, G., The Role of Scenarios in Strategic Foresight (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77, pp. 1493-1498; Shearer, A.W., Critical Uncertainties in Time: An Experiment in Method (2013) Foresight: The Journal of Futures Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 15 (2), pp. 89-105; Stewart, T.J., French, S., Rios, J., Integrating Multicultural Decision Analysis and Scenario Planning - Review and Extension (2013) Omega, 41 (4), pp. 679-688; Stratigea, A., Giaoutzi, M., Linking Global to Regional Scenarios in Foresight (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 847-859; Vecchiato, R., Strategic Foresight: Matching Environmental Uncertainty (2012) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 24 (8), pp. 783-796","Sikander, A.; School of Management and Governance, Murdoch UniversityAustralia",,,"Common Ground Research Networks",,,,,2327798X,,,,"English","Change Manage.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960340319

This poses some unique challenges and opportunities. Many of the leaders of 2045 are being recruited and inducted into policing today, and as such it behoves policing to have a sense of what these future leaders will need so that they can be best prepared for their future roles across their careers. This requires police organizations and their current leaders to have the strategic foresight to understand how the challenges facing their organization will morph over the next 20-30 years. And it requires an understanding about how best to support future leaders for these roles. This article explores the role of education in achieving this. By no means a panacea for leader and leadership development, embedding education throughout the career of the future leader may serve the dual purpose of equipping the workforce as a whole to engage in leadership, while ensuring our future leaders have the high-level critical and creative thinking skills that complex problems require. Ensuring our police organizations value education and learning, however, is a cultural challenge that today's leaders need to address. © The Author 2016.",,,,,,,"Senior Executive Leadership Capability Framework, , http://www.apsc.gov.au/_data/assets/pdf_file/0006/4020/framework.pdf, (accessed 18 December 2013); Bradley, D., Nixon, C., 'Ending the Dialogue of the Deaf: Evidence and Policing Policies and Practices, An Australian Case Study' (2009) Police Practice and Research, 10 (5-6), pp. 423-435; Bartkowiak-Theron, I., Lieutier, F., 'Making Community Engagement a Core Business of Policing' (2014) Knowledge in Action: University-Community Engagement in Australia, pp. 116-131. , Bartkowiak-Théron, I. and Anderson, K.

In this model, investors' long-term perspective on the stock market matters and the revision on the perspective becomes a pricing factor.

A mechanism that allows for the comparison and quantification of the possibility of being a proven technology in the future, β for the existing fast reactor designs and concepts is proposed as one of the quantitative foresight method. The methodology starts with the identification at the national or regional level, of the factors that would affect β. The factors are then categorized into several groups; economic, social and technology elements. Each of the elements is proposed to be mathematically modelled before all of the elemental models can be combined. Once the overall β model is obtained, the β min is determined to benchmark the acceptance as a candidate design or concept. The β values for all the available designs and concepts are then determined and compared with the β min , resulting in a list of candidate designs that possess the β value that is larger than the β min . The proposed methodology can also be applied to purposes other than technological foresight. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.","Fast reactors; Generation IV reactor system; proven technology; technological foresight",,,,,,"Chapter 6: Powering the Malaysian economy with oil, gas and energy (2010) ETP Transformation Program: A Roadmap for Malaysia, p. 166. , Prime Minister Office Putrajaya: s.n; (2002) A Technological Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy System, , Generation IV International Forum OECD Nuclear Energy Agency; Martin, B.R., Irvine, J., (1989) Research Foresight: Priority-setting in Science, , London: Printer Publishers; Georghiou, Et.

The results of such an environment screening can be interpreted to explore/ exploit new business fields. As there was no systematic procedure available, the systematic approach which TRIZ is known for has been adopted for the foresight process. Trends in the environment of a company which are covering usually several market sectors and which are characterized by new technologies are defined as new business fields. A development direction specifies the implementation of a function or places the focus on certain components within a business field. Because of the different starting points two TRIZ-based procedures combining extrapolative and retropolative methods have been developed. The extrapolative approach of deriving new business fields contains a combination of TRIZ and foresight methods, which assist in deriving requirements. The interactions between requirements are analyzed, and contradictions are formulated. Overcoming the contradictions is embodied in future-oriented business fields. This approach is combined with retropolative methods. For deriving new directions of development it is fundamentally possible to start from existing business fields by adopting the procedural structure prepared for business fields. The other possibility is to start in a solution space. For this option standard TRIZ tools get combined. The key statement in the procedural strategy developed is that new business fields and development directions can be identified through overcoming mutually contradictory needs. © 2016 The Authors.","contradiction of requirements; direction of development; extrapolative and retropolative appraoch; foresight; new business field","contradiction of requirements; direction of development; extrapolative and retropolative appraoch; foresight; new business field; Problem solving",,,,,"Langbehn, A., (2010) Praxishandbuch Produktentwicklung: Grundlagen, Instrumente und Beispiele, Frankfurt Am Main, , Campus Verlag; Reichart, S., (2002) Kundenorientierung im Innovationsprozess, Wiesbaden, , Deutscher Universitätsverlag; http://www.schaeffler.de/content.schaeffler.de/de/innovation/culture_innovation/innovation_process/innovation_process.jsp, Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co.

The aim of the Delphi method was to identify and prioritize innovations, new business and diffusion strategies that were of importance in Specialty Coffees in Colombia. This study had consolidators on issues such as innovation, technology, new business and diffusion and marketing strategies. It is important to highlight that Delphi method was conducted in two rounds. Besides that, there were issues with consensus percentage between 50% and 75%. For example in innovations, seals combining marketing and fermentations controlled to induce sensory profiles coffee were made; in technologies: processes and benefit roasting profiles were the subjects of greater consensus. Additionally, in ""new business"", ecotourism and eco-organic products and new lines of business in the sector of specialty coffees were prominent. Also, the diffusion strategies that could be undertaken in the sector are clipping (media monitoring) and specialized databases. Finally, in common marketing code ""4Cs"" and system clean almonds are the most important.","Delphi method; Foresight; Specialty coffees",,,,,,"Arcila, P.J., Farfán, V.F., Moreno, B.A.M., Salazar, G.L.F., Hincapié, E.G., Sistemas de producción de café en Colombia (2007) Chinchiná, Cenicafé, p. 309. , 6A6Aa:xa.

What trajectory will social protection follow, which actors will drive it forward and what will be the main issues and challenges? This article reports on a small foresight study designed to address the question: ‘Where next for social protection?' A scenario-building exercise revealed that there is no single linear pathway for social protection, but multiple highly context-specific trajectories subject to change as political ideologies and institutional capacities shift. A ‘wind-tunnelling’ exercise highlighted the importance of a country’s political regime as a fundamental determinant of which social protection policies will be adopted. Better understanding of political processes is needed to protect gains made in social protection against possible reversals when the political climate shifts against pro-poor redistributive policies. © 2016 Institute of Development Studies.","Drivers of change; Foresight; Rights-based approaches; Scenario-building; Social protection; Wind-tunnelling","policy development; political ideology; political process; social policy; wind tunnel",,,,,"(2013) The Social Protection Index - Assessing Results for Asia and the Pacific, , Mandaluyong City: Asian Development Bank; Cecchini, S., Martínez, R., (2012) Inclusive Social Protection in Latin America: A Comprehensive, Rights-based Approach, , Santiago: United Nations; Cook, S., (2009) Social Protection in East and Southeast Asia: A Regional Review, , paper prepared as part of a Social Protection Scoping Study funded by the Ford Foundation, Brighton: IDS; de Haan, A., The Rise of Social Protection in Development:Progress, Pitfalls and Politics (2014) European Journal of Development Research, 26, pp. 311-321; Devereux, S., Sabates-Wheeler, R., (2004) Transformative Social Protection, , IDS Working Paper 232, Brighton: IDS; Devereux, S., White, P., Social Protection in Africa: Evidence, Politics and Rights (2010) Poverty and Public Policy, pp. 53-77. , 2.3; (2011) The Promise of Protection: Social Protection and Development in Asia and the Pacific, , Bangkok: United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific; Gentilini, U., Omamo, S.W., Social Protection 2.0: Exploring Issues, Evidence and Debates in a Globalizing World (2011) Food Policy, 36, pp. 329-340; Hickey, S., Conceptualising the Politics of Social Protection in Africa (2008) Social Protection for the Poor and Poorest: Concepts, Policies and Politics, , in A.

In this paper, the aim is to analyse how intermediaries support collaborative innovation processes taking place in green maritime technology projects. In particular, retrofit projects related to cleaner technologies and small vessels are an understudied subject. The case study of a Danish small island ferry retrofit shows that intermediaries are important to stage the collaboration between actors. They can provide functions to the incipient network as foresight, brokering, increasing network connectivity and scanning of information. However, intermediaries can also have a proactive role in shaping the emerging innovation pathways. In this case study, intermediaries negotiate each partner's role and define the goals of the project. The results contribute to the broader eco-innovation literature by analysing intermediation in innovation in a process perspective. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Collaboration; Demonstration projects; Denmark; Eco-innovation; Ferry; Green maritime technology; Innovation intermediaries; Intermediation",,,,,,"Agogué, M., Yström, A., Le Masson, P., Rethinking the role of intermediaries as an architect of collective exploration and creation of knowledge in open innovation (2013) International Journal of Innovation Management, 17 (2), pp. 13500071-135000724; Buhaug, Ø., Corbett, J.J., Endresen, Ø., Eyring, V., Faber, J., Hanayama, S., Lee, D.S., Yoshida, K., (2009) Second IMO GHG Study, , International Maritime Organization, London; Calder, B.J., Phillips, L.W., Tybout, A.M., The concept of external validity (1982) Journal of Consumer Research, 9, pp. 240-244; Chesbrough, H., The era of open innovation (2003) Sloan Management Review, pp. 35-41. , Summer; Chunhavuthiyanon, M., Intarakumnerd, P., The role of intermediaries in sectoral innovation system: The case of Thailand's food industry (2014) International Journal of Technology Management and Sustainable Development, 13 (1), pp. 15-36; Colombo, G., Dell'Era, C., Frattini, F., Exploring the contribution of innovation intermediaries to the new product development (NPD) process: A typology and an empirical study (2014) R&D Management, 45 (2), pp. 126-146; Corbett, J.J., Fischbeck, P.S., Commercial marine emissions and life-cycle analysis of retrofit controls in a changing science and policy environment (2002) Naval Engineers Journal, 114 (1), pp. 93-106; DNV, (2012) Shipping 2020, , Det Norske Veritas-Germanischer Lloyd, Oslo; Dubois, A., Gadde, L.-E., Systematic combining: An abductive approach to case research (2002) Markets as Networks, 55 (7), pp. 553-560; Eide, M.S., Endresen, Ø., Skjong, R., Longva, T., Alvik, S., Cost-effectiveness assessment of CO2 reducing measures in shipping (2009) Maritime Policy and Management, 36 (4), pp. 367-384; Feller, J., Finnegan, P., Hayes, J., O'Reilly, P., Orchestrating' sustainable crowdsourcing: A characterisation of solver brokerages (2012) Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 21 (3), pp. 216-232; Flyvbjerg, B., Case study (2011) The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research, pp. 301-316. , Denzin, N.K. and Lincoln, Y.S.

I have never forgotten his words and nowadays, I am sometimes impatient with my students or my younger colleagues, and bite my lips in order not to repeat the same sentences.

The four hypotheses of the article can be discussed in a similar way today - and the questions remain the same. Some reasons, arguments and events or names have changed, but it is still up to date!

The research process is at the heart of the development of successful quantitative strategies. Key factors for their success are the availability of more and better data, advances in computational and econometric methods, and better understanding of how to enhance judgment in the research process. Our discussion does not provide rules to follow, but rather tenets that emerged from our collective experience of researching and developing quantitative models. By identifying and examining the characteristics of quantitative strategies, we attempt to highlight some best practices in quantitative modeling and aspire to outline a broader paradigm for building successful models. These characteristics may not be strictly statistical or mathematical in nature, but rather they emphasize the integration of market dynamics, data, research design, modeling techniques, and economic and financial judgment. In Superforecasting, Tetlock and Gardner [2015] state that ""foresight isn't a mysterious gift bestowed at birth. It is the product of particular ways of thinking, of gathering information, of updating beliefs."" In this article, we share some insights on accomplishing this objective by providing a framework and some thoughts on building quantitative forecasting models. Our discussion centers on developing quantitative models regardless of asset class, but our examples draw heavily from equities. Although we focus on quantitative research methodologies, we think that some of these ideas are valuable for a fundamental research process. © 2017 Institutional Investor LLC.

A definition of chance (casus) was analyzed as faultless causing of harm from a perspective of delimitation of the concept from carelessness in the form of criminal negligence. Particular attention is paid to the legislative definition of faultless causing of harm, which is found in criminal codes of foreign countries. Based on the study, the author has identified characteristic features of the chance (casus), which included: special form of mental attitude of a person to his deeds (the absence of such attitude), faultless causing of harm, absence of fault, objectively random effects, commission of acts that resulted in socially dangerous consequences by a person who has all the features of the perpetrator. The concept of chance (casus) in criminal law was determined and substantiated. A chance (casus) is faultless causing of harm by a person who has all the features of the perpetrator when committing an act that led to socially dangerous consequences when the person was not aware of and could not recognize socially dangerous consequences of his actions or did not foresee the possibility of socially dangerous consequences and circumstances and should not have or could not foresee them. As a result of research, the author proves the necessity of legislative regulation of chance (casus) in domestic criminal law, on the basis of which it is proposed to include Article 25-1 ""Chance (casus)"" in the Criminal Code of Ukraine. © 2016 Veresha.","Casus (chance); Criminal negligence; Faultless causing of harm; Foresight of socially dangerous consequences; Perpetrator",,,,,,"Adamjan, A.S., Historical and legal aspects of regulation of faultless causing of harm (Casus) category in Ukraine (2014) Customs Affairs: Scientific and Analytical Journal, 5 (95), pp. 110-115; Badar, M.E., (2013) The Concept of Mens Rea in International Criminal Law, , The Case for a Unified Approach.

Design/methodology/approach: A study based on a quantitative approach has been designed. Data have been collected through closed questionnaires from a sample of firms. The study has been conducted in the electronics industry in Italy based on the dynamism of the setting. Through SPSS-AMOS application, path analysis has been performed to conduct a first assessment of the theoretical model. Findings: The dimensions of strategic agility are relevant capabilities for improving competitive activity. Furthermore, increasing strategic agility in the three dimensions (customer, operational and partnering) depends on the ability to improve other dynamic capabilities of the organization, including IT competency, systematic insight and strategic foresight. Finally, strategic agility results to be the only variable able to leverage the firm’s competitive activity. Research limitations/implications: The study presents some limitations linked to the response rate and the ability to conduct further analysis. However, it highlights the main dimensions that managers and entrepreneurs should develop to improve the competitive activities of the firm. Practical implications: The paper addresses practitioners’ need to identify the main variable to leverage in order to increase firms’ competitivity. Social implications: The results of the study offer the opportunity for new reflections when designing business executives’ training programs and defining recruitment pathways. Originality/value: This is the first study that investigates strategic agility building in a turbulent environment in the Italian setting. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive activity; Dynamic capabilities; IT environment; Italy; Strategic agility",,,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: knowledge management and knowledge management systems: conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Appiah, G., Sarpong, D., On the influence of organisational routines on strategic foresight (2015) Foresight, 17 (5), pp. 512-527; Arteta, B.M., Giachetti, R.E., A measure of agility as the complexity of the enterprise system (2004) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 20 (6), pp. 495-503; Barnett, W.P., Freeman, J., Too much of a good thing?

Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a new method of watershed segmentation based on morphology. A dimensional increment matrix calculation method and an image segmentation method combined with a fuzzy clustering algorithm are provided. The visibility of the segmented image and the segmentation accuracy of a defective image are guaranteed. Findings - Compared with the traditional one, the segmentation result obtained in this study is superior in aspects of noise control and defect segmentation. It completely proves that the segmentation method proposed in this study is better matches the requirements of FPC defect extraction and can more effectively provide the segmentation result. Compared with traditional human operators, this system ensures greater accuracy and more objective detection results. Research limitations/implications - The extraction of FPC defect characteristics contains some obvious characteristics as well as many implied characteristics. These characteristics can be extracted through specific space conversion and arithmetical operation. Therefore, more images are required for analysis and foresight to establish a more widely used FPC defect detection sorting algorithm. Originality/value - This paper proposes a new method of watershed segmentation based on morphology. It combines a traditional edge detection algorithm and mathematical morphology. The FPC surface defect detection system can meet the requirements of online detection through constant design and improvement. Therefore, human operators will be replaced by machine vision, which can preferably reduce the production costs and improve the efficiency of FPC production. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Defect; Image segmentation; Visual detection","Clustering algorithms; Computer circuits; Computer vision; Defects; Edge detection; Extraction; Flexible electronics; Fuzzy clustering; Image matching; Mathematical morphology; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuits; Reconfigurable hardware; Surface defects; Arithmetical operations; Design/methodology/approach; Edge detection algorithms; Flexible printed circuit; Flexible printed circuit boards; Surface defect detection systems; Visual detection; Watershed segmentation; Image segmentation",,,,,"Guo, F.L., Guan, S.A., Research of the machine vision based PCB defect inspection system (2011) International Conference on Intelligence Science and Information Engineer, pp. 472-475. , ISIE, Wuhan; Lijuan, J., Zhenhai, M., Yanyan, C., Qiang, D., Bo, F., Research and application on vision algorithm of FPC detection registration system (2014) Development & Innovation of Machinery & Electrical Products, No.3, pp. 119-121; Lili, S., (2013) Analysis of Teaching Method of Graphics Software, , China New Telecommunications, Beijing; Lu, L., Yueming, H., Flushbonading detection system based on machine vision (2011) Computer Measurement and Control, (2), pp. 303-305. , www.iciba.com/; Ming, Y., Yanqin, P., Extraction method of interested area of an image (2012) Electronic Design Engineering, 20 (7), pp. 160-162; Qingxiang Di W, L., Wujie, Z., Feng, Y., Unsupervised detection of soft circuit board gold surface (2010) Optics and Precision Engineering, (4), pp. 981-987; Steger, C., Ulrich, M., Wiedemann, C., (2008) Machine Vision Algorithms and Applications, , Tsinghua University Press, Beijing; Xiehua, S., (2010) Digital Image Processing - Principle and Algorithm, , China Machine Press, Beijing; Yaqin, H., Lin, L., Research on component size detection based on machine vision (2010) Coal Mine Machinery, 31 (6), pp. 102-104; Yaya, L., Zhijie, L., Comparison and realization of image fringe detection algorithm (2010) Computer Engineering and Design, (9), pp. 71-75; Yingchun, X., Application of machine vision technology in printed circuit board detection (2012) Neijiang Science & Technology, (11), pp. 99-100; Yuanyuan, T., Qingchang, T., Haibo, Z., Stability analysis of sub pixel edge location algorithm (2010) Computer Engineering, 36 (7), pp. 211-213","Zhou, Y.; School of Aeronautic Science and Engineering, Beihang UniversityChina; email: zhouym@ibhsedu.com",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,03056120,,CIWOD,,"English","Circuit World",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975296977

Strategic decisions can furthermore be strengthened by tools still in development and under research, as the Trends of Engineering Systems Evolution and their underlying mechanisms. One of the difficulties when using TRIZ tools is the large number of possibilities for using and combining them for the best effect. Especially during the analysis phase, a lot of information has to be gathered that leads to problem models and task definition for later problem solving. To expand the usage of analytical tools for strategic decisions for long-term disruptive innovations or short-term incremental innovations, this chapter proposes a scientific approach that is based on the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving and its findings. The described procedure helps companies to find the right long- or short-term decisions: (a) They can check when their product might be eliminated from the market by following products and new settings and define indicators for long-term decisions, what the next products could be; (b) Similar to the forecast procedure the incremental way of further product development can also be checked and with this overview the development steps for the R&D, production, and sales departments can be better planned. The approach combines proven tools like Function Analysis with a new approach for modeling complex engineering systems (Nested Function Models), 9-Screen Models, S-Curve Analysis, and the Trends of Engineering System Evolution. This chapter examines the interactions between components on different system levels, the use of the model in conjunction with trimming, and the integration of the Multi-Screen Approach for developing a basis for strategic product development decisions. Furthermore, the possibilities of connecting Trends of Engineering Systems with this approach are explored. The suggested approach is aimed at creating an extensive, multilevel product map that combines the benefits of several classical TRIZ tools.

This research advances knowledge on the practice of foresight in long-term planning through a comparative analysis of planning approaches in two organisations linked through common ownership. Data generated from planning documentation and the foresight practice of strategy personnel in the two cases (transport and banking) provided support for a dynamic model of foresight integrated LT planning. The ongoing collection and synthesis of strong and weak signals, and their continual assimilation into scenarios depicting alternative futures was structurally supported by a community-of-practice. The community-of-practice widely engaged strategists located across organisational levels in conversations about emerging futures and about strategies through which to engage those futures. The findings encourage managers and researchers to view long-term planning as an ongoing interrogation of implemented and envisioned strategies within emerging, alternative futures. Such an approach stimulates strategic entrepreneurship and prepares the organisation for engaging in future environments. © 2013.","Community-of-practice; Foresight; Long-term planning","Technological forecasting; Community of practice; Comparative analysis; Foresight; Long term planning; Organisational level; Research advances; Strategic capability; Weak signals; Innovation",,,,,"Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, 1. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; Ofek, E., Wathieu, L., Are you ignoring trends that could shape up your business?

A variety of methods have been developed to support and improve the technological scanning process but the success of corporate foresight activities depends initially and heavily on the quality of information processing at the 'front end of innovation'. Since this information activity involves individual members of the organization it is important to examine the general cognitive and intuitive abilities of these individuals. In order to enrich existing knowledge in this context, this paper explores the technology identification and evaluation process from a psychological standpoint, looking in particular at the concept of cognitive prototypes and intuition of technological gatekeepers. The findings of this study show that technological gatekeepers possess specific cognitive prototype models and thinking patterns, which exert an influence on identification and evaluation of technologies and that the number of features a thinking pattern contains is correlated with the number of years spent in a position in the organization as technological gatekeeper. Our exploration of the role of intuition also highlighted a discrepancy between the individual and the organization. While it is perceived on an individual level as a valuable tool, it is seen by technological gatekeepers as inappropriate on an organizational level. As a result, gut feeling is not always acknowledged or communicated within the organization in the technology identification and evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive prototype; Corporate foresight; Gut feeling; Technological gatekeeper; Technology evaluation; Technology identification","Technological forecasting; Cognitive prototype; Corporate foresight; Gut feeling; Technological gatekeepers; Technology evaluation; Technology identification; Innovation; Pyronia tithonus",,,,,"Costanzo, L.A., Strategic foresight in a high-speed environment (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 219-235; Postma, T.J.B.M., Alers, J.C., Terpstra, S., Zuurbier, A., Medical technology decisions in The Netherlands: how to solve the dilemma of technology foresight versus market research?

Hayek anticipated the notion of ‘recursive utility’ and analytically reconstructs his informal exposition of the optimal saving process. The scope of analysis is restricted to Hayek's largely unrecognised contribution in Utility Analysis and Interest in 1936, restated as chapters 17 and 18 in The Pure Theory of Capital, first published in 1941. It is shown that Hayek characterised efficient dynamic choice as an infinite series of two-period optimality conditions by transforming an infinite-horizon optimisation problem into a perpetual confrontation of current and prospective utility, that he hinted at the axiomatic base of stationary and weakly separable dynamic preferences, and that he endogenised the subjective discount rate to substantiate his claim that the interest-rate path in a perfect-foresight equilibrium is unidirectionally determined by the marginal productivity of investment (and not by thrift). Hayek's vision of dynamic social efficiency and dynamic equilibrium is completely characterised. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","analytical reconstruction; Hayek; increasing myopia; optimal capital deepening; recursive utility",,,,,,"Araujo, A., Lack of pareto optimal allocations in economies with infinitely many commodities: the need for impatience (1985) Econometrica, 53 (2), pp. 455-461; Becker, R.A., Boyd, J.H., III, (1997) Capital theory, equilibrium analysis and recursive utility, , Malden: MA: Blackwell; Bellman, R., (1957) Dynamic programming, , Princeton: NJ: Princeton University Press; Bewley, T.F., Existence of equilibria in economies with infinitely many commodities (1972) Journal of economic theory, 4 (3), pp. 514-540; Bewley, T.F., An integration of equilibrium theory and turnpike theory (1982) Journal of mathematical economics, 10, pp. 233-267; Bliss, C.J., (1975) Capital theory and the distribution of income, , Amsterdam/New York: North-Holland/American Elsevier; Boianovsky, M., Wicksell, Ramsey and the theory of interest (1998) Journal of the history of economic thought, 5 (1), pp. 140-168; Böhm-Bawerk, E., (1959) Capital and interest, 2. , Huncke G.D., Sennholz H.F., (eds), South Holland: Libertarian Press; Boldrin, M., Paths of optimal growth in two-sector models (1989) Economic complexity: chaos, sunspots, bubbles and nonlinearity, pp. 231-252. , Barnett W.A., Geweke J., Shell K., (eds), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Boldrin, M., Montrucchio, L., On the indeterminacy of optimal capital accumulation paths (1986) Journal of economic theory, 40 (1), pp. 26-39; Bortkiewicz, L., Der Kardinalfehler der Böhm-Bawerkschen Zinstheorie (1906) Schmollers jahrbuch, 30 (3), pp. 61-90; Burmeister, E., Wicksell effects (1990) The new palgrave: capital theory, pp. 257-261. , Eatwell J., Milgate M., Newman P., (eds), New York: W.

This analysis aims to expose or make visible the scopic regimes at work when interpreting the event. By referencing Judith Butler’s “frame theory” (2009) and Nicholas Mirzoeff’s “the right to look” (2011), the event is unpacked, among other things, as the volatile intersection of differing world views and technics of vision. Three scopic frames are used to interrogate the event: the first aims to unmask “oversights” during the event, whereas the remaining two deal more with inversions of sight which bear on “foresight” and “insight”. In terms of oversight, the first frame refers to the overseeing or invigilation of the event via instruments of visuality or vision machines (e.g. satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and helicopters), promising complete transparency. The second oversight comes in the representations of the events as media spectacle, becoming part of a new mediated visibility. The final oversight refers to the miners as subalterns becoming visible in a system that renders them invisible from the start. The second cluster of the visual complex, namely the appeal to foresight, surfaces through the calling on a Sangoma (traditional healer) for muti (traditional medicine) to render the miners invincible/invisible to the enemy. The third and final cluster refers to artists Ayanda Mabulu’s Yakhal’inkomo—Black man’s cry (2013) and Mary Wafer’s Mine exhibition (2012), aiming to provide some insight into the unrepresentability of the event. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","aerial view; countervisuality; magic/occult; Marikana massacre; scopic regimes; subterranean; visuality",,,,,,"Achebe, C., An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness’ (1977) Massachusetts Review, 18, pp. 1783-1794; Azoulay, A., (2008) The Civil Contract of Photography, , New York: Zone Books; Azoulay, A., What is a Photograph?

Box 1300, Tampere, 33101, Finland","The design, management and evaluation of foresight is challenging firstly due to the vast diversity of foresight practices and secondly due to its embeddedness in the context of other policy processes. To help overcome these challenges we look at the contributions of foresight from multiple perspectives in a systemic way and propose the concept of multi-layered foresight, which analyses the contributions of foresight to knowledge, relations and capabilities on four layers: landscape, system, organisation and individual. We construct these layers building on earlier literature and illustrate them with a case example from the region of Antofagasta in Chile. We argue that foresight exercises benefit from considering multiple levels and respective different emphases in analysis. For instance, on the landscape layer the focus tends to be on contributions to knowledge while on the organisational layer it is more on capabilities. The layers help position the foresight exercise and its effects in relation to the broader context. Thus, we expect the concept of multi-layered foresight to support the design, management and evaluation of foresight. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Foresight; Foresight design; Foresight evaluation; Innovation system","design; innovation; knowledge; planning method; regional planning; Antofagasta; Chile",,,,,"Alkemade, F., Kleinschmidt, C., Hekkert, M., Analysing emerging innovation systems: a functions approach to foresight (2007) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 3 (2), pp. 139-168; Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Andersen, P.D., Andersen, A.D., Jensen, P.A., Rasmussen, B., Sectoral innovation system foresight in practice: nordic facilities management foresight (2014) Futures, 61, pp. 33-44; Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Innovation system foresight (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 88, pp. 276-286; (2002) The globalizing learning economy, , Oxford University Press, D.

Strategic foresight uses a variety of methods to assess possible future events. Combining different foresight methods and integrating expert opinions transform the strategic foresight process into a powerful but major undertaking. IT systems can assist with the growing complexity of strategic foresight methods. Currently, specialized IT systems can support various strategic foresight methods and foresight activities, but these are generally focused on isolated applications rather than providing a holistic solution.This article contributes to the field of foresight support systems by documenting and demonstrating the development and implementation of a foresight support system tailored for the German Federal Armed Forces. We draw on a literature-based design for foresight support systems and demonstrate how our system addresses issues raised in the literature. Our system provides a holistic approach to strategic foresight incorporating the rules of order in foresight processes, foresight method combinations, mechanisms for the reuse of foresight activity results, and collaborative decision-making. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight methods; Foresight process; Foresight support system; Software development; Web-based collaboration","Decision making; Social networking (online); Software engineering; World Wide Web; Collaborative decision making; Dynamic environments; Foresight methods; Holistic approach; Possible futures; Strategic foresight; Support systems; Web-based collaboration; Software design",,,,,"Rohrbeck, R., Schwarz, J.O., The value contribution of strategic foresight: Insights from an empirical study of large European companies (2013) Technol.

These tools are integrated into an approach that encompasses the discovery of change, interpretation, and triggering managerial responses. The overall system consists of a tool for scanning for weak signals on change (PEACOQ Scouting Tool), a tool for collecting internal ideas (PEACOQ Gate 0.5), and a tool for triggering organizational responses (Foresight Landing page). Particularly the link to innovation management and R&D strategy is discussed in detail.

The intersection of design and futures produces artifacts, applications and interactions created to provoke dialog in an accessible manner. As part of the Futures special issue on the Emerge: Artists and Scientists Redesign the Future event, this article describes the documentation and public representation of the creative outcomes from nine Emerge design futures workshops. These workshops provided a rich opportunity to study how designers and futurists collaboratively engage, implement and communicate alternative futures.

Prior studies typically use the midpoint to evaluate analyst reaction to range forecasts, implicitly assuming that analysts place equal weights on the upper and the lower bounds of management range forecasts. We empirically test this restrictive assumption and provide strong evidence of unequal weights - analysts place significantly more (less) weight on the lower (upper) bound of forecast ranges. Moreover, such overweight on the lower bound is more pronounced when analysts face higher ambiguity, consistent with the ""max-min"" axiom, which predicts that decision-makers tend to assign higher probability to the worst-case scenario when facing ambiguity. Further tests show that ""optimal revisions"" with perfect foresight of actual earnings also overweight the lower bound. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,,,,"Ajinkya, B., Bhojraj, S., Sengupta, P., The association between outside directors, institutional investors and the properties of management earnings forecasts (2005) Journal of Accounting Research, 43, pp. 343-376; Ajinkya, B., Gift, M., Corporate managers' earnings forecasts and symmetrical adjustments of market expectations (1984) Journal of Accounting Research, 22, pp. 425-444; Baginski, S., Conrad, E., Hassell, J., The effects of management forecast precision on equity pricing and on the assessment of earnings uncertainty (1993) The Accounting Review, 68, pp. 913-927; Baginski, S.P., Hassell, J., The market interpretation of management earnings forecasts as a predictor of subsequent financial analyst forecast revision (1990) The Accounting Review, 65, pp. 175-190; Baginski, S.P., Hassell, J., Wieland, M., An examination of the effects of management earnings forecast form and explanations on financial analyst forecast revisions (2011) Advances in Accounting, Incorporating Advances in International Accounting, 27, pp. 17-25; Ball, R., Shivakumar, L., How much new information is there in earnings?

We teach the methodology to undergraduate business administration students - potential e.g., managers and policymakers in the future healthcare system of Geneva. Our objective is twofold: to train students at scenario building and to develop scenarios for pervasive healthcare technologies and their social implications. Results include scenarios developed by the students as well as lessons learned with respect to the power of foresight techniques employed with novices in this field.","Foresight; Healthcare system; Policymaking; Scenarios; Social implications; Visionary thinking",,,,,,"Aguilar, F., (1967) Scanning the business environment, , NY: Macmillan; Ansoff, I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Arcade, J., Godet, M., Meunier, F., Roubelat, F., (1999) Structural analysis with the MICMAC method & Actor's strategy with MACTOR method, , Washington, DC: Millennium Project; Blackman, C.R., Our health, our future (1995) Futures, 27 (9-10), pp. 919-920; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K.H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario types and techniques: Towards a user's guide (2006) Futures, 38 (7), pp. 723-739; Jouvenel, H.D., A brief methodological guide to scenario building (2000) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 65 (1), pp. 37-48; Durance, P., Godet, M., Scenario building: uses and abuses (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1488-1492; Godet, M., Durance, P., (2011) La prospective stratégique pour les entreprises et les territoires, , (2nd ed.).

To date, reasonable practical experience has been accumulated, but there is a lack of a comprehensive conceptual approach for using strategic foresight and roadmapping to solve management problems. Design/methodology/approach – This approach integrates corporate strategic foresight and roadmapping in several stages. During the foresight phase, the authors create scenarios of long-term development determined by long-term macro trends and challenges to identify “points of growth” and system of priorities for company growth. A strategic roadmap enables the company to form a “corridor” for specific projects and create a long-term action plan to implement the priorities identified in the first phase. Using a project roadmap makes it possible to ensure the implementation of a specific project, defining a system of goals, the necessary measures, their timing and financing, as well as indicators to assess their effectiveness. Findings – The core result of the suggested methodology is a set of possible trajectories of innovation development, reflecting the whole technological chain involving R&D – technology – product – market. Each path involves a sequence of organizational actions and key decision-making points that are necessary to be taken to introduce new technological solutions and develop innovation products with new features to the customer/user. These routes support decision-making in such fields as the choice of the product line, establishment of new partnerships with developers of innovation technologies, decisions regarding “insourcing-outsourcing” and the requirements for relevant scientific and technological breakthroughs. It allows corporations to create strategies for commercializing innovation products. Originality/value – The methodology proposes to integrate the results of foresight studies and in roadmaps and finally in business planning, adopting innovative strategies and management decisions. It contributes to the development of common principles and approaches to the subject, while taking account of company-specific features that can significantly affect the decision-making mechanism. The methodology is applicable to foreign and Russian companies when creating innovative strategies and management decisions based on the results of foresight. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate foresight; Innovation; Integrated roadmapping; Strategic foresight; Technology route",,,,,,"Alsan, A., Corporate foresight in emerging markets: Action research at a multinational company in Turkey (2008) Futures, 40 (1), pp. 47-55; Battistella, C., The organisation of corporate foresight: A multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Becker, P., (2002) Corporate foresight in Europe: A first overview, , Working Paper European Commission, European Commission, Brussels; Bokov, M.B., Velikanova, N.P., Vishnevskiy, K., Edelkina, A., Klubova, M., Thurner, T., After 300 meters turn right-the future of Russia's GLONASS and the development of global satellite navigation systems (2014) Foresight, 16 (5), pp. 448-461; Carayannis, E.G., Alexander, J., Is technological learning a firm core competence, when, how and why?

This study extends the existing literature on dynamic capabilities in service innovation by operationalizing the capabilities of sensing and seizing new opportunities. The purpose of this chapter is to examine how futures thinking and design thinking can facilitate service innovation from the dynamic capabilities point-of-view. As a result this chapter provides a conceptual framework for service innovation process that is grounded on foresight and service design. To synthesize the literature into a new conceptual framework, this chapter is based on a large body of literature from four burgeoning fields of study: Dynamic capabilities, service innovation, foresight, and service design. The key point the chapter wishes to make is that a forward look at new methodological perspectives in service innovation is needed and that integrating the methods and tools of foresight and service design to the service innovation process provides a promising new avenue to future success. © Springer-Verlag London 2015.","Dynamic capabilities; Foresight; Service design; Service innovation",,,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Sanders, T.I., Complexity as a sensemaking framework for methodology (2005) Complexity as a Sensemaking Framework, pp. 21-37. , Aaltonen M, Barth T, Casti JL, Mitleton-Kelly E, Sanders TI, FFRC-publications 4/2005, Finland Futures Research Centre, Turku; Albright, K.S., Environmental scanning: Radar for success (2004) Inform Manag J, 38 (3), pp. 38-45; Agarwal, R., Selen, W., Dynamic capability building in service value networks for achieving service innovation (2009) Decis Sci, 40 (3), pp. 431-475; Alstyne, G., (2010) How We Learned to Pluralize the Future: Foresight Scenarios as Design Thinking, pp. 69-91. , Shamiyeh (ed) Creating desired futures—how design thinking innovates business.

In addition, each player has an independent probability to observe the opponent's foresight ability. We show that if this probability is not too close to 0 or 1, then the game admits an evolutionarily stable strategy, in which agents who look one step ahead and agents who look three steps ahead coexist. Moreover, this is the unique evolutionarily stable strategy in which players play efficiently at early stages of the interaction. We interpret our results as a novel evolutionary foundation for limited foresight and as a new mechanism to induce cooperation in the repeated prisoner's dilemma. © 2015 Yuval Heller.","Limit Ess; Limited Foresight; Prisoner's Dilemma",,,,,,"Andreoni, J., Miller, J.H., Rational cooperation in the finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma: Experimental evidence (1993) Economic Journal, 103, pp. 570-585; Axelrod, R.M., (1984) The Evolution of Cooperation, , Basic Books, New York; Bendor, J., Swistak, P., The evolutionary stability of cooperation (1997) American Political Science Review, 91, pp. 290-307; Binmore, K.G., Samuelson, L., Evolutionary stability in repeated games played by finite automata (1992) Journal of Economic Theory, 57, pp. 278-305; Bolton, G.E., The rationality of splitting equally (1997) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 32, pp. 365-381; Bruttel, L.V., Güth, W., Kamecke, U., Finitely repeated prisoners' dilemma experiments without a commonly known end (2012) International Journal of Game Theory, 41, pp. 23-47; Camerer, C.F., (2003) Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Cooper, R., DeJong, D.V., Forsythe, R., Ross, T.W., Cooperation without reputation: Experimental evidence from prisoner's dilemma games (1996) Games and Economic Behavior, 12, pp. 187-218; Costa-Gomes, M., Crawford, V.P., Broseta, B., Cognition and behavior in normal-form games: An experimental study (2001) Econometrica, 69, pp. 1193-1235; Crawford, V.P., Lying for strategic advantage: Rational and boundedly rational misrepresentation of intentions (2003) American Economic Review, 93, pp. 133-149; Cressman, R., Local stability of smooth selection dynamics for normal form games (1997) Mathematical Social Sciences, 34, pp. 1-19; Dekel, E., Ely, J.C., Yilankaya, O., Evolution of preferences (2007) Review of Economic Studies, 74, pp. 685-704; Fudenberg, D., Maskin, E., Evolution and cooperation in noisy repeated games (1990) American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings, 80, pp. 274-279; Geanakoplos, J., Gray, L., When seeing further is not seeing better (1991) Bulletin of the Santa Fe Institute, 6, pp. 4-9; Haviland, W.A., Prins, H., Walrath, D., McBride, B., (2007) Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge, , Wadsworth, Belmont; Heller, Y., Stability and trembles in extensive-form games (2014) Games and Economic Behavior, 84, pp. 132-136; Jehiel, P., Limited foresight may force cooperation (2001) Review of Economic Studies, 68, pp. 369-391; Johnson, E.J., Camerer, C., Sen, S., Rymon, T., Detecting failures of backward induction: Monitoring information search in sequential bargaining (2002) Journal of Economic Theory, 104, pp. 16-47; Kim, Y.-G., Evolutionary stability in the asymmetric war of attrition (1993) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 161, pp. 13-21; Kim, Y.-G., Evolutionarily stable strategies in the repeated prisoner's dilemma (1994) Mathematical Social Sciences, 28, pp. 167-197; Kraines, D., Kraines, V., Pavlov and the prisoner's dilemma (1989) Theory and Decision, 26, pp. 47-79; Kreps, D.M., Wilson, R., Sequential equilibria (1982) Econometrica, 50, pp. 863-894; Kreps, D.M., Milgrom, P., Roberts, J., Wilson, R., Rational cooperation in the finitely repeated prisoners' dilemma (1982) Journal of Economic Theory, 27, pp. 245-252; Leimar, O., Repeated games: A state space approach (1997) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 184, pp. 471-498; Lorberbaum, J., No strategy is evolutionarily stable in the repeated prisoner's dilemma (1994) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 168, pp. 117-130; Lorberbaum, J.P., Bohning, D.E., Shastri, A., Sine, L.E., Are there really no evolutionarily stable strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma?

Future-oriented information is gathered by various agents, but firms still struggle to find relevant information and transform it into profitable businesses and innovations. Intermediary organisations play an important role in the interfacing of knowledge producers and knowledge exploiters. This paper studies the role of intermediary organisations in promoting the use of foresight information in small and medium-sized enterprises. A qualitative case study approach is used. The study emphasises the importance of interpreting foresight information through communicative processes and combines these ideas at the system level, providing new insights not only on the theoretical level but also for developing the innovation policy practice.

The objective of the developed model is to maximize the leader's market share while predicting the follower's response. In the classical competitive facility location model, it is assumed that the facility competes for all customers no matter how far they are. Although widely applied the model is, the flaws are obvious. This paper considers the service distance constraint and propose a new customer behavior, which is more accurate than the existing models. For solving the model, a two-stage hybrid tabu search algorithm is proposed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a set of randomly generated instances are presented and analyzed statistically. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides an effective means to solve the problems and the service distance is proved to be a significant factor in the model.","Bilevel nonlinear integer programming; Competitive facility location problem; Gravity-based model; Service distance; Tabu search","Competition; Facilities; Integer programming; Location; Problem solving; Tabu search; Competitive facility location; Competitive facility location models; Customer behavior; Distance constraints; Gravity-based models; Hybrid tabu search; Non-linear integer programming; Service distance; Location based services",,,,,"Plastria, F., Static competitive facility location: An overview of optimisation approaches (2001) European Journal of Operational Research, 129 (3), pp. 461-470; Ashtiani, M.G., Makui, A., Ramezanian, R., A robust model for a leader-follower competitive facility location problem in a discrete space (2013) Applied Mathematical Modelling, pp. 62-71; Beresnev, V., Branch-and-bound algorithm for a competitive facility location problem (2013) Computers and Operations Research, 40 (8), pp. 2062-2070; Hakimi, S.L., On locating new facilities in a competitive environment (1983) European Journal of Operational Research, 12 (1), pp. 29-35; Eiselt, H.A., Laporte, G., Sequential location problems (1997) European Journal of Operational Research, 96 (2), pp. 217-231; Kress, D., Pesch, E., Sequential competitive location on networks (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 217 (3), pp. 483-499; Shiode, S., Drezner, Z., A competitive facility location problem on a tree network with stochastic weights (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 149 (1), pp. 47-52; Ahn, H.K., Cheng, S.W., Cheong, O., Golin, M., Van Oostrum, R., Competitive facility location: The Voronoi game (2004) Theoretical Computer Science, 310 (1), pp. 457-467; Plastria, F., Vanhaverbeke, L., Discrete models for competitive location with foresight (2008) Computers and Operations Research, 35 (3), pp. 683-700; Alekseeva, E., Kochetova, N., Kochetov, Y., Plyasunov, A., (2010) Heuristic and Exact Methods for the Discrete (r∥ P)-centroid Problem//Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 11-22. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Shiode, S., Yeh, K., Hsia, H., Optimal location policy for three competitive facilities (2012) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 62 (3), pp. 703-707; Glover, F., Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelligence (1986) Computers and Operations Research, 13 (5), pp. 533-549","Qi, M.-Y.; Division of Logistics and Transportation, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua UniversityChina; email: qimy@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn","Kacem I.","","Universite de Lorraine","45th International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering, CIE 2015","28 October 2015 through 30 October 2015",,118692,,,,,"English","Proc. - CIE: Int.

To develop the study, a questionnaire with 196 variables classified into 5 areas was elaborated: Technological innovations, commodities for biodegradable polymers production, commodities for biodegradable packaging production, additives and technologies, the questionnaire was sent to 92 national and international people with knowledge on the topic. The expert panel was made up of 30 people who gave response to the questionnaire for three rounds. According to statistical analysis raised, in the first round, 51 priority variables and 140 variables under discussion were obtained, the 5 variables remaining were classified as non-priority. In the third round, a total of 78 prioritized variables were obtained. The results obtained in the area of technological innovations, natural coatings, active packaging and smart packaging, were considered priorities during the three rounds. In the area of commodities for the production of biodegradable polymers, the potato, cassava and corn starch were considered a priority, in addition to Agroindustrial wastes and in the technology area, reactive extrusion, blow molding and extrusion injection molding were kept for three rounds as priority variables.","Biodegradable packaging; Consensus percentage; Delphi methodology; Foresight",,,,,,"Balaraman, S., Venkatakrishnan, K., Identifying Engineering Education goals and priorities for the future: an experiment with the Delphi technique (1980) Higher Education.

Atherton is concerned with a single but very important facet of the behavior of labor unions-the ways in which their bargaining objectives are determined. He begins by reviewing the existing literature and briefly sketches the conceptual structure of the union. The analysis starts with a theory whose form and substance are close to existing theories, and then is altered by adding unfamiliar elements. An eclectic ""economic"" model is built with two provisional assumptions: complete internal homogeneity of preferences about bargaining objectives, and perfect knowledge and foresight of everything relevant to the attainment of these objectives. The main innovation at this stage is the inclusion of anticipated strike length as a variable which affects union preferences of goals to be pursued. In Chapter IV the first provisional assumption is dropped and the model becomes ""politico-economic."" Allowance is made for diversity of goals within the union and for the leaderships' concern to stay in office. The theory is then restated in axiomatic terms, enabling the author to dispense with the second assumption, that of the union's perfect knowledge and foresight. The theory is now adapted to deal with a union faced with probabilities rather than certainties, and additional adaptations deal with the effect of internal threats to the leaders' control of the organization. © 1973 by Princeton University Press.

By using a case study of a multinational chemical company, the authors intend to show how global organizations use scenario planning as part of their strategic planning processes. Concentrating on scenario planning for regional strategies, the authors want to contribute to best practice of scenario methodology and ideally inspire academic research. Design/methodology/approach – Reviewing the literature of scenario planning and strategy elaboration, the authors focus on the Hax strategy process of strategy formation, as been applied in the case study’s company. They explain the scenario creation process in detail using a concrete example of India. The outcomes of the scenario creation process are then linked to the Hax strategy process’s description, to identify where scenario planning has created concrete value. Finally, the authors describe lessons learnt and list best practices for practitioners. Findings – Based on the analysis, the authors argue that scenario processes add value when embedded in established strategic planning processes. Lessons learned include among others that it is beneficial that the participants creating the scenarios are also those who join the strategy elaboration and that significant effort needs to go into systematically translating scenarios into implications for the organization.

We deal with the issue of non-fundamentalness due to fiscal foresight by appealing to sums of revisions of expectations of fiscal expenditures. This measure of anticipated fiscal shocks is shown to carry valuable information about future dynamics of public spending. Results based on generalised impulse responses suggest that fiscal spending multipliers in recessions are greater than one, but not statistically larger than those in expansions.

Several approaches exist for the conduction of studies sought to make this estimation reliable. We distinguish the classical prospective approach, based on works of French philosopher Gaston Berger and approaches combining the works of G. Altshuller with the theory of logistic growth curves.

The possibility that it could become a dual carriageway was considered. It was designed so it could be easily widened in order to increase its capacity. The same principle was applied to all the structures in that section of the highway. Among them, there are two singular ones: San Timoteo and Canero viaducts, a record in Spain’s push launched bridges because of the length of its spans. In 2003, Acciona Ingeniería co-designed the widening of that section of the highway, carrying out the happy foresight decided years ago.

An artificial beetle could gather and relay data and images from compromised environments on earth and other planets to decision makers. It could also be used for surveillance of foes and friends alike, and will require ethical foresight and oversight. What would it take to develop an artificial beetle? Several biotemplating techniques can be harnessed for the replication of external structural features of beetle bodies, and thus preserve functionalities such as coloration of the exoskeleton and the hydrophobicity of wings. The body cavity must host a power supply, motors to move the wings for flight, sensors to capture ambient conditions and images, and data transmitters and receivers to communicate with a remote command center. All of these devices must be very small and reliable. © 2015 SPIE.","Artificial beetle; Bioreplication; Communication; Exoskeleton; Flight control; Hydrophobicity; Imaging optics; Power supply","Communication; Decision making; Hydrophobicity; Artificial beetle; Bioreplication; Exoskeleton; Flight control; Imaging optics; Power supply; Biomimetics",,,,,"Béthoux, O., The earliest beetle identified (2009) Journal of Paleontology, 83, pp. 931-937; Grove, S.J., Stork, N.E., An inordinate fondness for beetles (2000) Invertebrate Taxonomy, 14, pp. 733-739; Hunt, T., Bergsten, J., Levkanicova, Z., Papadopoulou, A., St. John, O., Wild, R., Hammond, P.M., Vogler, A.P., A comprehensive phylogeny of beetles reveals the evolutionary origins of a superradiation (2007) Science, 318, pp. 1913-1916; Seago, A.E., Brady, P., Vigneron, J.-P., Schultz, T.D., Gold bugs and beyond: A review of iridescence and structural colour mechanisms in beetles (Coleoptera) (2009) Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 6, pp. S165-S184; Stevens, M., Merilaita, S., Defining disruptive coloration and distinguishing its functions (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 364, pp. 481-488; Bar-Cohen, Y., (2006) Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, USA; Lakhtakia, A., Martín-Palma, R.J., (2013) Engineered Biomimicry], , Elsevier Waltham, MA, USA; Lilienthal, O., (1911) Birdflight As the Basis of Aviation: A Contribution Towards A System of Aviation, , Longmans & Green London, United Kingdom; February 9, 1990: Death of George de Mestral (2004) APS News, 13 (2), p. 2; Autumn, K., Gravish, N., Gecko adhesion: Evolutionary nanotechnology (2008) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 366, pp. 1575-1590; Hawkes, E.W., Eason, E.V., Christensen, D.L., Cutkosky, M.R., Human climbing with efficiently scaled gecko-inspired dry adhesives (2015) Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 12, p. 20140675; Dutta, P.K., Dutta, J., Tripathi, V.S., Chitin and chitosan: Chemistry, properties and applications (2004) Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research, 64, pp. 20-31; Rinaudo, M., Chitin and chitosan: Properties and applications (2006) Progress in Polymer Science, 31, pp. 603-632; Dushkina, N., Lakhtakia, A., (2013) Structural Colors, , Lakhtakia, A., and Martín-Palma, R.

To weaken this assumption, a class of games (called games with short sight) was proposed in literature, modelling the game scenarios where players have only limited foresight of the game tree due to bounded resources and limited computational ability. As a consequence, the notions of equilibria in classical game theory were refined to fit games with short sight. A crucial issue that thus arises is to determine whether a strategy profile is a solution for a game. To study this issue and address the underlying idea and theory on players’ decisions in such games, we adopt a logical way. Specifically, we develop a logic through which features of these games are demonstrated. More importantly, it enables us to characterize the solutions of these games via formulas of this logic. This work not only provides an insight into a more realistic model in game theory, but also enriches the possible applications of logic. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Dynamic logic; Extensive games; Short sight; Solution concept","Computation theory; Data privacy; Forestry; Multi agent systems; Network security; Trees (mathematics); Classical game theory; Computational ability; Dynamic logic; Extensive games; Logical characterization; Realistic model; Short sight; Solution concepts; Game theory",,,,,"van Benthem, J., Modal Logic for Open Minds (2010) Center for the Study of Language and Information Lecture Notes, , Stanford University; van Benthem, J., Pacuit, E., Roy, O., Toward a theory of play: A logical perspective on games and interaction (2011) Games, 2 (1), pp. 52-86; Blackburn, P., de Rijke, M., Venema, Y., (2001) Modal Logic, , Cambridge University Press; Bonanno, G., Magill, M., Van Gaasback, K., (2003) Branching Time Logic, Perfect Information Games and Backward Induction, , Working Papers 9813, University of California, Davis, Department of Economics; Cui, J., Luo, X., Sim, K.M., A new epistemic logic model of regret games (2013) KSEM 2013.

Plato represents the demiurge as being guided by his own planning or calculation (logismos: Tim. 30b, 34a-b) about how to bring about maximally good order in the cosmos he produces. Indeed, it seems that the demiurge’s causal power with respect to our cosmos is labelled ‘foresight’ or ‘providence’ (pronoia: Tim. 30b-c) precisely to reflect the claim that benevolent divine planning is explanatory of various features of the physical world. Among Platonists of the early empire, planning was widely understood (on Plato’s authority) to be an integral aspect of the demiurge’s creative activity. Plotinus, however, dissents sharply from the earlier Platonist tradition on this point. He argues that divine reason (nous) cannot make plans of any sort concerning the physical cosmos, or indeed entertain any thoughts whatsoever about physical realities. This leaves Plotinus with the challenge of developing an alternative account of how divine intellectual activity determines and guarantees-as he affirms it does-a ‘providentially’ optimal world order. The bulk of this chapter will discuss Plotinus’ case against the view that the cosmos is the product of demiurgic planning and the alternative account of divine providence that he proposes in that view’s stead. But it will be useful to begin by briefly focusing attention on the picture of divine planning presented in the Timaeus, because Plotinus’ dissenting story about providence can plausibly be taken to be motivated by a desire to resolve tensions internal to Platonism that arise in connection with this picture. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107447974; 9781107061538,,,"English","Causation and Creation in Late Antiquity",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952762251

The producer plays an essential role in filmmaking, as they provide the funding required to turn out quality blockbusters for cinemagoers. Film production is a risky business, as illustrated by the examples of films that fail to cover costs every year. In this respect, tools capable of predicting movie profitability are of potential use to producers as a decision-making tool for deciding whether or not to produce a movie project. In this paper we report a study using historical data on over 100 films produced in the United States (including their genre, opening month, duration, budget, etc.). Decision trees were extracted from these data in order to forecast whether or not a film will be profitable even before it is produced. Decision trees are models commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence as decision support tools. The results show that the resulting model forecasts whether or not a movie will be profitable with an accuracy of over 70%, and this model can be used as a decision support tool for film producers. The proposed approach is not designed to be used as a standalone tool; it should rather round out other forecasting methods, including producers' foresight and judgement. The approach presented here could be equally applicable to other branches of the entertainment business, such as the music or video game industries.","Data mining; Decision Support Systems; Decision trees; Movie industry; Movie profitability prediction","Artificial intelligence; Automatic teller machines; Budget control; Data mining; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Forestry; Motion pictures; Profitability; Trees (mathematics); Decision making tool; Decision support tools; Entertainment industry; Film production; Forecasting methods; Historical data; Movie industry; Video game industry; Decision trees; Algorithms; Decision Making; Market Research; Profitability",,,,,"Pascal, B., Pensées, p. 1662. , Baltimore-Penguin Books; Fayyad, U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview (1996) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1-34. , eds.

In reality, decision-makers do not have perfect foresight, and the endogenous driving force of technology adoption is uncertain. With a stylized optimization model, this paper explores the adoption of a new technology, its associated cost dynamics, and technological bifurcations with limited foresight and uncertain technological learning. The study shows that when modeling with limited foresight and technological learning, (1) the longer the length of the decision period, the earlier the adoption of a new technology, and the value of a foresight can be amplified with a high learning rate. However, when the decision period is beyond a certain length, further extending its length has little influence on adopting the new technology; (2) with limited foresight, decisions aiming at minimizing the total cost of each decision period will commonly result in a non-optimal solution from the perspective of the entire decision horizon; and (3) the range of technological bifurcation is much larger than that with perfect foresight, but uncertainty in technological learning tends to reduce the range by removing the early adoption paths of a new technology. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The expression of libido by an individual is indeed subject to a great number of factors, such as bull to cow ratio, number of bulls in a bull battery, behavioral tendencies, breeding experience, being overweight, climatic effects, and breed.

It focuses on foresight workshops as a means of opening up the foresight processes and enabling collaborative action. The chapter first introduces the basic procedure of foresight workshops. Then, it lays out the different stages in which a company can open up the foresight process and reasons why this pays off. The chapter also discusses pitfalls that companies must avoid in order to fully seize upon the potential of open foresight processes. It explains how to successfully plan and carry out an open foresight process. Finally, the chapter provides some thoughts on the use of open foresight workshops for opportunity identification. Various examples show how companies like Siemens, Greiner Perfoam, or Volkswagen implemented open foresight workshops and benefited from the positive effects of integrating external partners in their foresight processes. © 2014 Product Development and Management Association.

GTECH also continuously looks for ways to improve plant operations. At its Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada, facility, for example, the company recently replaced its method of tracking production and product quality. The production of a gaming machine starts with downloading a work order and the bill of materials (BOM) from an enterprise resource planning system, which then schedules and releases parts to production based on priority, part availability and other factors.

We assume a piecewise linear money demand function, decreasing over a normal range (-a R, a L) and constant when the expected inflation rate is beyond these bounds. In this way, we obtain that the monetary dynamics are described by a one-dimensional map having two kink points. We show that when the slope of the money demand function (μ) is sufficiently large in absolute value and the speed of adjustment of the price to the market disequilibrium (α) is smaller than 1 either cycles of any period or chaotic dynamics may be generated by the model.

The idea of succession planning needs to be included in the long-range plan. Strategic planning grows from a strong mission and vision and, in this case, implementing succession planning as a value. By employing some foresight in the development of policy, an environment supporting succession planning is created. Becoming part of the process and gaining a support network with resources are important aspects of this discussion. Assessment of the current situation and considering the structure of the library also come into play. Creating a strategic plan that involves succession planning is the goal. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Ammons-Stephens, S., Cole, H.J., Developing core leadership competences for the library profession (2009) Library Leadership and Management, 23 (2), pp. 63-74;

This study explores the use of oil-in-water MNP emulsions to achieve mixing in a nonmagnetic continuous phase tantamount to that occurring in equivalent dilute ferrofluid suspensions. To assess the technique, measurements of the torque exerted by ferrofluid emulsions and suspensions of equal magnetic content were performed in rotating, oscillating, and static magnetic fields. Results show that momentum transfer is fairly alike in amplitude and proportionality for the two types of systems of equal magnetic content under the three types of magnetic fields. This implies that momentum of spinning nanoparticles in the emulsions is transferable to the oil droplets containing them which, in return is then transferred to surrounding nonmagnetic liquid. The magnitude of the resulting mixing allows for the foresight of a versatile MNP mixing technology completely separated from the target phase being mixed. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Emulsion; Ferrofluid; Magnetic nanoparticle; Mixing; Process intensification; Torque measurement",,,,,,"McTague, J.P., Magnetoviscosity of magnetic colloids (1969) J Chem Phys., 51, pp. 133-136; Odenbach, S., (2002) Magnetoviscous Effects in Ferrofluids, , Berlin, Germany: Springer; Lu, A.H., Salabas, E.L., Schueth, F., Magnetic nanoparticles: synthesis, protection, functionalization, and application (2007) Angew Chem Int Ed., 46, pp. 1222-1244; Zhu, Y., Stubbs, L.P., Ho, F., Liu, R., Ship, C.P., Maguire, J.A., Hosmane, N.S., Magnetic nanocomposites: a new perspective in catalysis (2010) ChemCatChem., 2, pp. 365-374; Polshettiwar, V., Luque, R., Fihri, A., Zhu, H., Bouhrara, M., Bassett, J.M., Magnetically recoverable nanocatalysts (2011) Chem Rev., 111, pp. 3036-3075; Zeng, T., Yang, L., Hudson, R., Song, G., Moores, A.R., Li, C.J., Fe3O4 nanoparticle-supported copper(I) pybox catalyst: magnetically recoverable catalyst for enantioselective direct-addition of terminal alkynes to imines (2011) Org Lett., 13, pp. 442-445; Rosensweig, R.E., (1997) Ferrohydrodynamics, , Mineola, New York: Dover Publications; Odenbach, S., Gilly, H., Taylor vortex flow of magnetic fluids under the influence of an azimuthal magnetic field (1996) J Magn Magn Mater., 152, pp. 123-128; Odenbach, S., Stork, H., Shear dependence of field-induced contributions to the viscosity of magnetic fluids at low shear rates (1998) J Magn Magn Mater., 183, pp. 188-194; Rinaldi, C., Gutman, F., He, X.W., Rosenthal, A.D., Zahn, M., Torque measurements on ferrofluid cylinders in rotating magnetic fields (2005) J Magn Magn Mater., 289, pp. 307-310; Soto-Aquino, D., Rinaldi, C., Transient magnetoviscosity of dilute ferrofluids (2011) J Magn Magn Mater., 323, pp. 1319-1323; Hajiani, P., Larachi, F., Reducing Taylor dispersion in capillary laminar flows using magnetically excited nanoparticles: nanomixing mechanism for micro/nanoscale applications (2012) Chem Eng J., 203, pp. 492-498; Hajiani, P., Larachi, F., Controlling lateral nanomixing and velocity profile of dilute ferrofluid capillary flows in uniform stationary, oscillating and rotating magnetic fields (2013) Chem Eng J., 223, pp. 454-466; Bibette, J., Monodisperse ferrofluid emulsions (1993) J Magn Magn Mater., 122, pp. 37-41; Montagne, F., Mondain-Monval, O., Pichot, C., Mozzanega, H., Elaissari, A., Preparation and characterization of narrow sized (o/w) magnetic emulsion (2002) J Magn Magn Mater., 250, pp. 302-312; Becher, P., (1965) Emulsions: Theory and Practice, , New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation; Aronson, M.P., The role of free surfactant in destabilizing oil-in-water emulsions (1989) Langmuir., 5, pp. 494-501; Bibette, J., Roux, D., Nallet, F., Depletion interactions and fluid-solid equilibrium in emulsions (1990) Phys Rev Lett., 65, pp. 2470-2473; Bibette, J., Depletion interactions and fractionated crystallization for polydisperse emulsion purification (1991) J Colloid Interface Sci., 147, pp. 474-478; Chantrell, R.W., Popplewell, J., Charles, S.W., Measurements of particle-size distribution parameters in ferrofluids (1978) IEEE Trans Magn., 14, pp. 975-977","Faïçal, L.; Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Laval University, 1065, Avenue de la Médecine, QC, Quebec G1V 0A6, Canada; email: faical.larachi@gch.ulaval.ca",,,,,,,,00011541,,AICEA,,"English","AIChE J.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894043592

Motives behind the selection of foresight methods, the timing involved in using insights from foresight studies in strategic policy-making processes, the added value of foresight methods, and the barriers and leverage points experienced by policy-makers are described and compared at the local and the national level. Different insights are related to different activities in the policy cycle, i.e., agenda-setting, policy preparation, decision-making, implementation, and evaluation. In most evaluative studies on foresight, the added value is addressed from a 'supply-driven' point of view, by which we mean from the point of view of experts on the production or methodology of foresight studies. In this paper, the evaluation is approached from a demand-driven perspective, in other words, from a user perspective - i.e., that of policy-makers who have applied the results of foresight methods in policy-making processes. The insights presented in this paper are based on recent policy document analyses, in-depth interviews, and questionnaire research involving users in the local and national policy domain. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Dutch government; Foresight; Local; National; Policy; Scenarios; Users","decision making; government relations; policy analysis; policy implementation; policy making; Netherlands",,,,,"Hines, A., Bishop, B., (2006) Thinking About the Future.

He also catalogued all of the sites and recorded orientations (Ruggles 1984). The present study assessed 29 of 32 standing stone sites on Mull for possible precise alignments using indicated foresight features. In 1967 Thom published a histogram of some 300 declinations from widely scattered sites (Thom 1967, Fig 8.1). The histogram showed a pattern of peaks that suggested systematic observation of the sun. Thom deduced probable declinations for the peaks. Eleven sites on Mull could not be measured (due to trees, fallen stones, etc.). Three sites were not visited (two had fallen stones). Five others are probably medieval waymarkers. Four sites gave lunar alignments. The remaining nine sites gave multiple solar alignments which strongly supported Thom’s deduced declinations and hence the probable existence of a prehistoric calendar. Mention is made of a recent paper which gives supporting evidence (MacKie 2013). © 2014 MAA Printed in Greece.

Although there are some examples of a future orientation, a systematic futures perspective has not been developed. Building on futures studies (including predictive studies on foresight and design and architecture studies), the authors propose a methodological model for future-sensitive practical theology, accounting for the probable, possible, and preferable. The model results in three modes in which practical theology can employ a future orientation: utopian, prognostic-adaptive, and designing-creative. © UV/UFS.","Futures studies; Methodology; Practical theology; Research",,,,,,"Adam, B., Memory of Futures (2004) Krono Scope, 4 (2), pp. 297-315; Beck, U., (1986) Risikogesellschaft.

In the article, three major traditions of business research (theory of creative destruction, OLC/LCC theory and business war gaming framework) are elaborated and linked to the studies of pirate entrepreneurship. These theoretical approaches help to link the issue of pirate entrepreneurship to foresight research. The key conclusion of the research is that probably new forms of dynamic pirate entrepreneurship can provide new solutions to the triple challenge problem of innovation management, i.e., problems related to creative destruction, disruptive innovations, and creative accumulation. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Business war gaming; Creative accumulation; Disruptive innovation; Dynamic capabilities; Knowledge brokering; Life cycle theory; Pirate entrepreneurship; Schumpeterian theory of creative destruction; Triple challenge of knowledge management",,,,,,"Anderson, P., Tushman, M.I., Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: A cyclical model of technical change (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (4), pp. 604-633; Ansoff, H.I., (1979) Strategic Management, , Macmillan London; Ansoff, H.I., (1990) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice Hall, International, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Bergek, A., Berggren, C., Magnusson, T., Creative accumulation: Integrating new and established technologies in periods of discontinuous change (2011) Knowledge Integration and Innovation.

Clarke regarded the cosmological argument (in a form that incorporates the ontological argument) as essential to prove the uniqueness, eternity, infinity, and omnipresence of God and the design argument as essential to prove the wisdom and foresight of God. The criticisms Hume makes all depend on his empiricist theory of ideas and his revolutionary theories of causation and causal reasoning. Most of the chapter discusses these themes. The concluding section draws attention to recent research that shows two things. One is how central to Hume’s whole philosophical enterprise is his rejection of theological ideas and doctrines. The other is how this relates to his rejection of certain parts of Newtonian metaphysics. © Oxford University Press 2016.

In this paper, the roadmapping process is split into different steps in order to analyse which text mining methods could add further value within each. This leads to a two-layered process model, which includes text mining techniques to systematically integrate external information in ongoing roadmapping processes. Textual data can be used for a structured analysis and exploration of thematic fields and an objective, quantitative summary of actual developments. To demonstrate some of the benefits, the field of ""cloud computing"" is used to illustrate the procedure.

Data for innovation management and policy must be valid, reliable, relevant and actionable.Design and approach–The paper examines trends within finance, environment and institutions and society, all with regard to innovation and technology. It examines how these trends interact with each other and with measurement of innovation and socio-technical change.Findings–In the future, measurement for innovation policy must occur in markedly different ways – and on quite different scales – than is currently the practice. The paper concludes with a future-oriented list of items to be measured, with preliminary guidelines on how to organize to measure them.Research limitations/implications–Foresight researchers must put new emphasis on measurement.Practical implications–Local and national statistical agencies will have to measure new indicators and organize differently to measure them.Social implications–Voters may be eager to embrace principles and goals, though they fail to find excitement in the more tedious issues of measurement. It is incumbent on us to pay more attention to measurement, to resist governments’ and lobbyists’ efforts to introduce special-interest bias into public statistics, and to carry the story to the public of the importance of measurement. Much of the policy change that is now needed is needed because of past and current harmful human behaviors. Nicholas Sarkozy (Press 2011) concisely stated the rationale for this paper: “We will not change our behavior unless we change the ways we measure”.Originality/value–This concept paper goes beyond other indexes and proposals to identify new phenomena that must be measured. In contrast to other works which are oriented to measurement-push (toward policy), the present paper makes bold assertions about the trends needing to be addressed by policy, then proposes measurement based on policy-pull. It argues against premature worldwide statistical standards, and for Popperian “multiple engineering experiments”.

Not that the facts reported or the assumptions put forward were entirely unpredictable or unknown; but they prompted the experts, followed by the various audiences to whom the results were presented, to consider the actions to be undertaken from a different point of view, primarily in relation to the type of future wished for—or not—in the decades to come. The value of baseline scenarios is not that they predict a sure future—which no one can actually anticipate as far ahead as 2050—but that they define the narrow path of possible futures that are likely to unfold if we fail to broaden our options now. Alternative scenario(s) can thus be mobilised to identify the objectives that we need to set when broadening the options explored. This has been the role of the Agrimonde 1 scenario, in contrast to the baseline scenario provided by Agrimonde GO. © Éditions Quæ, 2014.",,,,,,,,"Hubert, B.; Agropolis international, Cedex 5, France; email: bernard.hubert@avignon.inra.fr",,,"Springer Netherlands",,,,,,9789401787451; 9789401787444,,,"English","Agrimonde - Scenarios and Challenges for Feeding the World in 2050",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948137826

Furthermore we set the scenarios in a broader context of new modes of mobility. The power of scenarios consists in the ability to challenge dominating paradigms.

Once these specifications are provided, the flights must proceed along their routes with such speed profiles that every pair of aircraft complies with the minimal separation requirement imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration. The task of separation assurance is most challenging in terminal airspace, with many routes merging and crossing. This paper contributes a mathematical model and an algorithmic approach for routing flights strategically, with a foresight that potentially helps the subsequent computation of speed profiles compliant with the separation requirements and with each aircraft's feasible speed range. The approach consists of reducing a general routing problem to the shortest-path problem. © 2012 by Data Fusion& Neural Networks.",,"Air transportation; Mathematical models; Separation; Specifications; Algorithmic approach; Federal Aviation Administration; Flight navigation; General routing problem; Separation assurances; Shortest path problem; Terminal airspace; Transportation system; Aircraft",,,,,"Isaacson, D.R., Sadovsky, A.V., Davis, D., Scheduling for precision air traffic operations: Problem definition and review of prior research NASA, , (to be published); Papadimitriou, C.H., Steiglitz, K., (1998) Combinatorial Optimization; Algorithms and Complexity, , Dover, New York, Sec.

It aims to show that Walzer is mistaken in reserving this concept, as well as the associated notion of dirty hands, for situations in which political communities, in a desperate struggle for survival, cannot help but kill innocents intentionally, rather than merely with foresight. If moral agents have moral reasons to proceed in a way which will foreseeably result in innocent people being killed, they are already facing a supreme emergency; the killing does not need to be intentional in some narrower sense for that to be the case. This article stays agnostic on whether or not war can be morally justified in principle, and also on whether or not a dirty hands conception of war is ultimately defensible. It merely argues that if there are supreme emergencies as Walzer describes them, then situations in which war can justifiably be waged are, and ought to be, such emergencies. © The Author(s) 2013.","Collateral damage; Dirty hands; Just war theory; Michael Walzer; Supreme emergency",,,,,,"Art, R., Betts, R.K., Copeland, D.C., (2002) War with Iraq is Not in America’s National Interest, , New York Times, 26 September; Bennett, J., Morality and consequences (1981) The Tanner Lectures on Human Values, 2, pp. 46-116. , McMurrin S (ed.), Salt Lake City, UT: University of Utah Press; Coates, A.J., (1997) The Ethics of War, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Gowans, C.W., (1994) Innocence Lost: An Examination of Inescapable Moral Wrongdoing, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Lefkowitz, D., Collateral damage (2008) War: Essays in Moral Philosophy, pp. 145-164. , May L (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Lichtenberg, J., War, innocence, and the doctrine of double effect (1994) Philosophical Studies, 74 (3), pp. 347-368; Luban, D., The romance of the nation-state (1980) Philosophy & Public Affairs, 9 (4), pp. 392-397; McIntyre, A., Doing away with double effect (2001) Ethics, 111 (2), pp. 219-255; McMahan, J., (2009) Killing in War, , Oxford: Clarendon Press; Nardin, T., (1983) Law, Morality and the Relations of States, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Orend, B., (2006) The Morality of War, , Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press; Scanlon, T., (2008) Moral Dimensions: Permissibility, Meaning, Blame, , Cambridge; London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; Steinhoff, U., (2007) On the Ethics of War and Terrorism, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Steinhoff, U., Debate: Jeff McMahan on the moral equality of combatants (2008) Journal of Political Philosophy, 14 (4), pp. 220-226; Toner, C., Just war and the supreme emergency exemption (2005) Philosophical Quarterly, 55 (221), pp. 545-561; Toner, C., The logical structure of just war theory (2010) The Journal of Ethics, 14 (2), pp. 81-102; Walzer, M., Political action: The problem of dirty hands (1973) Philosophy & Public Affairs, 2 (2), pp. 160-180; Walzer, M., (2004) Arguing about War Yale.

In this paper, I formulate and defend an answer to two questions that have not yet been discussed in the literature on exculpatory ignorance. First, which kinds of propositional attitudes that count as ignorance provide an excuse? I argue that we need to consider four options here: having a false belief, suspending judgement on a true proposition, being deeply ignorant of a truth, and having a true belief that falls short of knowledge. Secondly, ignorance of which propositions counts as an excuse? I discuss four candidates: ignorance of one's obligation, ignorance that one is able to meet that obligation, ignorance of how to meet that obligation, and lack of foresight regarding that obligation. I argue that we can give a satisfactory account of exculpatory ignorance only if we pay attention to these two neglected issues. © 2014 The Author 2014.

The LSA concept aims at improving spectrum usage efficiency by introducing additional licensed spectrum users on spectrum bands whose incumbent use would permit it, while guaranteeing certain quality of service (QoS) for all users. The LSA concept could help mobile network operators (MNOs) to gain access to new spectrum bands on a shared basis in a timely manner. As the LSA concept is based on voluntariness, it needs to provide incentives for the incumbent spectrum users for the introduction of sharing. Using a foresight approach called integral scenario methodology, we propose a set of scenarios for incumbent spectrum users in LSA based on their business focus (defensive vs. aggressive) and mode of change (open vs. closed). The created scenarios are described and analyzed from regulation, business and technology perspectives, highlighting the business potential created by the introduction of LSA. The evaluation of the developed business scenarios indicates that a defensive approach for the business focus for incumbents might be preferred to focus narrowly on traditional business models. However, an aggressive approach to pursue new business opportunities with LSA might open up new opportunities which, today, cannot yet be foreseen. © 2014 ICST.","Business Scenarios; Licensed Shared Access; LSA; Spectrum sharing","Cognitive radio; Quality of service; Business models; Business opportunities; Business scenario; Licensed Shared Access; LSA; Mobile network operators; Spectrum sharing; Spectrum usage; Wireless networks",,,,,"(2013) Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation, , Presidential Memorandum, The White House, June; (2011) Assessment of the Global Mobile Broadband Deployments and Forecasts for International Mobile Telecommunications, , Report ITU-R M. 2243; (2013) European Commission Radio Spectrum Policy Group RSPG13-538 Opinion on Licensed Shared Access, , Brussels.

The goal of the project is to develop web based tools which automatically detect activity and trends regarding given keywords. This knowledge can be used to enable decision makers to react proactively to arising challenges. As for now we can detect trends worldwide in more than 60 languages and assign these trends accordingly to over 100 national states. To reach this goal we utilize the big search engines as their core competence is to determine the relevance of a document regarding the search query. The search engines allows slicing of the results by language and country. In the next step we download some of the proposed documents for analysis. Because of the amount of information required we reach the field of Big Data. Therefore an extra effort is made to ensure scalability of the application. We introduce a new approach to activity and trend detection by combining the data collection and detection methods. To finally detect trends in the gathered data we use data mining methods which allow us to be independent from the language a document is written in. The input of these methods is the text data of the downloaded documents and a specially prepared index structure containing meta data and various other information which accumulate during the collection of the documents. We show that we can reliably detect trends and activities in highly active topics and discuss future research. © Jan Stutzki.","Information retrieval; Trend detection; Web mining","Data mining; Information retrieval; Search engines; Amount of information; Core competence; Data collection; Data mining methods; Decision makers; Detection methods; Trend detection; Web Mining; Big data",,,,,"Wangberg, S.C., Relations between Internet use, socio-economic status (SES), social support and subjective health (2008) Health Promotion International, 23 (1), pp. 70-77; (2011) Internet World Stats, , Miniwatts Marketing Group. 31 May, accessed 16 April 2014; Manning, C.D., Raghavan, P., Schütze, H., (2008) Introduction to Information Retrieval, , Cambridge university press Cambridge, USA; Sun, Y., Zhuang, Z., Lee, G.C., A large-scale study of robots.

The second is to present material that provides grounds for developing effective responses. Design/methodology/approach-The issue draws on evidence from previous research, economic modelling and a range of other sources to investigate the hypothesis that humanity is heading towards an “overshoot and collapse” future. It further suggests that a useful way of responding is to explore the possibility that the prospect of collapse can be moderated or avoided through a process of “conscious descent.” Findings-The main findings are that a very wide spectrum of policies, actions, strategies and options is available that can and should be used to help us avoid the most disastrous manifestations of “overshoot and collapse.” Yet there are also many barriers and impediments that continue to inhibit effective responses. This means that the process of coming to grips with the “civilisational challenge” will take longer and become increasingly costly. Denialism and short term thinking remain embedded in dominant institutions and mainstream practice. Currently, vastly more is miss-spent on various perverse incentives (e.g. advertising, the funding of denial, fossil fuel subsidies) than on securing the future of civilisation. This can be seen as a consequence of outdated values and inadequate worldviews. Research limitations/implications-The contributions here represent a sample from within a rapidly expanding field of enquiry and action. They should therefore be seen as indicating the need for further high quality investigation, work and action. The main implication is that this process needs to be taken seriously, properly resourced and eventually transformed into a mainstream social project. Originality/value-The papers are contributions to an in-depth understanding of a complex and evolving situation. Their value lies in the fact that greater understanding and a commitment to early action are among the most productive investments available to societies vulnerable to the systemic threats outlined here. As such, the special issue evokes a fundamental tenet of foresight work in general. Or to put this in the words of Bertrand de Jouvenel, “the proof of improvidence lies in falling under the empire of necessity.” © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Civilisational challenge; Conscious descent; Denialism; Limits to growth; Overshoot and collapse; Social project",,,,,,"Bardi, U., (2013) The Limits to Growth Revisited, , Hall, C.A.S.

A common problem when designing standards for education is that a top-down approach is used by the learning technologists that often doesn't take into account recent developments coming from research or the actual practice. This paper examines a particular methodology, processes and tools used for developing a roadmap for the standards community (CEN WS-LT) with application on competency-driven education. A series of models and activities were developed to describe how community requirements are fed into the specification design process and valorized in the standards consensus process. Our roadmapping methodology made extensive use of foresight analysis methods, including visioning, futuring, and gap analysis. In addition, we have used semantic modeling tools for capturing and extending the knowledge and modeling activities of the target group communities. A Special Interest Group was created under the CEN WS-LT workshop umbrella in order to facilitate disagreement management and modeling activities among the groups working in the field.

The heavy burden of uncertainties and emergence of interrupted and wild card events have changed the conditions in a way that future forecasting is not possible for planners. On the other hand, in regional and urban planning it is necessary to change the attitude from forecasting to foresight. Considering this, the paper attempts to introduce the approach of foresight as well as having a critical view of the current process of planning in foreseeing and future studies. Moreover, this study emphasizes the necessity of employing the foresight approach in the process of urban and regional studies.","Foresight; Planning process; Processes re-engineering","engineering; forecasting method; management practice; planning system; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis; urban planning",,,,,"The potential of regional foresight (2002) Final Report of the STRATA-ETAN Expert Group, European Research Area, , ERA; Faludi, A., The planning environment and the meaning of planning (1970) Regional Studies, 4 (1), pp. 1-9; (2001) A Practical Guide to Regional Foresight, , Foren, European Commision Research Directorate General, ESTRATA programme, December; Khazaee, S., (2007) Future Researching: Concepts and Needs, , http://www.ayandehpajoohi.com/archive/00126.php; Lingren, M., (2003) Scenario Planning: The Link between Future and Strategy, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Masumi-Ashkevari, H., (2008) Scientific Guidelines for Planning and Foresight, , Tehran: Payam Press; Mobini-Dehkordi, A., (2008) Mega Dimes as Strategic Need for Offices Futures, , Tehran: International Energy Institute; Myer, D., Kitsuse, A., Construction the future in planning: A survey of theories and tools (2000) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 19 (3), pp. 221-231; Nazemi, A., (2007) Zone Foresight as Land Preparation, , Tehran: Atinegar Idea Center; Nazemi-Ghadiri, A., (2006) Foresight from Concept to Running, , Tehran: New Industries Center; Porter, A..L., (1991) Forecasting and Management of Technology, , New York: Wiley; Schwartz, P., (2008) The Art of Future Vision, , transl.

Adopting a case-based approach, three software companies engaged in four new product development projects served as our empirical research sites. With emphasis placed on their innovation teams' everyday practices, data for the empirical inquiry were collected using the qualitative methods of semistructured interviews, ethnographical observation and project archival documents. Explicating the observed foresightful practices and their underlying activities under the general rubrics of organizing architecture and social co-ordination, we identified over-compartmentalization, over-determinism and (in)congruence-of-values as quintessentially embedded organizing practices, that constitutively enable (or impede) organizational foresightfulness.

This concept of morphogenesis and the concept of embryo pattern formation based on chemical diffusion patterns were corroborated with the discovery of the Homeobox or Hox genes. In the following decades, Hox gene research has expanded and is now shown to underlie the variety of morphological novelties that we experience in nature, the patterning of structural aspects of different organs including the brain and also mutant animals that may in the future give rise to novel speciation. Turing had the foresight and vision and with his work created the field of computational biology and mathematical modeling in biological systems. In this paper, we will discuss the concept of Hox genes, their role in patterning the embryo, how it relates to Turing's concept of morphogenesis and what further insights they may provide. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.","Development; Hox genes; Morphogenesis; Morphological novelties","Chemical diffusion; Computational biology; Computational framework; Development; Hox gene; Morphogenesis; Morphological novelties; Structural aspects; Bioinformatics; Biological systems; Genes; Morphology",,,,,"Bao, A.M., Swaab, D.F., Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relation to gender identity, sexual orientation and neuropsychiatric disorders (2011) Front Neuroendocrinol, 32 (2), pp. 214-226; Carroll, S.B., Endless forms: the evolution of gene regulation and morphological diversity (2000) Cell, 101 (6), pp. 577-580; Carroll, S.B., Evo-devo and an expanding evolutionary synthesis: a genetic theory of morphological evolution (2008) Cell, 134, pp. 25-36; Carroll, S.B., Grenier, J., Weatherbee, S., (2004) From DNA to Diversity: Molecular Genetics and the Evolution of Animal Design, , NY: Wiley; Duboule, D., (1994) Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes, , Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press; Duboule, D., Dollé, P., The structural and functional organization of the murine HOX gene family resembles that of the Drosophila homeotic genes (1989) EMBO J, 8, pp. 1597-1605; Finnerty, J.R., Martindale, M.Q., The evolution of the Hox cluster: insights from outgroups (1998) Curr Opin Genet Dev, 8, pp. 681-687; Foronda, D., De Navas, L.F., Garaulet, D.L., Sánchez-Herrero, E., Function and specificity of Hox genes (2009) Int J Dev Biol, 53 (8-10), pp. 1404-1419. , doi:10.1387/Ijdb.072462df; Gehring, W.J., The homeo box: a key to the understanding of development?

Yet not only does this ignore the nature of national identity, which has been overlooked in the discussion of nationalist development on Cyprus, it also seems to credit the British with too much foresight and control. This article questions whether the development of a Turkish identity within the Muslim population was primarily based on British encouragement. It also argues that Turkish-Cypriot nationalism, rather than being 'late' or 'imposed', emerged similarly to other national identities. As the 1950-1951 attempt to appoint a mufti demonstrates, Turkish-Cypriot leadership appeared in spite of rather than because of the colonial administration. Indeed, the incident shows how British officials misunderstood the desires and concerns of the Turkish Cypriots just as much as they did Greek-Cypriot feelings regarding Enosis. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.",,,,,,,"Akçali, E., Getting Real on Fluctuating National Identities: Insights from Northern Cyprus (2011) Antipode, 43 (5), pp. 1725-1747; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London: Verso; Apeyitou, E., Turkish-Cypriot Nationalism: Its History and Development (1571-1960) (2003) Cyprus Review, 15 (1), pp. 67-98; Ateşin, H.M., The Process of Secularisation of the Turkish Community 1925-1975 (2006) Britain in Cyprus: Colonialism and Post-Colonialism, 1878-2006, pp. 327-342. , In, edited by H.

This model serves as a decision support system within a changing environment, allowing early detection of important business trends. In the first phase, we set the goal of what will be prospected. In the second phase, resources and capabilities are defined. The third phase defines the direction based on prior information. The first control loop is made up, serving as a fast-track feedback making it adaptable to the changing environment. A fourth phase serves to define action plans and measures to achieve the objectives; this stage feeds back to keep the system updated on the progress of measures and actions taken. This model is expected to respond to the following strategic foresight basic questions: what is being sought, where the technologies are, what direction should be taken according to the current environment, and how to get there. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

The chief interest in the Guide will be in the light it shines on the many difficult substantive and procedural issues concerning reservations and declarations left open by the Vienna Conventions. But the institutional aspects are also of considerable practical interest. The present contribution considers some of the institutional or cooperative bodies that may assist practitioners: depositaries; treaty monitoring bodies; the reservations dialogue; and 'mechanisms of assistance'. The first two are well-established. The third and fourth are innovative, and it remains to be seen whether they will be adopted by states and, if so, how useful they will be. In any event, the Special Rapporteur has shown considerable foresight in proposing what became the annex to the Guide to Practice on the reservations dialogue, as well as the Commission's resolution on 'mechanisms of assistance'. © 2013 The Author.

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model consists of eight-steps. For the first step the authors propose two studies: trends analysis and change drivers' identification; these help to identify the most relevant trends in areas that may affect the business activities. All this information is put into a Delphi process with the help of experts in order to find the common denominator of where the future is going; afterwards, with this information, the authors can build events and scenarios for the business opportunities. Then, a diagnostic of the study area, sector or organization through the dynamic diagnostic methods is performed. Findings: Once the opportunities have been identified, a strategic analysis that allows decision making to prioritize and define the activities or projects that may be achievable in the future is done, and the result of the process is a portfolio of business opportunities projects fully defined and ready to be planned with a roadmap. Originality/value: The proposed model allows the managers to consistently organize their development processes targeted to real business opportunities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business opportunity; Change drivers; Delphi; Scenarios; Technology foresight; Technology roadmap; Trends",,,,,,"Bers, J.A., Dismukes, J.P., Miller, L.K., Dubrovensky, A., Accelerated radical innovation: Theory and application (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76 (1), pp. 165-177; Burgelman, R.A., Christensen, C.M., Wheelwright, S.C., (2009) Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation, , McGraw-Hill Irwin, Boston, MA; Chen, P.-T., Cheng, J.Z., Unlocking the promise of mobile value-added services by applying new collaborative business models (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (4), pp. 678-693; Christensen, C.M., (2006) The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business, , HarperBusiness Essentials, New York, NY; Curran, C.-S., Bröring, S., Leker, J., Anticipating converging industries using publicly available data (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (3), pp. 385-395; de Miranda Santo, M., Coelho, G.M., dos Santos, D.M., Filho, L.F., Text mining as a valuable tool in foresight exercises: A study on nanotechnology (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73 (8), pp. 1013-1027; Dismukes, J.P., Miller, L.K., Bers, J.A., Sekhar, J.A., Shelbrooke, A.E., Accelerated radical innovation (ARI) methodology validation (2009) Proc., Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology, PICMET, 2009, pp. 677-691; Fenwick, D., Daim, T.U., Gerdsri, N., Value driven technology road mapping (VTRM) process integrating decision making and marketing tools: Case of internet security technologies (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76 (8), pp. 1055-1077; Glenn, J.C., (2008) Scenario, , The Futures Group, Washington, DC; Godet, M., (1993) De La Anticipación a La Acción: Manual De Prospectiva Y Estrategia, , Barcelona; Gordon, T., 'Cross impact analysis', Futures Research Methodology V3.0 (2009), The Millenium Project; Güemes, D., (2007) Technological Megatrends.

Geostatistical interpolation of non-assay data allows the mine planner to estimate quality parameters regarding mining. The foresight can then be used for more timely and accurate seam blending protocols. This paper discusses the modelling and the spatial variability of three coal parameters, namely calorific value, ash content, and sulphur content, of a coal seam in Malinau, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. It is concluded that the use of the kriging procedure is strongly influenced by the amount of drill-hole data and their areal distribution. The results are more realistic when more drill-hole data are available and the distribution is even. It is thus worthwhile to consider the inclusion of geostatistical methods into mine planning as they can identify the errors associated with large reserve tonnage and quality estimates when used appropriately. The use of these methods could be a good opportunity to enhance mine planning in Indonesia.

These changes in available parallelism have motivated work on adaptive concurrency control mechanisms. Existing adaptation techniques mostly learn about available parallelism indirectly, through runtime monitors that detect pathologies (e.g. excessive retries in speculation or high lock contention in mutual exclusion). We present a novel approach to adaptive parallelization, whereby the effective level of parallelism is predicted directly based on input features, rather than through circumstantial indicators over the execution environment (such as retry rate). This enables adaptation with foresight, based on the input data and not the run prefix. For this, the user specifies input features, which our system then correlates with the amount of available parallelism through offline learning. The resulting prediction rule serves in deployment runs to foresee the available parallelism for a given workload and tune the parallelization system accordingly. We have implemented our approach in TIGHTFIT, a general framework for input-centric offline adaptation. Our experimental evaluation of TIGHTFIT over two adaptive runtime systems and eight benchmarks provides positive evidence regarding TIGHTFIT's efficacy and accuracy.

Clients, however, may need to execute a sequence of operations (a composite operation) atomically. We consider the problem of extending a linearizable library to support arbitrary atomic composite operations by clients. We introduce a novel approach in which the concurrent library ensures atomicity of composite operations by exploiting information (foresight) provided by its clients. We use a correctness condition, based on a notion of dynamic right-movers, that guarantees that composite operations execute atomi-cally without deadlocks, and without using rollbacks. We present a static analysis to infer the foresight information required by our approach, allowing a compiler to automatically insert the foresight information into the client. This relieves the client programmer of this burden and simplifies writing client code. We present a generic technique for extending the library implementation to realize foresight-based synchronization. This technique is used to implement a general-purpose Java library for Map data structures - the library permits composite operations to simultaneously work with multiple instances of Map data structures. We use the Maps library and the static analysis to enforce atomicity of a wide selection of real-life Java composite operations. Our experiments indicate that our approach enables realizing efficient and scalable synchronization for real-life composite operations.

We argue that such an approach is flawed, consigning strategic foresight to a narrow function in a planning perspective. To move the field into more fertile pastures for research, we draw on the practice theoretical lens to provide an alternative viewpoint on strategic foresight as a bundle of everyday organizing practices. In keeping with the practice approach to strategic foresight, we delineate strategic foresight as a continuous and contextual practice of 'wayfinding', that manifest in everyday situated organizing. We offer an integrating framework that contributes to the ongoing discussions about alternative approaches to theorizing strategic foresight. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"corporate strategy; management practice; planning method; prediction",,,,,"Daheim, C., Gereon, U., Corporate foresight in Europe: from trend based logics to open foresight (2008) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 20 (3), pp. 321-336; Rigby, A., Bilodeau, B., A growing focus on preparedness (2007) Harvard Business Review, 85 (7-8), pp. 21-22; Antonacopoulou, E., Strategizing as practising: strategic learning as a source of connection (2010) Handbook of Research on Strategy and Foresight, pp. 169-181. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, L.

This paper offers insight into the basic steps of building and designing wing sets that allow the user foresight into what changes to make in order to gain more wing twist. © 2013 by Jaderic Dawson, Todd Smith, Mervat Elhindi, George Huang.",,"Basic structure; Biologically inspired; Cause-and-effect relationships; Micro aerial vehicle; Wing flapping; Wing set; Wing twist; Aerospace engineering; Carbon fibers; Micro air vehicle (MAV); Automobile manufacture",,,,,"Combes, S.A., Daniel, T.L., Flexural Stiffness in Insect Wings (2003) Journal of Experimental Biology, pp. 2989-2997; Combes, S.A., Daniel, T.L., Flexural Stiffness in Insect Wings I Scaling and the influence of wing venation (2003) Journal of Experimental Biology, pp. 2979-2987; Combes, S.A., Daniel, T.L., Flexural Stiffness in Insect Wings: Effects of Wing Venation and Stiffness Distribution on Passive Bending (2005) American Entomologist, pp. 42-44; Combes, S.A., Daniel, T.L., Shape, Flapping and Flexion: Wing and Fin Design fo Forward Flight (2001) Journal of Experimental Biology, pp. 2073-2085; Cui, E.-J., Zhan, H.-L., Bai, P., Aerodynamic Characteristics, Power Requirements and Camber Effects of the Pitching-Down Flapping Hovering (2009) Journal of Bionic Engineering, 6, pp. 120-134; Doman, D.B., Regisford, S., Wing Sizing, Trim, and Control considerations in the Design of Hover-Capable Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles (2010) AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Conference; Hsu, C., Evans, J., Vytla, S., Huang, P.G., Development of Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles-Design, CFD, Experiment and Acutal Flight (2010) 48th AIAA Aerospace Science Meeting; Kang, C.-K., Aono, H., Cesnik, C.E., Shyy, W., Effects of flexibility on the aerodynamic performance of flapping wings (2011) Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 689, pp. 32-74; Orlowski, C.T., (2011) Flapping WIng Micro Air Vehicles: An Analysis of the Importance of the Mass of the Wings to Flight Dynamics, Stability and Control, , The University of Michigan: Dissertation Paper; Sane, S., Dickenson, M.H., The Control of Flight Force by a Flapping Wing: Lift and Drag Force Production (2001) The Journal of Experimental Biology, pp. 2607-2626; Smith, T.J., Dawson, J.C., Huang, P.G., Doman, D.B., Figure-8 Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicle (2011) AIAA Fluid Dynamics Conference and Exhibit, , Hawaii; Zbikowski, R., Galinski, C., Insect-like flapping wing mechanism based on a double spherical Scotch yoke (2005) Nournal of The Royal Society Interface, 2, pp. 223-235","Department of Mechanical and Material Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH 45435, United States",,"American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)",,"51st AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting including the New Horizons Forum and Aerospace Exposition 2013","7 January 2013 through 10 January 2013","Grapevine, TX",98224,,9781624101816,,,"English","51st AIAA Aerosp.

We show that there are two general classes of steady states within this framework: those where strictly dominated forecasting rules vanish, and those heterogeneous states where a positive proportion of agents uses a more costly perfect foresight. We demonstrate that intrinsic heterogeneity can also arise in a model where the forecasting rules are not equally costly and do not exhibit identical performance in the long run. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive learning; Cobweb model; Heterogeneous expectations; Rational expectations",,,,,,"Anderson, R.D.J., Becker, R., Osborn, D.R., (2010), Heterogeneity in consumers learning about inflation.

Clients, however, may need to execute a sequence of operations (a composite operation) atomically. We consider the problem of extending a linearizable library to support arbitrary atomic composite operations by clients. We introduce a novel approach in which the concurrent library ensures atomicity of composite operations by exploiting information (foresight) provided by its clients. We use a correctness condition, based on a notion of dynamic rightmovers, that guarantees that composite operations execute atomically without deadlocks, and without using rollbacks. We present a static analysis to infer the foresight information required by our approach, allowing a compiler to automatically insert the foresight information into the client. This relieves the client programmer of this burden and simplifies writing client code. We present a generic technique for extending the library implementation to realize foresight-based synchronization. This technique is used to implement a general-purpose Java library for Map data structures - the library permits composite operations to simultaneously work with multiple instances of Map data structures. We use the Maps library and the static analysis to enforce atomicity of a wide selection of real-life Java composite operations. Our experiments indicate that our approach enables realizing efficient and scalable synchronization for real-life composite operations.","Automatic Synchronization; Composition; Concurrency; Data Structures; Transactions","Automatic synchronization; Client code; Concurrency; Correctness conditions; Java library; Multiple instances; Transactions; Wide selection; Chemical analysis; Data structures; Libraries; Static analysis; Synchronization; Concurrency control",,,,,"gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/jsr166/dist/jsr166edocs/jsr166e/ConcurrentHashMapV8. html; docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap. html; www.devdaily.com/java/jwarehouse/apache-tomcat-6.0.16/java/org/apache/el/ util/ConcurrentCache.java.shtml; docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html; guava-libraries.code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/; Jgroups Toolkit, , www.jgroups.org/index.html; Agrawal, D., Abbadi A, E.L., Constrained shared locks for increasing concurrency in databases (1995) Selected Papers of the ACM SIGMOD Symposium on Principles of Database Systems; Bernstein, P.A., Hadzilacos, V., Goodman, N., (1987) Concurrency Control and Recovery in Database Systems, , Addison-Wesley; Bronson, N., (2011) Composable Operations on High-Performance Concurrent Collections, , PhD thesis, Stanford University, Dec; Cascaval, C., Blundell, C., Michael, M., Cain, H.W., Chiras, S., Chatterjee, S., Software transactional memory: Why is it only a research toy?

Operating conditions of such a combination are optimized by Differential Evolution (DE) method to maximize main products yield. In this regard, thirteen and eleven decision variables such as length per diameter (LOD) of the tubular membrane reactor, hydraulic diameter, membrane thickness, catalyst mass distribution, etc. are optimized for a combination of one or two tubular membrane reactors with two or one spherical reactor. Eight possible combinations are optimized. The optimization results show that the configuration of spherical-tubular membrane-spherical reactor (SMS) performs well among all the other ones. A considerable increase in aromatic (8.01%) and hydrogen (9.81%) production rates in addition to desirable pressure and temperature profiles are achieved in optimized SMS configuration. Experiments and cost evaluation of SMS should be supplemented to such a theoretical investigation as a future work to have an entire foresight for future plant designs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using tax policies as a leading example of foresight, simple theory makes transparent the economic behavior and information structures that generate non-fundamental equilibria. Econometric analyses that fail to model foresight will obtain biased estimates of output multipliers for taxes; biases are quantitatively important when two canonical theoretical models are taken as data generating processes. Both the nature of equilibria and the inferences about the effects of anticipated tax changes hinge critically on hypothesized information flows. Different methods for extracting or hypothesizing the information flows are discussed and shown to be alternative techniques for resolving a non-uniqueness problem endemic to moving average representations. © 2013 The Econometric Society.","Anticipated taxes; Identified VARs; News; Non-fundamental representation",,,,,,"Abel, A.B., Dynamic Effects of Permanent and Temporary Tax Policies in a q Model of Investment (1982) Journal of Monetary Economics, 9 (3), pp. 353-373. , DOI: 10.1016/0304-3932(82)90023-X; An, S., Schorfheide, F., Bayesian Analysis of DSGE Models (2007) Econometric Reviews, 26 (2), pp. 113-172. , DOI: 10.1080/07474930701220071; Ang, A., Bhansali, V., Xing, Y., Taxes on Tax-Exempt Bonds (2010) Journal of Finance, 65 (2), pp. 565-601; Auerbach, A.J., Tax Reform and Adjustment Costs: The Impact on Investment and Market Value (1989) International Economic Review, 30 (4), pp. 939-962. , DOI: 10.2307/2526760; Barsky, R., Sims, E., News Shocks and Business Cycles (2011) Journal of Monetary Economics, 58 (3), pp. 273-289. , DOI: 10.1016/j.jmoneco.2011.03.001; Beaudry, P., Portier, F., Stock Prices, News, and Economic Fluctuations (2006) American Economic Review, 96 (4), pp. 1293-1307. , DOI: 10.1257/aer.96.4.1293; Bernanke, B.S., Alternative Explanations of the Money-Income Correlation (1986) Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 25, pp. 49-99; Blanchard, O.J., Perotti, R., An Empirical Characterization of the Dynamic Effects of Changes in Government Spending and Taxes on Output (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (4), pp. 1329-1368. , DOI: 10.1162/003355302320935043; Blanchard, O.J., Quah, D., The Dynamic Effects of Aggregate Demand and Supply Disturbances (1989) American Economic Review, 79 (4), pp. 655-673; Blattner, T., Catenaro, M., Ehrmann, M., Strauch, R., Turunen, J., (2008), ""The Predictability of Monetary Policy,"" Occasional Paper 83, European Central Bank, March; Burnside, C., Eichenbaum, M., Fisher, J.D.M., Fiscal Shocks and Their Consequences (2004) Journal of Economic Theory, 115 (1), pp. 89-117. , DOI: 10.1016/S0022-0531(03)00252-7; Canova, F., (2002), Validating Monetary DSGE Models Through VARs,"" Discussion Paper 3442, Centre for Economic Policy Research, July; Chari, V.V., Kehoe, P.J., McGrattan, E.R., Are Structural VARs With Long-Run Restrictions Useful in Developing Business Cycle Theory?

We suggest that this mystique-the way some managers are perceived by observers-arises from the intuitive logic that psychologists and anthropologists call magical thinking. Consistent with this account, Study 1 found that perceptions of a manager's mystique are associated with judgments of his or her charismatic vision and ability to forecast future business trends. The authors hypothesized that mystique arises especially when success is observed in the absence of mechanical causes, such as long hours or hard-won skills. In Study 2, managers who succeeded mysteriously rather than mechanically evoked participants' attributions of foresight and their expectations of success at visionary tasks yet not at administrative tasks. The authors further hypothesized that as mystique is assumed to spread through contagion, observers desire physical contact with managers who are attributed mystique and with these managers' possessions. Study 3 found that managers described as visionary as opposed to diligent are judged to be charismatic and ultimately magnetic. The authors discuss the implications of these judgment patterns for the literatures on perception biases and impression management in organizations. © The Author(s) 2011.","attribution; contagion; mystique; vision",,,,,,"(2006) Personalities, , http://www.answers.com/topic/lebron-james, Answers.com. n.d, Retrieved December 22,from; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Bass, B.M., (1985) Leadership and Performance beyond Expectations, , New York: Free Press; Bass, B.M., (1988) Charismatic Leadership: The Elusive Factor in Organizational Effectiveness, pp. 40-77. , Conger J.

Reflections on my experience are based on handling field crop breeding and direct contacts with some distinguished plant breeders and some great people managers. By writing this article, I hope to share information on key success factors for developing and releasing new cultivars. The reflections also include other issues that can enable breeders at seed companies to have a competitive edge. The ultimate challenge for a plant breeder is releasing an elite cultivar. The key success factors for a successful crop breeding program are: (i) having a highly capable breeder with adequate technical competency; (ii) understanding the crop and the key customer requirements; (iii) having adequate genetic variability; (iv) having an elite heterotic pattern for hybrid; (v) using the most efficient breeding methodologies; (vi) selecting right breeding environments; (vii) developing an adequate and effective testing system; (viii) speeding to release new hybrids into a market, and recently (ix) having adequate information technology and DNA marker lab support. Close linkage of research and development team with commercial team will ensure breeding directions are aligned with meeting customer requirements. Key success factors for the seed business are: understanding the seed market and key customer requirements, designing right products, producing at reasonable cost, commercializing efficiently, delivering products and services, and providing customer service. Appropriate cultural practices for the new product are needed for clearly delivering superior products. The successful breeder normally gets promotion to be the manager of the research organization and may even get further promotion to an even high-ranking position. Effective delegation skills will be needed for a great people manager. Key competency behaviors for the great people manager are people, leadership and management skills, foresight and initiative, communication and candor, relationships and networks, and results orientation. © Society for the Advancement of Breeding Research in Asia and Oceania (SABRAO) 2013.","Competency behaviors; Competitive edge; Crop breeding; DNA marker fingerprinting; Elite cultivar; Genetic variability; Heterotic pattern; Technical competency",,,,,,"Buchingham, M., Coffman, C., (1999) First break all the rules, , Simon and Schuster Inc.

It describes how joint enterprise has become a specific weapon used by the police and the courts to target both political protest and 'gang' violence, in particular in black and working-class communities. The main evidence and recommendations of the House of Commons Justice Committee inquiry into joint enterprise held in 2011 are summarised, with specific reference to how the complexity and inconsistency in application of the law, its use as a dragnet against gangs through police and prosecutorial over-charging, and convictions based on 'foresight' rather than criminal intent, can all lead to miscarriages of justice. The particular problems associated with the use of joint enterprise in relation to murder are described. The article concludes by examining the response of the UK authorities to the Justice Committee report, with specific reference to new draft prosecutorial guidance issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, which fails to clarify the law and in fact confirms the need for new legislation in this area.

While the relevance of dealing with trends is constantly underlined, the effects of labeling phenomena as trends and megatrends in an organizational context have not been widely discussed. In particular, the dangers of dealing with megatrend semantics are that the strategic implications of these phenomena are unclear and that an organization is likely to increase its blind spots, thereby actually undermining its foresight capability.This paper applies a discourse-theoretical perspective developed by Ernesto Laclau and Chantalle Mouffe to trend management in organizations. It argues that megatrends can be perceived as empty signifiers, as they provide an overdetermined, abstract form of meaning that addresses discourses but cannot convey concrete meaning for management. It is proposed that instead of concentrating on megatrends (empty signifiers), trend management should reconstruct those elements of a discourse in which shifts of meaning can be observed, detecting and understanding the nodal points of a discourse. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Discourse theory; Empty signifier; Megatrends; Nodal points; Trends","detection method; management; organizational framework; strategic approach; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic response in turbulent environments (1982) Working Paper no 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision-making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21, pp. 307-320; Martinet, A.-C., Strategic planning, strategic management, strategic foresight: the seminal work of H.

This method of selling securities had previously been banned by federal securities law but the new CROWDFUND Act overturns that prohibition. This Article introduces the CROWDFUND Act and explains that it can be expected to have two primary effects on securities law and capital markets. First, it will liberate startup companies to use peer networks and the Internet to obtain modest amounts of capital at low cost. Second, it will help democratize the market for financing speculative startup companies and allow investors of modest means to make investments that had previously been offered solely to wealthy, so-called ""accredited"" investors. This Article also offers two predictions as to how securities crowdfunding will play out in practice. First, it predicts that companies that sell equity via crowdfunding may find themselves the subject of hostile takeovers (though the founders of such companies can easily avoid that outcome if they act with a little foresight). Second, it predicts that issuers may prefer to crowdfund debt securities, such as bonds, rather than equity. The Article concludes with a few thoughts on the SEC's implementation of the Act in light of the potential for fraud. © 2013 The University of Notre Dame.",,,,,,,"Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, , Pub.

This chapter presents an approach to identifying the most promising nanoindustry product groups, the technological breakthroughs associated with these, and prospects for emergence of nanotechnology markets. In the Russian context, it suggested that significant niches in these nanotechnology markets can be established, by making an measured choice of priorities and focusing efforts on achieving these. Acting upon such priorities requires coordinated efforts from key actors throughout the life cycle of nanoproducts from development to commercialization, not just in the research phase. We argue that the effectiveness of the measures that are taken will depend on the extent to which recommendations based on Foresight studies are taken on board in management decisions affecting the nascent nanoindustry’s scientific, technological, and market development. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Annual report (2011) (2012) European Photovoltaic Industry Association, , http://www.epia.org/publications/epiapublications.html, Accessed 12 Apr 2012; World in transition -a social contract for sustainability (2011) WBGU, , http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2011-a-social-contract/, 2011, Accessed 14 Mar 2012; (2009), http://eng.thesaurus.rusnano.com/wiki/article1377, Accessed 26 Sept 2012; Gokhberg, L., Fursov, K., Karasev, O., Nanotechnology development and regulatory framework: The case of Russia (2012) Technovation, 32, pp. 161-162. , (in Russian); Roadmap Using Nanotechnology in the production of carbon fibers and related products (2010) Research Study Sponsored by RUSNANO, , http://rusnano.com/ipload/oldnews/files/33652/current.pdf; Karasev, O., Rudnik, P., Sokolov, A., Emerging technology-related markets in Russia: The case of nanotechnology (2011) J East West Bus, 17 (2-3), pp. 101-119; (2010) The recession’s Impact on Nanotechnology, , http://www.luxresearchinc.com/blog/page/16/, Accessed 04 Mar 2012; (2003) Energy Strategy of Russia until 2020, , Russian; (2012) Strategy of the Development of Russia until 2020, , Russian; Technology roadmap.

It is likely that ""peaker"" plants will be a crucial dispatchable resource for compensating for the variations in renewable supply. Thus, it is important to understand the strategic incentives of peaker plants and their potential for exploiting market power due to having responsive supply. To this end, we study an oligopolistic two-settlement market comprising of two types of generation (baseloads and peakers) where there is perfect foresight. We characterize symmetric equilibria in this context via closedform expressions. However, we also show that, when the system is capacity-constrained, there may not exist equilibria in which baseloads and peakers play symmetric strategies. This happens because of opportunities for both types of generation to exploit market power to increase prices. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Control; Base-loads; Closed-form expression; Forward market; Market Power; Perfect foresights; Renewable resource; Commerce",,,,,"Ackermann, T., (2005) Wind Power in Power Systems, 140. , Wiley Online Library; Stoft, S., (2002) Power System Economics, , IEEE press Piscataway, NJ; Harris, C., (2006) Electricity Markets: Pricing, Structures and Economics, 328. , Wiley; Kirschen, D., Strbac, G., (2005) Fundamentals of Power System Economics, , Wiley Online Library; Puga, J.N., The importance of combined cycle generating plants in integrating large levels of wind power generation (2010) The Electricity Journal, 23 (7), pp. 33-44; De Meo, E.A., Jordan, G.A., Kalich, C., King, J., Milligan, M.R., Murley, C., Oakleaf, B., Schuerger, M.J., Accommodating wind's natural behavior (2007) Power and Energy Magazine, 5 (6), pp. 59-67. , IEEE; Smith, J.C., Milligan, M.R., De Meo, E.A., Parsons, B., Utility wind integration and operating impact state of the art (2007) Power Systems, 22 (3), pp. 900-908. , IEEE Transactions on; Corporation, E., Avista corporation wind integration study (2007) Avista Corporation, Tech.

The existence of both institutes was to a great extent facilitated by the foresight of Prof. Pisin Chen, current director of LeCosPA, and we fully envision the vibrant on-going collaboration between the two institutes for the years to come. This presentation highlights the current research direction of KIPAC, including the wide range of programs in particle astrophysics and cosmology. Of the on-going projects, the main current effort at KIPAC is the operation of, and the analysis of data from the Large Area Telescope on-board the space-borne Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which is described in more detail in the article by Prof. Kamae in these proceedings. That article focuses on the instrument, and the results gleaned from observations of our own Galaxy. Here, the second part of this article also includes the highlights for astrophysics of jets emanating from the vicinity of black holes, which are prominent gamma-ray sources detected by Fermi: this is the area of research of the article's author. © 2013 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

It focuses on four texts: Adichie's Purple Hibiscus and Half of a Yellow Sun, and Atta's Everything Good Will Come and Swallow. It argues that such characters represent a growing realisation that Nigerian women are less prepared to bemoan gender injustice than to make conscious efforts to improve their own lives. The notion of superwomanhood is discussed, and the various elements that comprise it are described, including the attainment and maintenance of personal autonomy, the ability to reverse the dynamic of patriarchy, and the development of insight and foresight. The paper also argues that female characters in the texts undergo a ""trajectory of becoming"" on their way to attaining the status of superwomen.","Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Contemporary Nigerian fiction; Female characters; Sefi Atta",,,,,,"Adichie, C.N., (2004) Purple Hibiscus, , Lagos, Nigeria: Kachifo Limited; Adichie, C.N., (2006) Half of a Yellow Sun, , Lagos, Nigeria: Farafina; Atta, S., (2005) Everything Good Will Come, , Lagos, Nigeria: Kachifo Limited; Atta, S., (2008) Swallow, , Lagos, Nigeria: Farafina Books; De Beauvoir, S., The second sex (1998) The Theory of Criticism: From Plato to the Present, pp. 533-536. , R.

As an initial part of this paper we propose two studies: 1) trends analysis and 2) change drivers' identification; these lets us know exactly what are the relevant trends in areas where we want to venture that may affect the business activities. All this information is put into a Delphi process with the help of experts in order to find the common denominator of where the future is going; afterwards, with this information we can build events and scenarios for the business opportunities. Then, a diagnostic of the study area, sector or organization through the dynamic diagnostic methods is performed. Once the opportunities have been identified, a strategic analysis that allows decision making to prioritize and define the activities or projects that may be achievable in the future is done, and the result of the process is a portfolio of in business opportunities projects fully defined and ready to be planned with a roadmap where the complete path is drawn. The process allows the managers to consistently organize their development processes targeted to real business opportunities. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Business activities; Business opportunities; Common denominators; Development process; Dynamic diagnostics; Roadmap; Strategic analysis; Study areas; Support tool; Industrial management; Managers; Technology",,,,,"Vecchiato, R., Roveda, C., Strategic foresight in corporate organizations: Handling the effect and response uncertainty of technology and social drivers of change (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1527-1539; Jeong, N.-Y., Park, J.-S., Heo, T.-Y., Conceptual designs for trend analysis system: A tool for corporate foresight Proc., Advanced Communication Technology, the 9th International Conference on, pp. 340-344; Pillkahn, U., (2008) Using Trends and Scenarios As Tools for Strategy Development : Shaping the Future of Your Enterprise, , Publicis Corporate Publishing, Berlin; Güemes-Castorena, D., Megatrend methodology to identify development opportunities Proc., PICMET 2009 Proceedings, p. 6; De Miranda Santo, M., Coelho, G.M., Dos Santos, D.M., Filho, L.F., Text mining as a valuable tool in foresight exercises: A study on nanotechnology (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73 (8), pp. 1013-1027. , DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2006.05.020, PII S004016250600117X, Tech Mining: Exploiting Science and Technology Information Resources; Nehme, C.C., Galvao, A., Vaz, A., Coelho, G., Fellows, L., A foresight method for enhancing competitiveness of Brazilian industrial sectors (2009) Innovation and Creativity in A Complex World, pp. 115-131; Malanowski, N., Zweck, A., Bridging the gap between foresight and market research: Integrating methods to assess the economic potential of nanotechnology (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74 (9), pp. 1805-1822. , DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2007.05.010, PII S0040162507001308, Three Special Sections: Assessment of China's and India's Science and Technology Literature Nanotechnology Policy Minding the Gap: Previewing the Potential of Breajthrough Technnologies; Fenwick, D., Daim, T.U., Gerdsri, N., Value Driven Technology Road Mapping (VTRM) process integrating decision making and marketing tools: Case of Internet security technologies (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76 (8), pp. 1055-1077; Rohrbeck, R., Thom, N., Strategic foresight at deutsche telekom AG Proc., Management of Innovation and Technology, 2008.

The so-called improvements planned by liquid-based industrial coatings producers are simply designed to reduce the use of solvents and replace them with water-based materials since this enables them to continue with their traditional methods of manufacture. The simple polymer structure of a UVcurable binder makes it an ideal candidate for introducing new polymer design practices. The constrictions of adhering to heat-curing polymer design will never allow the polymer chemist to put all the essential components into a molecular structure that will ensure uniform and complete cure of the coatings binder.

Our research is based on a multiple-case study of corporate organisations that recently faced major changes in their external environment and increasing turbulence. We expand our understanding of environmental uncertainty by defining the concept of 'boundary uncertainty', which regards the identity of the components of the business (micro) environment. We distinguish between 'continuous' and 'discontinuous' drivers of change and find that they entail different requirements for the design and implementation of strategic foresight actions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","environmental uncertainty; learning; planning; strategic foresight; strategic management","corporate strategy; decision making; learning; management practice",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Critique of Henry Mintzberg's 'The design school': Reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12 (6), pp. 449-461; Becker, P., Corporate foresight in Europe: A first overview (2002) RTD K-2 Scientific and Technological Foresight, , Brussels: European Commission; Bradley, M.R., Costanzo, L.A., Introduction (2009) In Handbook of research on strategic foresight, , ed.

Based on bio-responses of blood shear stress, which was not considered in Chinese medicine, we have initiated the merging of biomechanics with pharmacology and Chinese medicine, establishing the new discipline-biomechanopharmacology. Practice of exercise is a simple and self-regulatory way to promote shear stress in the circulation. Interestingly, acupuncture and massage are also linked with shear stress regulation. These procedures are expected to maintain normal functions of endothelial cells (ECs) by regulating shear stress levels of flowing blood. The statement of ""Diseases are prevented as blood flow is promoted"" by the renowned ancient physician Huatuo, who presented the wise foresight of the efficacy of shear stress, would likely begin a new chapter in preventive pharmacology and medicine in the years to come. © 2012 The Author(s).","Activating Blood Circulation to Remove Blood Stasis; biomechanopharmacology; Chinese medicine; flowing blood; preventive medicine","Diploprion bifasciatum",,,,,"Pennisi, E., How did cooperative behavior evolve (2005) Science, 309, p. 93; Copley, A.L., The history of clinical hemorheology (1985) Clin Hemorheol, 5, pp. 765-811; Muller, S., Labrador, V., Da Isla, N., From hemorheology to vascular mechanobiology: An overview (2004) Clin Hemorheol Microcirc, 30, pp. 185-200; Chiu, J.-J., Chien, S., Effects of disturbed flow on vascular endothelium: Pathophysiological basis and clinical perspectives (2011) Physiol Rev, 91, pp. 327-387; Krizanac-Bengez, L., Mayberg, M.R., Janigro, D., The cerebral vasculature as a therapeutic target for neurological disorders and the role of shear stress in vascular homeostatis and pathophysiology (2004) Neurol Res, 26, pp. 846-853; Wang, Y.X., Miao, H., Li, S., Interplay between integrins and FLK-1 in shear stress-induced signaling (2002) Am J Physiol Cell Physiol, 283, pp. C1540-C1547; Wang, Y.X., Chang, J., Li, Y.C., Shear stress and VEGF activate IKK via the Flk-1/Cbl/Akt signaling pathway (2004) Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol, 286, pp. H685-H692; Wang, Y., Chang, J., Chen, K.D., Selective adapter recruitment and differential signaling networks by VEGF vs. shear stress (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 8875-8879; Wang, J., Chen, K.J., Weng, W.L., Research on diagnostic criteria of blood-stasis symptom-complex (in Chinese) (1988) J Integrated Trad Chin West Med, 8, pp. 585-589; Liao, F.L., Han, D., Ouyang, Z.G., The influences of Ligustrazine and shear stress on PS transformation of endothelial cell membrane investigated by evanescent wave exciting (in Chinese) (2003) Acta Biophys Sin, 19, pp. 92-96; Xie, L.X., Durairajan, S.S.K., Lu, J.H., The effect of salvianolic acid B combined with laminar shear stress on TNF-alpha-stimulated adhesion molecule expression in human aortic endothelial cells (2010) Clin Hemorheol Microcirc, 44, pp. 245-258; O'Brien, J.R., Shear-induced platelet aggregation (1990) Lancet, 335, pp. 711-713; Liao, F.L., Li, B., Inhibition of shear-induced platelet aggregation by Chinese herbal medicines (1997) Clin Hemorheol Microcirc, 17, pp. 315-318; Liao, F.L., Jiao, L.G., Ligustrazini, allicin and shear-induced platelet aggregation (2000) Clin Hemorheol Microcirc, 22, pp. 167-168; Li, M., Handa, S., Ikeda, Y., Specific inhibiting characteristics of tetramethylpyrazine, one of the active ingredients of the Chinese herbal medicine 'chuanxiong', on platelet thrombus formation under high shear rates (2001) Thromb Res, 104, pp. 15-28; Li, M., Zhao, C., Wong, R.N.S., Inhibition of shear-induced platelet aggregation in rat by tetramethylpyrazine and salvianolic acid B (2004) Clin Hemorheol Microcirc, 31, pp. 97-103; Ma, W., Sun, Y., Han, D., Cytoskeletal response of microvessel endothelial cells to an applied stress force at the submicrometer scale studied by atomic force microscopy (2006) Micros Res Tech, 69, pp. 784-793; Han, J.Y., Fan, J.Y., Horie, Y., Ameliorating effects of compounds derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza root extract on microcirculatory disturbance and target organ injury by ischemia and reperfusion (2008) Pharmacol Ther, 117, pp. 280-295; Liao, F.L., Peng, J., Li, W., Microthrombogenesis induced by rose Bengal under ordinary microscopic illumination (1996) Sixth World Congress for Microcirculation, pp. 479-482. , In: Messmer K, Kuble W M, eds, 1996 Aug 25-30, Munich.

Hypoglycemia can be induced by several causes, including an aberrant increase of hypoglycemic agents and adrenal insufficiency. Sorafenib is the first agent to demonstrate a survival benefit in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This small molecule inhibits serine/threonine kinase RAF in tumor cells and tyrosine kinases VEGFR/PDGFR in tumor vasculature and decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis. In this paper, we report a case of HCC who was treated with sorafenib and showed severe hypoglycemia. This hypoglycemia might be induced by two causes, both adrenal insufficiency as an adverse effect of sorafenib and activation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signal by excessive secretion of incompletely processed precursors of IGF-II. Although the IGF signal is suggested to be involved in aberrant growth of HCC in some cases, there is no other report showing the influence of sorafenib on HCC with active IGF signal. Unfortunately, the effect of sorafenib was limited in the present case. However, emerging drugs that directly inhibit the IGF signal can be expected to be highly effective in the treatment of HCC with hypoglycemia. © 2012 S.

It carefully aims to re-examine the notion of environmental uncertainty, the main theoretical approaches advanced by literature on strategy to cope with uncertainty, and foresight activities in corporate organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This article is theoretical in nature. However, its insights are significantly based on empirical analysis: the author has been involved in the past ten years in in-depth investigation of foresight practices in several international firms of different industries. Findings: Several important issues and research questions on strategic foresight have remained largely unresolved from both an academic and managerial perspective. This paper outlines such questions. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it links the work on strategic foresight to a wide range of related literature streams, thus revealing new connections and issues to be explored. Second, it develops a research agenda that may inspire further theoretical and empirical work on the nature and effects of strategic foresight efforts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental uncertainty; Forward planning; Learning; Planning; Strategic foresight; Strategic management; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Alsan, A., Oner, M.A., An integrated view of foresight: Integrated foresight management model (2003) Foresight, 5 (2), pp. 33-45; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Ansoff, H.I., Critique of Henry Mintzberg's 'The design school': Reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12 (6), pp. 449-461; Becker, P., (2002) Corporate Foresight in Europe: A First Overview, RTK2 Scientific and Technological Foresight, , European Commission, Brussels; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., van der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Bradley MacKay, R., Costanzo, L.A., Introduction (2009) Handbook of Research on Strategic Foresight, pp. 1-12. , Bradley MacKay, R., Costanzo, L.A.

After summarising their main points it seeks to consider different approaches to ""sense making"" in the work of future-relevant theorists and practitioners; then to consider the case of sense making through integral approaches and then to explore implications through several themes. These include: a view of changes in the global system, generic responses to the global emergency, the critique of regressive modernity and how responses to ""Cassandra's dilemma"" (to know the future but not be believed) might stand in relation to the views of both authors. The paper aims to conclude with a view of the benefits to be obtained from the use of a four-quadrant approach to understanding and responding to the human predicament. Design/methodology/approach: This is a discussion paper that questions some of the views and assumptions of the earlier papers and explores some implications of an alternative view. Findings: While supporting the drive to improve upon the theoretical foundations of futures studies and foresight, the paper questions whether such developments are as central, or will be as influential, as the authors suggest. A different view of ""how to approach the future"" is recommended, in part through four ""domains of generic responses"" to the global predicament. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents an argument supported by evidence. Both should be reviewed by others in pursuit of extending the conversation beyond philosophical questions to implications in practice. Practical implications: The essence of a methodology to understand, approach and even to resolve many aspects of the global emergency is outlined here. As such the paper has many practical implications for the way that futures and foresight professionals operate and towards what ends. Social implications: The paper provides a substantive basis for qualified hope and engagement with a range of future-shaping tasks. Specifically, these relate to the necessary shifts from ""overshoot and collapse"" trajectories to options for ""moderated descent"". Originality/value: Much of the work carried out on the perspective and issues discussed here has been carried out by those working outside of the futures/foresight domain. The value is both in affirming positive ways forward and extending the professional reach of futures/foresight workers to embrace new ideas and methods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Critique; Forecasting; Forward planning; Generic responses; Global emergency; Global system; Human development; Regressive modernity; Sense making",,,,,,"Adam, B., Cultural future matters: An exploration in the spirit of Max Weber's methodological writings (2009) Time and Society, 18 (7), pp. 7-25; AtKisson, A., (1999) Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at Today's World, , Scribe, Melbourne; Bell, W., (1997) The Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, Knowledge, 1. , Transaction Publishers, Piscataway, NY, 3rd ed; Bergson, H., (1946) The Creative Mind, , The Greenwood Press, New York, NY; de Jouvenel, B., (1967) The Art of Conjecture, , Weidenfeld & Nicholson, London; Hamilton, C., (2010) Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth About Climate Change, , Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest; Hanson, J., (2009) Storms of My Grandchildren, , Bloomsbury, New York, NY; Hulme, M., (2009) Why We Disagree about Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press; Kemph, H., (2008) How the Rich Are Destroying the Earth, , Finch Publishing, Sydney; Klare, M., (2012) The Race for What's Left: The Global Scramble for the World's Last Resources, , Metropolitan Books, New York, NY; Manne, R., What is Rudd's agenda?

Real indeterminacy arises in this setting in the form of continuum of equilibria corresponding to different commodity allocations. The cause of real indeterminacy is arbitrariness of prices at the final date. If some arbitrary price tends to infinity then the equilibrium in the limit has an intuitive economic interpretation. The limiting equilibrium with formally infinite prices we interpret as an equilibrium with default: if a special state of the environment occurs, consumers may forget about their debts and savings and start new life from scratch. Existence of equilibria with defaults is proven. A numerical experiment shows that in some cases equilibria with finite prices are Pareto dominated by equilibria with defaults. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, the need of techniques to control or reduce the amount of changes during software development projects. The authors advocate the use of foresight methods as a valuable input to requirements elicitation, with the potential to decrease the number of changes that would be required after deployment, by anticipating them. In this paper, the authors define a process for using a foresight method, namely Futures Wheel, for requirements elicitation. To illustrate the use of this approach, the authors perform a case study using a route planning system.

The original main objectives, funding of road maintenance and -expansion and the financing of public budgets, are more and more pushed into the background through steering-policy objectives (demandside management, environmental protection, internalisation of external costs). Beginning with toll stations withmanual payment to satellite-based toll systems, there are various technologies, to be selected by various relevant criteria. The toll amount varies depending on different vehicle criteria (usually length, height and number of axles). In recent years, the vehicle weight and emission criteria have also become an issue. This requires more complex classification and enforcement technologies. A major challenge is that many toll systems, unfortunately, despite all efforts, are still not interoperable. It has also been contemplates that the tolling technology could also be used for other ITS applications (e. g. e-Call, various information services). Furthermore, it is the political objective (at least that of the EU) that in future not only heavy goods vehicles but all vehicles must pay a mileage-based fee. And on each and every road, not just on the primary road network. This would represent a significant step towards the true cost of transport. © Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag.","CALM standard; DSRC; Free flow; Future ITS applications; Interoperability; Satellite tolling; Tolling principles and objectives; True cost of transport; Vehicle classification",,,,,,"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maut, 27.05.2011; http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maut, 27.05.2011; http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maut, 27.05.2011; http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maut, 27.05.2011; http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maut, 27.05.2011; IS21214 ""Communications Access Land Mobiles - Infrared"" published by ISO; http://www.isotc204wg16.org/pubdocs/The%20CALM%20Handbookv6-070301.pdf, The CALM Handbook; http://www.comesafety.org/uploads/media/COMeSafety_Project_Presentation_01.pdf, COMeSafety - A EU Specific Support Activity","Jäkel, E.; Inex/Zamir, Moserwaldweg 13, 8042 Graz, Austria; email: erichj@inexzamir.com",,,,,,,,01782312,,,,"German","At-Automatisierungstechnik",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861783079

Even before completing the consolidation of their power on a local level, some members of the family - first Placido senior and then the son Francesco junior (1686-1759) - move to the capital, while the rest of the family continues to reside on the site of their recent affirmation, cooperating in the management of the estate.

In the mid-1700s, after a process of power construction that lasted four generations - and with the integral involvement and ""teamwork"" of all members of the family - the Notarbartolo Dukes di Villarosa reach the acme of their fortune, entering the ranks of the great Sicilian aristocracy.","Dukes of Villarosa; Feudal lords; Inheritance strategies; Matrimonial policy; Modern age; Notarbartolo; Public offices; Sicily",,,,,,"Ligresti, D., Calabrese, M.C., (2002) I Paternò di Raddusa.

Il possesso di un feudo popolato, inoltre, conferiva il diritto ereditario a sedere in Parlamento nel braccio baronale, detenendo un numero di seggi pari al numero dei feudi popolati sotto il proprio dominio, con l'evidente conseguenza che il grosso del potere all'interno del Parlamento stesso si concentrava nelle mani di pochi feudatari; Raggioni del Sig.

The aim of this study is that the basic process provides foresights into EOT and leakage-current density requirements. We chose rutile-TiO 2 for the insulators to meet the requirement of relative permittivity and Ru to suppress leakage-current density. We found the as-deposited lower electrode of Ru crystallized into the rutile phase of TiO 2 with a relative permittivity of 109 due to the similarity of crystal structures and lattice constants between rutile-TiO 2 and rutile-RuO 2 , which was generated by oxidizing Ru with ambient oxygen. Furthermore, we confirmed that doping elements that had a small-ionic radius, such as Co, decreased leakage-current density. The dependence of the leakage current of Ru/Co-doped-TiO 2 /Ru capacitors on temperature and analysis of the band structure with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that leakage-current density is determined by a balance between thermionic current and tunneling current through the Schottky barrier. Through calculations using a theoretical equation for these currents, the optimum percentage of Co was estimated to range from 0.3-0.6 % to meet requirement of leakage current for 20 nm- DRAMs. © 2011 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Ambient oxygen; Band engineering; Doping elements; Leakage current densitys; Relative permittivity; Rutile phase; Schottky barriers; Theoretical equation; Thermionic currents; TiO; Tunneling current; Capacitors; Cobalt; Current density; Leakage currents; Oxide minerals; Permittivity; Ruthenium compounds; Schottky barrier diodes; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoelectrons; Titanium dioxide",,,,,"(2010), International Technology Roadmafor Semiconductor 2010 update, front end process, DRAM Stacked Capacitor Technology Requirements; Kwon, O.S., Kim, S.K., Cho, M., Hwang, C.S., Jeong, J., Chemically conformal ALD of SrTiO 3 thin films using conventional metallorganic precursors (2005) Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 152 (4), pp. C229-C236. , DOI 10.1149/1.1869292; Robertson, J., (2000) J.

The designer must anticipate not only the behavior of individual actors, but also how that behavior will aggregate. Rising complexity brought about by increases in speeds of adaptation, diversity, connectedness, and interdependence make institutional design all the more challenging. Given the focus on equilibria, the extant literature on mechanism design might appear incapable of coping with this complexity. Yet, I suggest that a deeper engagement with the origins of the mechanism-design framework reveals insights that may help us design robust, adaptive institutions that can harness complexity. © SAGE Publications 2012.","complexity; learning; mechanism design; robustness",,,,,,"Andreoni, J., Miller, J., Auctions with artificial adaptive agents (1995) Games and Economic Behavior, 10 (1), pp. 39-64; Axelrod, R., Cohen, M.D., (2000) Harnessing Complexity: Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier, , New York: Free Press; Bak, P., (1996) How Nature Works: The Science of Self-Organized Criticality, , New York: Copernicus; Barabási, A.L., (2002) Linked: The New Science of Networks, , New York: Basic Books; Bednar, J., (2009) The Robust Federation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bednar, J., Page, S.E., Can game(s) theory explain culture?

Genomic selection (GS) is a statistical approach that utilizes all available genome-wide markers simultaneously to estimate breeding values or total genetic values. For breeding programmes, GS is a promising alternative to the traditional marker-assisted selection for manipulating complex polygenic traits often controlled by many small-effect genes. Various factors, such as genetic architecture of selection traits, population size and structure, genetic evaluation systems, density of SNP markers and extent of linkage disequilibrium, have been shown to be the key drivers of the accuracy of GS. In this paper, we provide an overview of the status of these aspects in current apple-breeding programmes. Strategies for GS for fruit quality and disease resistance are discussed, and an update on an empirical genomic selection study in a New Zealand apple-breeding programme is provided, along with a foresight of expected accuracy from such selection. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Apple-breeding programme; DNA sequence; Genomic selection; Malus × domestica Borkh.; Quantitative trait loci","Malus; Malus x domestica",,,,,"Andersson, L., Genetic dissection of phenotypic diversity in farm animals (2001) Nat Rev Genet, 2, pp. 130-138; Beavis, W.D., The power and deceit of QTL experiments: Lessons from comparative QTL studies.

Secondly, the move to transcend disciplinary specialisation, via inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary approaches is strengthening. Thirdly, at a higher order theoretical level, these developments are explicitly theorized in the discourses associated with postformal reasoning, integral theory and planetary consciousness. In spite of all these developments in other disciplines and knowledge fields, the institution of mass public education, with its underpinning industrial worldview, has been pretty static since its inception two hundred years ago. Finally, the paper identifies three minor, but significant, waves of evolutionary emergence in education over the last hundred years that if articulated and nurtured could strengthen the development of evolutionary pedagogies for the 21st century. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolution of consciousness; Evolutionary pedagogies; Foresight; Futures studies; Integral; Planetary; Postformal; Postformal pedagogies","education; theoretical study",,,,,"Gidley, J., Inayatullah, S., (2002) Youth Futures: Comparative Research and Transformative Visions, , Praeger, Westport, CT; Gidley, J., Bateman, D., Smith, C., (2004) Futures in Education: Principles, Practice and Potential, , Australian Foresight Institute, Melbourne; Freire, P., (1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, , Herder and Herder, New York; Illich, I., (1975) Deschooling Society, , Calder and Boyers, London; Gidley, J., Beyond homogenisation of global education: do alternative pedagogies such as Steiner education have anything to offer an emergent globalis/ing world?

This assumption is based on the similarities of the ape-like brain size and post-cranial characteristics of the earliest hominid species to chimpanzees. Whilst it is unclear whether chimpanzees share the same foresight and contemplation of alternatives as with humans, it is nevertheless clear that chimpanzees lack creative imagination - an aspect of modern human imagination that sets humanity apart from its hominid ancestors. Creative imagination pertains to the ability to combine different forms of knowledge and ways of thinking to form creative and novel ideas. This chapter discusses seven critical steps in the evolution of the human imagination. These steps provide a clear picture of the gradual emergence of creative imagination in humans from their primitive origins as Homo sapiens some 200,000 years ago. This chronological evolution of the imaginative mind of humans involves both biological and cultural change that began soon after the divergence of the two lineages that led to modern humans and African apes. © The British Academy 2007.

In addition, the aim is to construct information pathways for the foresight mechanism, for the use of practitioners, to enable them to manage talent and competences with an anticipatory perspective. The research strategy is theoretical research with interpretive concept analysis approach. The research compares, compiles and combines theories and perspectives of strategic human resource management and development, talent management, competence management and foresight. The results combine the information pathways and elements of the pathways for the competence foresight mechanism. The main three pathways in the mechanism are the pathways for detecting the needed competences for strategy implementation, the pathways for detecting rapid changes and the loss of competences. As talent management frameworks are organization specific, so are the mechanisms and information pathways for competence foresight. The results can be adjusted and developed to fit into other organizations. The analysis and results provide the practitioners in human resources with new perspectives to use systematic foresight processes in talent management and development. The results can also be used for modelling the information pathways for the competence foresight mechanism in talent management software. The research on human resources development and talent management does not deal with competence foresight. This paper addresses this deficiency and brings new, valuable perspectives of foresight and future studies for researchers and practitioners. This paper challenges further research on various aspects of competence foresight. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Competence foresight; Competences; Human resource management; Information pathways in foresight mechanism; Strategic human resource management; Talent management and development",,,,,,"Aalto, H.-K., (2007) Ennakoinnista eväitä koulutussuunnitteluun ja työelämäyhteistyöhön, , Tulevaisuuden tutkimuskeskus, Turku; Baldwin, R., (2006) Globalisation: The Great Unbundling(s), , Prime Minister's Office in Finland, Helsinki; Boam, R., Sparrow, P.R., The rise and rationale of competency-based approaches (1992) Designing and Achieving Competency: A Competency-based Approach to Developing People and Organisations, pp. 3-15. , in Boam, R. and Sparrow, P.R.

Unfortunately, Parkinson did not have the foresight to wish that “the relief of this distressing malady” should last indefinitely. Soon after the introduction of levodopa, it became clear that its chronic use is associated with motor Ÿuctuations and dyskinesia that eventually occur in the majority of patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) and can be major causes of disability in their own right.2,3 Thus, paraphrasing Parkinson’s words, we are now confronted with the remaining challenge “to point out appropriate means to prevent or relieve the long-term complications of levodopa treatment.”. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Parkinson, J., (1817) An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, , Sherwood, Neely and Jones, London, U.K; Cotzias, G.C., Van, W.M., Schiffer, L.M., Aromatic amino acids and modification of parkinsonism (1967) N.

The theory connects the area of accounting regulations and the place where the result of their application is put into use, namely the capital market. Quantifying this connection is done indirectly, by using two direct connections. First we quantify the similitude degree of the considered accounting regulations based on a detailed content analysis. Secondly we quantify to what extent the foresights of the considered accounting regulations are actually used in practice by companies being listed on the capital market. Once determined the two correlations we derive the link between a certain capital market and a set of accounting regulations that is different from the one officially being applied by companies listed in the considered market. The proposed theory is tested by considering accounting regulations issued by the IASB and the FASB and companies being listed on the LSE and the NYSE, focusing on financial assets' measurement. We conclude by validating the proposed theory based on the fact that we have dimensioned a conceptual and methodological algorithm that was applied and generated results allowing the interpretation of the feasibility of a global capital market between financial reporting theory and practice.","Accounting practices; Accounting regulations; Capital market; Feasibility; Theory","Accounting practices; Capital markets; Content analysis; Feasibility; Financial assets; Financial reporting; Global capitals; Similitude degree; Theory; Theory and practice; Industry; Commerce",,,,,"Ball, R., Kothari, S.P., Robin, A., The effect of international institutional factors on properties of accounting earnings (2000) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 29, pp. 1-52; Bonaci, C.G., Matis, D., Mustata, R.V., Framework for documenting national accounting practices' orientation towards IAS/IFRS (2010) Journal of International Management Studies, 10 (3), pp. 125-132; Dargenidou, C., McLeay, S., Raonic, I., Expected earnings growth and the cost of capital: An analysis of accounting regime change in the European financial market (2006) Abacus, 42 (3-4), pp. 388-414. , DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6281.2006.00207.x; Fontes, A., Rodrigues, L., Craig, R., Measuring convergence of national accounting standards with international financial reporting standards (2005) Accounting Forum, 29, pp. 415-236; Frost, C.A., Gordon, E.A., Hayes, A.F., Stock exchange disclosure and market development: An analysis of 50 international exchanges (2006) Journal of Accounting Research, 44 (3), pp. 437-483. , DOI 10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00208.x; Garrido, P., Leon, A., Zorio, A., Measurement of formal harmonization progress: The IASC experience (2002) The International Journal of Accounting, 37, pp. 1-26; Kang, T., Global market segmentation and patterns in stock market reaction to US earnings announcements: Further evidence (2005) Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting, 16 (2), pp. 123-141; Morais, A., Fialho, A., Do harmonized accounting standards lead to harmonized accounting practices?

One widely spread methodology in technology foresight is Godet's Scenario Method, which includes a module (MICMAC) performing the so-called structural analysis. The goal of the structural analysis is to identify the most important variables in a system. To this end, it makes use of an influence matrix that describes the relations between the variables. This information is usually given by experts based on their own knowledge and experience. However, some of the information of the influence matrix may contain errors due to the subjective nature of the criteria and opinions of the experts. Here we propose a new analysis that follows a multi-objective approach and allows to measure the sensibility of the model versus possible errors at the input. The well-known NSGA-II algorithm has been used as a solver. The results are encouraging and deserve further investigation. © 2011 IEEE.","Godet's method; multiobjective optimization; scenario method; technology foresight","Godet's method; Influence matrix; Knowledge and experience; Multi objective; NSGA-II algorithm; scenario method; technology foresight; Errors; Intelligent systems; Multiobjective optimization; Structural analysis; Systems analysis; Innovation",,,,,"Godet, M., How to be rigorous with scenario planning (2000) Prospective, 2 (1), pp. 5-9; Durance, P., Godet, M., Scenario building: Uses and abuses (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Science, 77 (9), pp. 1488-1492; Godet, M., (1987) Scenarios and Strategic Management, , Butterworth-Heinemann; Godet, M., Creating Futures: Scenario Planning as Strategic Management Tool (2006) Economica; Bettencourt, R., Strategic prospective for the implementation of employment policies in the Azores (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1566-1574; Lee, Y.-C., Chao, Y.H., Lin, S.-B., Structural approach to design user interface (2010) Computers in Industry, 61 (7), pp. 613-623; Deb, K., (2001) Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, , John Wiley and Sons; Levenshtein, V., Binary codes capable of correcting deletions, insertions, and reversals (1966) Soviet Physics, Doklady, 10 (8), pp. 707-710; Wagner, R.A., Fischer, M.J., The string-to-string correction problem (1974) Journal of the ACM, 21 (1), pp. 168-173; Deb, K., Agrawal, S., Pratap, A., Meyarivan, T., A Fast Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization: NSGA-II (2000) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1917. , ser.

The study argues that playwrights were writing with foresight, inscribing the constraints and resources of the stages into their texts. It goes further, to posit that Shakespeare and his playwright-contemporaries adhered to a set of generic conventions, rather than specific local company practices, about how space and place were to be related in performance: the playwrights constituted thus an overarching virtual 'company' producing playtexts that shared features across the acting companies and playhouses. By clarifying a sixteenth- to seventeenth-century conception of theatrical place, Tim Fitzpatrick adds a new layer of meaning to our understanding of the plays. His approach adds a new dimension to these particular documents whichthough many of them are considered of great literary worthwere not originally generated for any other reason than to be performed within a specific performance context. The fact that the playwrights were aware of the features of this performance tradition makes their texts a potential mine of performance information, and casts light back on the texts themselves: if some of their meanings are 'spatial', these will have been missed by purely literary tools of analysis. © Tim Fitzpatrick 2011.

Through the scientific conceiving we proposed a system of methodological operations (recommendations, prescriptions, guiding), which will ensure the quality and efficiency of the undertaken training process. Purpose of Study: This research was undertaken as a necessity of renewal within the field, with the purpose of showing that in the Physical Education activity only the motric objectives are taken into consideration, while the cognitive and affective ones, although known, are not introduced in the didactic conception or in students' training. Research Methods: Bibliographic study method; Observation method; Enquiry method (conversation, questionnaire, etc.); Pedagogical experiment method; Statistical-Mathematical method; Graphical method. Findings: I have realized a study on a number of 20 professors with the purpose of verifying the statement that during didactic conception, they use only motric objectives, disregarding the cognitive and affective ones. Conclusions: Through scientific conception thought on the basis of cognitive and affective objectives along with the motric ones, we propose a new thinking concept and a new didactic action, which will state explicitly and organized, a system of methodological operations (recommendations, prescriptions, guiding), which will ensure the quality and efficiency of the training process undertaken. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive and affective; Didactic conception; Objectives; Physical education; Professors; Programs; Students",,,,,,"Dragnea, A., (1984) Measuring and Evaluating in Physical Education and Sports, pp. 37-45. , Sport-Tourism Publishing House, Bucharest; Dragnea, A., Bota, A., (1999) Theory of Motric Activities, , Didactic and Pedagogical Publishing House R.A., Bucharest, 163,164,165,166; De Landsheere, V., De Landsheere, G., (1979) Defining Educational Objectives, pp. 37-40. , Editura Didactic and Pedagogical Publishing House, Bucharest 110-120; Epuran, M., Two questions for the authors of the evaluation system of pupils in physical education and sport (2001) Sport Science, 26 (7), pp. 23-29; Epuran, M., (2005) The Methodology of Research for Body Activities.

Therefore the writer holds that a publishing house should sort out the essence of excellent books, walk out of the mistaken idea about the publishing of excellent books, figure out a developing strategy of their own, create excellent books with a foreseeing insight into a potential market, establish independent intellectual property and nuclear competitiveness based on the publishing of excellent books. On the other hand, the publishing of excellent books is not merely the business of publishing industry, it calls for the joint efforts of the authors, readers, administration and publishers; it's necessary to draw the attention of the whole society and create an atmosphere thirsty for the publishing of excellent books. What's more, we need to curtail expenditure in publishing industry, remove the weeds from publishing industry and provide fertile soil for the publishing of excellent books. In a broader sense, to hammer-harden excellent works and create works handed down from generation to generation, a benign ecology and fertile soil for the publishing of excellent books must be provided. © 2011 IEEE.","connotation; excellent books; fickleness; insight into a big market; mistaken idea; system and mechanism","connotation; excellent books; fickleness; insight into a big market; mistaken idea; system and mechanism; Commerce; Competition; Innovation; Industry",,,,,"Li, Y., Developing the Publishing Market and Excellent Books (1998) Journal of Nanjing Normal University, (3). , J; Yuan, A., Li, C., On Four Misunderstandings in Excellent Books Publishing Practice (2006) Publishing Research, (1). , J; Lan, Y., Reflections on Publishing Awareness in market-oriented economy (2007) China Market, (31). , J; Ma, P., Competitive Products: Tidemark of Editing Ethic (1999) China Publishing Journal, (8). , J; Li, J., Effective Mechanism (2005) China Publishing Journal, (7). , J","Liping, L.; Publishing House, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; email: haoyukai@163.com",,"Chin.

Rather than the contrast between imaging, i. e. creating images that are understood as offering a view on what is out there, and imagining, i. e. creating images offering impressions of how the nanoscale could look like and images presenting visions of worlds that might be realized, it is the entanglement between imaging and imagining which is the key to understanding what images do. Three main arenas of entanglement of imag(in)ing and the tensions involved are discussed: production practices and use of visualizations of the nanoscale; imag(in)ing the future and the present; and entanglements of nanoscience and art. In these three arenas one sees struggles about which images might stand for nanotechnology, but also some stabilization of the entanglement of imag(in)ing, for example in established rules in the practices of visualizing the nanoscale. Three images have become iconic, through the combination of their wide reception and further circulation. All three, the IBM logo, the Foresight Institute's Nanogear image, and the so-called Nanolouse, depict actual or imagined technoscientific objects and are thus seen as representing technoscientific achievements - while marking out territory. © 2011 The Author(s).","Artist's impressions; Images; Imagining; Representation of nanotechnology; Visualization of the nanoscale",,,,,,"Andre, G., Kulakauskas, S., Chapot-Chartier, M.-P., Navet, B., Deghorain, M., Bernard, E., Hols, P., Dufrêne, Y.F., Imaging the nanoscale organization of peptidoglycan in living Lactococcus lactis cells (2010) Nat Commun, 1, p. 27. , doi:10.1038/ncomms1027; Bachtold, A., Hadley, P., Nakanishi, T., Dekker, C., Logic circuits with carbon nanotube transistors (2001) Science, 294, pp. 1317-1320; Brown, M.B., (2009) Science in Democracy.

The theory connects the area of accounting regulations and the place where the result of their application is put into use, namely the capital market. Quantifying this connection is done indirectly, by using two direct connections. Firstly there is quantified the similitude degree of the considered accounting regulations based on a detailed content analysis. Secondly there is quantified to what extent the foresights of the considered accounting regulations are actually used in practice by companies being listed on the capital market. Once determined the two correlations there is derived the link between a certain capital market and a set of accounting regulations that is different from the one officially being applied by companies listed in the considered market. The proposed theory is tested by considering accounting regulations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and companies being listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), focusing on financial assets' measurement. Paper concludes by validating the proposed theory based on the fact that we have dimensioned a conceptual and methodological algorithm that was applied and generated results allowing the interpretation of the feasibility of a global capital market between financial reporting theory and practice.","Accounting practices; Accounting regulations; Capital market; Feasibility; Theory",,,,,,"Andreu, J., Torra, S., Market Index Biases and Minimum Risk Indices (2010) WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics, 7 (1), pp. 33-58; Ball, R., Kothari, S.P., Robin, A., The Effect of International Institutional Factors on Properties of Accounting Earnings (2000) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 29, pp. 1-52; Bonaci, C.G., Matis, D., Mustata, R.V., Framework for Documenting National Accounting Practices' Orientation Towards IAS/IFRS (2010) Journal of International Management Studies, 10 (3), pp. 125-132; Bonaci, C.G., Matis, D., Strouhal, J., Crisis of Fair Value Measurement?

The growth of Foresight and Futures Studies as a discipline has been less robust than the internal logic of the field would predict, potentially indicating an opportunity for theoretical renewal. Foresight is often justified on managerial grounds, with the argument that a discipline is needed to guide decision-making in a technologically aggressive, post-industrial society. Some within Foresight and Futures Studies have argued for the active development of alternatives to these managerial justifications. However, the links between Strategic Management and Futures Studies are robust and the embrace of cross-disciplinary dialogue has proven invigorating in some other disciplines. An evaluation of the goals and logic of Foresight from the standpoint of mainstream Strategic Management gives a novel perspective on the field, highlighting its importance to information processing. Finally, Foresight speaks to well-established normative problems with short-term biases in managerial contexts. For the purposes of this article, the terms ""Foresight"" and ""Futures Studies"" are used interchangeably to refer to the general study of futures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"decision making; future prospect; information processing; management; strategic approach; theoretical study",,,,,"Coyle, G., The nature and value of futures studies or do futures have a future?

Here - on the basis of futures studies - path dependency and path creation can be linked and appear as two sides of the same coin.

But few people carefully consider this issue, especially, while the 3C firms would expand their business field in developing the electrical/electronic (E/E) technology based vehicle products, which are against more rigorous specifications to the automotive industry. Hence, from the quality aspect, this paper proposes an analytical mechanism (i.e., stage-gate analyzer) to help the formulation process of strategy-making. We illustrate the strategic quality aspect across several management levels. We also apply an example in Telematics to demonstarte how to ensure process reengineering's consistency on the ongoing NPD process with APQP requested. Despite a lot of large 3C enterprises in Taiwan are running the requested now, both strategy and execution need company-wide common recognition and efforts. We find that a strong linkage between strategy-makers and executors would significantly reduce the deviation in identifying business vision and operational process, and then assist to improve their great foresight with consistent actions toward a business goal.","Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP); Emergent strategy making; Stage-gate analyzer; Telematics","Advanced product quality planning; Business goals; Business vision; Common recognition; Emergent strategy making; Formulation process; Management level; Operational process; Process reengineering; Quality aspects; Technology-based; Telematics; Product development; Quality control; Reengineering; Automotive industry",,,,,"Bobrek, M., Sokovic, M., Implementation of APQP-concept in design of QMS (2005) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 162-163, pp. 718-724; Carmeli, A., Schaubroeck, J., Top management team behavioral integration, decision quality, and organizational decline (2006) The Leadership Quarterly, 17 (5), pp. 441-453; Chen, C.P., Chien, C.F., What constitutes 'a quality decision'?

The analysis takes into account significant changes in the conceptualization of virtual worlds that have led to overcome their status as distinct social technological environments, where practices take place isolated from the physical setting. The increased transparency of mediations, which traditionally have placed limits on the immersion and interaction between people and virtual objects, implies that they occupy a secondary place as a key element in the definitions of virtual worlds. Based on this consideration, the article analyzed the other components that support the social layer of virtual worlds and provides them with a high educational potential. Among other aspects of formation, the article explores the ability of technological mediation, immersion and social presence, non-physical materiality or practice that is itself part of a virtual world so defined. Finally, the need to design appropriate educational theories and hybrid scenarios that result from the interactions in-out of physical reality is discussed.","3D learning scenarios; Cyberspace; Educational theory; Expanded learning; Virtual identity; Virtual worlds",,,,,,"Biocca, F., The cyborg's dilemma: Progressive embodiment in virtual environments (1997) Journal of ComputerMediated Communication, 3, p. 2. , http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/120837728/main.html, ftx_abs?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0, Consultado el 18.V. 2010; Blythe, M., Pastiche scenarios (2004) Interactions, 11 (5), pp. 51-53; Bowman, D.A., Mcmahan, R.P., Virtual reality: How much immersion is enough?

Design/methodology/approach – Counterfactual analysis, scenario analysis and peripheral vision are presented as the constituting methodological triad through which scenario thinking comes into representation. Findings – Scenario thinking is a temporally emerging everyday organizational practice. By placing emphasis on the mundane and taken for granted activities that come together to form the nexus of the practice, often deep underlying structures of organizational behaviour contributing to scenario thinking can be theorised. Research limitations/implications – The practice conceptualisation of scenario thinking inverts and challenges existing management and practitioners' conventional understanding of the practice as an episodic phenomenon in waiting to be facilitated by an expert with specific end points and conformity. Practical implications – Foresight practitioners and researchers can use this as an analytical starting point for the study and theorising of scenario thinking in self organized groups. Originality/value – The paper provides a new angle of vision to extend understanding of the development and theorising of scenario thinking in autonomous working groups. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Innovation; Product innovation; Strategic management; Working practices",,,,,,"Ashton, W., Johnson, A., Stacey, G., Monitoring science and technology for competitive advantage (1994) Competitive Intelligence Review, 5 (1), pp. 5-16; Barber, M., Analyst, S., Vic, B., Wildcards – signals from a future near you (2006) Journal of Future Studies, 11 (1), pp. 75-94; Barnes, B., Practice as collective action (2002) The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory, pp. 17-28. , in Schatzki, T., Knorr Cetina, K. and Von Savigny, E.

Design/methodology/approach: An evolutionary perspective is deployed to specify the presumed relationship between managerial foresight and firm performance measures. A positive relationship between managerial foresight and firm performance is proposed. The hypothesis is tested through Spearman's rho, on Swedish managers, and firms in the computer programming industry. Managers' foresight as well as performance is assessed as indexes. Findings: The paper finds a moderate and statistically significant positive relationship between managers' foresight and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: There is support for the theoretical relationship between managerial foresight and firm performance. There is a strong rationale for further studies.

A major challenge to the understanding of the origins of this assignment is the archetypal ""key-lock vs. frozen accident"" dilemma. Here we re-examine this dilemma in light of 1) the fundamental veto on ""foresight evolution"", 2) modular structures of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and 3) the updated library of aa-binding sites in RNA aptamers successfully selected in vitro for eight amino acids.Results: The aa-binding sites of arginine, isoleucine and tyrosine contain both their cognate triplets, anticodons and codons. We have noticed that these cases might be associated with palindrome-dinucleotides. For example, one-base shift to the left brings arginine codons CGN, with CG at 1-2 positions, to the respective anticodons NCG, with CG at 2-3 positions. Formally, the concomitant presence of codons and anticodons is also expected in the reverse situation, with codons containing palindrome-dinucleotides at their 2-3 positions, and anticodons exhibiting them at 1-2 positions. A closer analysis reveals that, surprisingly, RNA binding sites for Arg, Ile and Tyr ""prefer"" (exactly as in the actual genetic code) the anticodon(2-3)/codon(1-2) tetramers to their anticodon(1-2)/codon(2-3) counterparts, despite the seemingly perfect symmetry of the latter. However, since in vitro selection of aa-specific RNA aptamers apparently had nothing to do with translation, this striking preference provides a new strong support to the notion of the genetic code emerging before translation, in response to catalytic (and possibly other) needs of ancient RNA life. Consistently with the pre-translation origin of the code, we propose here a new model of tRNA origin by the gradual, Fibonacci process-like, elongation of a tRNA molecule from a primordial coding triplet and 5'DCCA3' quadruplet (D is a base-determinator) to the eventual 76 base-long cloverleaf-shaped molecule.Conclusion: Taken together, our findings necessarily imply that primordial tRNAs, tRNA aminoacylating ribozymes, and (later) the translation machinery in general have been co-evolving to ''fit'' the (likely already defined) genetic code, rather than the opposite way around. Coding triplets in this primal pre-translational code were likely similar to the anticodons, with second and third nucleotides being more important than the less specific first one. Later, when the code was expanding in co-evolution with the translation apparatus, the importance of 2-3 nucleotides of coding triplets ""transferred"" to the 1-2 nucleotides of their complements, thus distinguishing anticodons from codons. This evolutionary primacy of anticodons in genetic coding makes the hypothesis of primal stereo-chemical affinity between amino acids and cognate triplets, the hypothesis of coding coenzyme handles for amino acids, the hypothesis of tRNA-like genomic 3' tags suggesting that tRNAs originated in replication, and the hypothesis of ancient ribozymes-mediated operational code of tRNA aminoacylation not mutually contradicting but rather co-existing in harmony.Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Eugene V.

Yet LUC is not a ""law"" in the sense of appearing in the Criminal Code, nor is it a Law of Nature like gravity. It is actually a manifestation of our inadequate efforts at foresight, and there are things we can do to counteract it. This paper identifies classes of factors which have lead to unintended consequences in the privacy and computer security domains, though the list is by no means exhaustive. It is primarily intended to inspire further thinking and research. We clearly need to make a stronger effort to ""foresee the unforeseeable"" or at least ""expect the unexpected"" to maintain public confidence in technological systems. The disciplines of strategic foresight and automated policy analysis may prove useful in attaining this goal. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","hacking; policy analysis; privacy; security; strategic foresight; technology policy; Unintended consequences","Data privacy; Personal computing; Security systems; Policy analysis; security; Strategic foresight; Technology policy; Unintended consequences; Computer privacy",,,,,"Healy, T., The Unanticipated Consequences of Technology, , http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/submitted/healy/consequences.html, articled posted at website, accessed February 10, 2011; Perrow, C., (1999) Normal Accidents: Living with High Risk Technologies, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Tenner, E., (1996) Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences, , Vintage Books, New York; Taleb, N., The Black Swan (2007) The Impact of the Highly Improbable, , Random House, New York; Dörner, D., (1989) The Logic of Failure: Why Things Go Wrong and What We Can Do to Make Them Right, , Metropolitan Books, New York English Translation; (2009) Retail Council of Canada Submission - On Copyrights, , http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/008.nsf/eng/02560.html, September 11 accessed February 10, 2011; http://eur-lex.europa.eu, accessed February 10, 2011; Flatley, J.L., (2010) Is Canada's IPod Tax Back?, , http://www.engadget.com, posted March 17 accessed February 10, 2011; Antognini, R.L., The law of unintended consequences: HIPAA and liability insurers; at first glance, the Privacy Regulations appear to be adverse to insurers and defense counsel, but McCarran-Ferguson and exceptions may save the day (2002) Defense Counsel Journal, 69 (3), pp. 296-305; Kapushian, M., Hungry, Hungry HIPPA: When Privacy Regulations Go Too Far (2004) Fordham Urban Law Journal, 31 (6), pp. 1483-1506; Vogel, P., US Law Against Online Gambling Makes it the Biggest Loser (2010) E-Commerce Times, , http://www.ecommercetimes.com/rsstory/70775.html?wlc=1287123815, September 9 accessed February 10, 2011; Cameron, K., (2011) More Unintended Consequences of Browser Leakage, , http://www.identityblog.com/?p=1088, accessed February 10; Wondracek, G., Holz, T., A Practical Attack to De-Anonymize Social Network Users, , http://www.iseclab.org/papers/sonda-TR.pdf, Technical Report TR-iSecLab-0110-001, accessed February 11, 2011; http://www.iseclab.org/people/gilbert/experiment, accessed February 10, 2011; Eckersley, P., How Unique Is Your Web Browser?, , https://panopticlick.eff.org/browser-uniqueness.pdf, accessed February 11, 2011; Schumacher, E.F., (1975) Small Is Beautiful - Economics As if People Mattered, , Harper & Row, New York; Gaudin, S., TJ Maxx Breach Costs Hit $17 Million, , http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/showArticle.jhtml?articleID= 199601551, accessed February 10, 2011; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/26/emma-jones-british- teache_n_477337.html, accessed February 10, 2011; http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1294700/Facebooks-Raoul-Moat- tribute-page-breached-termsconditions.html#ixzz0v4NoxM50, accessed February 10, 2010; Levy, S.J., (2010) Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, , 25th Anniversary Edition.

Today, businesses may make use of enterprise asset-management (EAM) solutions for many asset-related processes, ranging from the core asset-management functions to maintenance, inventory, contracts, warranties, procurement, and customer-service management. While EAM solutions have transformed the operational aspects of asset management through data capture and process automation, the decision-making process with respect to assets still heavily relies on institutional knowledge and anecdotal insights. Analytics-driven asset management is an approach that makes use of advanced analytics and optimization technologies to transform the vast amounts of data from asset management, metering, and sensor systems into actionable insight, foresight, and prescriptions that can guide decisions involving strategic and tactical assets, as well as customer and business models. © 2011 by International Business Machines Corporation.",,"Business models; Customer-service; Decision making process; Institutional knowledge; Operational aspects; Optimization technology; Physical assets; Process automation; Sensor systems; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Information management; Sales; Asset management",,,,,"http://www.dcwater.com, District of Columbia, Water and Sewer Authority.

To provide on-demand searches, we tackled two technical issues: (1) organizing efficient event searches and (2) filtering out noises from search results. Our system employed query expansion with typical expressions related to event information such as year expressions, temporal modifiers, and context terms for efficient event searches. We utilized a machine-learning technique of filtering noise to classify candidates into information or non-event information, using heuristic features and lexical patterns derived from a text-mining approach. Our experiment revealed that filtering achieved an 85% F-measure, and that query expansion could collect dozens more events than those without expansion. © 2011 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Futuristics; Futurology; Information retrieval; Scenario planning; Strategic foresight; Text mining; Vertical search","Classification (of information); Data mining; Expansion; Information filtering; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Futuristics; Futurology; Scenario Planning; Strategic foresight; Text mining; Vertical searches; Search engines",,,,,"Baeza-Yates, R., Searching the future (2005) ACM SIGIR, , Workshop MF/IR; Brun, P., Kawai, H., Kunieda, K., Yamada, K., Chronoseeker: Future opinion extraction and classification, 2009 (2009) IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence; Choudhury, M.D., Ssundaram, H., John, A., Seligman, D.D., Can blog communication dynamics be correlated with stock market activity?

Twelve mixes were made (three individual samples, three binary mixes and six ternary mixes), analyzed on the content of total reducing sugars, total titratable acidity and phenolic compounds; and adjusted, respectively, to the linear, quadratic and special cubic models. The results were organized in ternary charts of surface response and, from the overlap of these charts, it was determined a viable region which delimited the range of apple juice compositions that make musts physically and chemically suitable to sparkling drink elaboration. To represent the various possible combinations, the central point of the triangular area of the viable region was calculated and, this point, which represents the proportions of 23.22% of Catarina, 66.23% of Granny Smith and 10.55% of Pink Lady cultivars, was chosen to constitute the formulation of the must to be used in the elaboration of apple sparkling drinks.","Apple; Blend; Must; Statistical design","Lycoris squamigera; Malus x domestica; Oenothera speciosa",,,,,"Barros Neto, B., Scarminio, I.S., Bruns, R.E., (2007) Como fazer experimentos: Pesquisa e desenvolvimento na ciência e na indústria, p. 480. , 3. ed.

The true pacemakers of socialism were not the intellectuals or agitators who preached it but the Vanderbilts, Carnegies and Rockefellers. Joseph A. Schumpeter For Joseph Schumpeter, the heart of the capitalist system was the entrepreneur – an extraordinary individual who had the foresight to see profit in new products or production processes as well as the tenacity to overcome any obstacles that stood in the way. Schumpeter believed that the rise of large firms in the early 20th century was making the entrepreneur obsolete. By investing in in-house research and development (R&D) laboratories staffed by teams of engineers and scientists, large firms had routinized the process of innovation, “depersonalized and autonomatized” technological change, so that the incremental advances were realized “as a matter of course.” In such an environment not only did “personality and will power,” and thus the entrepreneur, “count for less,” but the greater efficiency of large-scale enterprises was undermining the small- and medium-size firms that historically had been the spawning ground for heroic innovators with radically new ideas about how to do things. These developments, Schumpeter foretold, would have profound consequences for the entire society. Because entrepreneurs were the primary political supports for “private property and free contracting,” their eclipse would pave the way for socialist revolution. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,,,,,"Schumpeter, J.A., (1950) Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, p. 134. , 3rd ed.

Methods: A model of breathing motion uncertainty was derived from previous robust optimization research. We then developed two algorithms ‐ exponential smoothing and running average ‐ to up‐date this model from fraction to fraction, using a sequence of retrospective motion probability mass functions (PMFs) from real patients. A robust optimization problem was solved for each fraction with an updated uncertainty model to generate a sequence of treatments. Delivery of the entire treatment was simulated and dose was accumulated according to the sequence of PMFs. The breathing motion model was created and updated in MATLAB, while CPLEX was used to solve the corresponding robust optimization problem as a linear program. The adaptive robust treatment was then compared with a robust treatment in which the uncertainty set was not updated over the treatment course. Results: Our adaptive robust optimization method exhibited a simultaneous improvement over non‐adaptive robust methods in both tumor coverage and healthy tissue sparing. The adaptive robust treatments were insensitive to the choice of the initial uncertainty model, and also closely comparable to idealized treatments that would be obtained with perfect foresight — i.e., treatments created with a priori knowledge of the entire sequence of future patient PMFs. Conclusions: By combining adaptive radiation therapy and robust optimization, our method combats both the instantaneous breathing motion uncertainty realized in each fraction and changes in the uncertainty that occur from fraction to fraction. Our method demonstrates that it is possible escalate dose to the tumor from the level possible with current robust methods without sacrificing healthy tissue sparing. © 2011, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The object is to ensure that any adoption of recent changes of approach in England, specifi cally those in and arising from Rahman and Bryce, is a matter of deliberate and informed choice. The article concludes that taking the subjective mens rea requirements for secondary party liability seriously requires taking Hong Kong's current strong agreement/ intention/knowledge requirements with respect to target offences seriously and guarding against dilution of actual foresight of possible collateral offences requirements by excessive abstraction of foreseen and committed acts. In other bwords, Rahman, Bryce and their progeny should be rejected.",,,,,,,"(1990) R v Mok Wai Tak and Another, 2, p. 333. , AC, 343H (PC); (1985) AC, 1, p. 168; (2006) Inchoate Liability for Assisting and Encouraging Crime LC, 300; (2006) Murder Manslaughter and Infanticide LC, 304; Participating in Crime LC (2007) Cm 7094 (Hereinafter ""Participating in Crime"", 302; note; (2007) Serious Crime Act, (C.27). , Part 2, Encouraging and Assisting Crime; Simester, A., The mental element in complicity (2006) LQR, 122, p. 578. , hereinafter ""Mental Element""; Virgo, G., Making sense of accessorial liability (2006) Archbold News, 6, pp. 6-9; Wilson, W., A rational scheme of liability for participating in crime (2008) Crim L R, 3; Sullivan, G.R., Participating in crime: Law com no. 305 - Joint criminal ventures (2008) Crim L R, 19; Taylor, R., Procuring, Causation, Innocent Agency and the Law Commission (2008) Crim L R, 32; Buxton, R., Joint enterprise (2009) Crim L R, 233; Sullivan, G.R., First degree murder and complicity - Conditions for parity of culpability between principal and accomplice (2007) Journal of Criminal Law and Philosophy, 1, p. 271; (2004) R v Bryce, 2, p. 35. , Cr App R (CA; (2009) R v Rahman, 1, p. 129. , AC; (2009) R v Yemoh (Kurtis, p. 930. , EWCA Crim; (2009) Crim LR, p. 888; Jackson, M., (2003) Criminal Law in Hong Kong, pp. 63-67. , Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press; LC, PART 4, p. 300. , discussed by Taylor, n 6 above; As Where P1 Threatens v with the Knife, P2 Steals V's Bag, Together Supplying the Actus Reus of Robbery; The Classic Case Is Murder Where Death Is Caused by A Combination of Injuries Inflicted by P1 and P2; Jackson, pp. 385-387. , n 8 above; note; note; Jackson, pp. 335-336. , n 8 above; Jackson, pp. 360-361. , n 8 above; (2006) HKSAR v Sung Pak Lun and Another CACC 215/2005, , 22 Aug; Ormerod, D., (2008) Smith and Hogan Criminal Law, p. 179. , at paras 26, 27, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 12th edn; (2009) HKSAR v Habib Ahmed CACC 400/2007, p. 8. , 16 Apr; Jackson, p. 337. , n 8 above; Simester Mental Element, pp. 598-599. , n 6 above; (2006) R v Clayton, R v Hartwick, R v Hartwick, 23 (1-11), p. 500. , ALR; Ormerod, pp. 206-208. , n 16 above; Smith, J.C., Criminal liability of accessories: Law and law reform (1997) LQR, 113, p. 453; Buxton, pp. 243-244. , n 6 above; (2010) R v Mendez and Another, 3 (17), p. 516. , EWCA Crim; All ER, 2010, p. 231; Simester Mental Element, pp. 592-598. , n 6 above; Jackson, p. 337. , n 8 above, 360-361; (2004) HKSAR v Sze Kwan Lung and Others, 7, p. 475. , HKCFAR, (CFA; (1995) R v Stewart and Schofield, 1, p. 447. , Cr App R 441; Clayton v the Queen, p. 20. , (n 17 above) at para; Clayton v the Queen, p. 20; That is, P used in the limited sense identifyed above (1998) Osland v R, 197, p. 316. , CLR; Sullivan, p. 23. , n 6 above; Buxton, p. 237. , n 6 above; (2001) HKSAR v Pun Ganga Chandra, 2 (2), p. 151. , HKLRD; (2002) HKEC, 8. , CFA; (2008) HKSAR v Lin Siu Lun CACC 10/2006, , 4 Feb; (1999) R v Uddin, p. 431. , QB; EWCA Crim (2005) Attorney-General's Reference 3 of 2004, p. 1882; R v Greatex (1999) Cr App R, 1, p. 126; (1999) R v Powell and Daniels, R v English, p. 1. , AC; , pp. 33-35. , n 19 above paras; (2005) HKSAR v Wu Wai Fung CACC 523/2004, p. 54. , 9 Dec, at para; (2009) HKSAR v Cheung Chi Keung FACC 9/2008, p. 22. , 9 Mar, at para; (2000) R v Powell, English Has Been Cited in Many Other HK Cases, Including HKSAR v Chueng Moon Keung, 4, p. 92. , HKC; (2000) HKSAR v Sham Ying Kit, 4, p. 380. , HKC; (2001) HKSAR v Mok Tsan Ping and Others, 2, p. 325. , HKLRD; Pun Ganga Chandra (2, , n 22 above; (2008) Wu Wai Fung Ibid.

The network is comprised of the macrocells underlaid with femtocells. The objective of each station in the network is to maximize its capacity under power constraints. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game with the macrocell base stations as the leaders and the femtocell access points as the followers. The leaders are assumed to have enough information and foresight to consider the response of the followers while formulating their strategies. To characterize such interaction between leaders and followers, Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced; and it is shown to exist under the assumption of continuity of best response function of the leader sub-game. ©2010 IEEE.","Cellular network; Femtocell; Game theory; Stackelberg equilibrium","Access points; Best response; Cellular network; Downlink power allocation; Femtocell; Macro cells; Power constraints; Stackelberg equilibrium; Stackelberg Games; Cellular neural networks; Game theory; Mobile telecommunication systems; Telecommunication; Wireless networks",,,,,"Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Gatherer, A., Femtocell networks: A survey (2008) Comm.

This chapter focuses purely on the technical nature of cyberattacks. It examines the current relationship between networked systems and cybercrimes, analyzes the nature of the relationship from a fundamental engineering perspective, and explores systematically where and how future advances in networked systems might influence the evolution of cyberattacks, even inadvertently giving rise to new forms of cybercrimes. Historical data reveals that technological advances in engineering systems design, including communications and transportation, were often accompanied by lack of foresight, thereby inadvertently opening doors to new forms of vulnerabilities following deployment. The greater the extent of the advancement, the deeper the potential chasm and more severe the damage incurred when a clever perpetrator successfully exploits the weaknesses. For example, when the Bell Telephone System employed human operators to switch telephone calls in the early 1900s, anonymous and unauthorized long distance calls were a rarity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,,,,"(2001) Hackers: Computer Outlaws, , The Learning Channel, July 25, Cable Television; Pillalamarri, S., Ghosh, S., The impact of source traffic distribution on quality of service (QoS) in ATM networks (2001) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, pp. 2855-2859. , June 11-15; Lessig, W., (2001) The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in the Connected World, , New York, NY: Random House; Ghosh, S., (2002) Principles of Secure Network Systems Design, , April, New York, NY: Springer; Annual International Working Conference on Active Networks, , http://www.iwan2002.org, Retrieved December 4-6, 2002, from; Ghosh, S., Computer virus attacks on the rise: Causes, mitigation, and the future (2002) Financial IT Decisions 2002, 1, pp. 16-17. , http://www.wsta.org;, 1, Feb/Mar, a Bi-Annual Technology Publication of the Wall Street Technology Association, Red Bank, New Jersey.

It represents a continuing tradition of change and innovation that has been most evident in recent revisions of the scale. This chapter provides an overview of the scale's historical and contemporary foundations. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition reflects the culmination of over 70 years of progressive revisions to the Wechsler line of adult intelligence measures. Wechsler's foresight in defining intelligence in practical terms has allowed the very flexibility needed for ongoing revisions to his intelligence scales in light of advances in theory, research, and the measurement of intelligence. The most recent editions of the Wechsler intelligence scales have involved dramatic changes based on burgeoning research advances in neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, and contemporary intelligence theory, as well as increasing sophistication in psychological measurement. Despite these substantial innovations, some critics perpetuate the myth that the Wechsler intelligence scales are outdated or atheoretical. This chapter elaborates on Wechsler's views about intelligence and the progressive adaptations to his intelligence scales in light of contemporary theory and research. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

When it comes to seeking 'game-changing' advances, the situation is even more challenging. First, research aimed at revolutionary advancements is different from just improving technology. On both the individual and organization level, it is natural to doubt the viability of new, unfamiliar concepts. Foresight is required to extend beyond the known in combination with rigor to make genuine progress. Additionally, such research can span multiple disciplines and different levels of progress and applicability. And lastly, on topics that appear far from fruition, available resources are minimal. To address these challenges and provide insights for managing projects aimed at 'game-changing' advances, historic lessons are compiled and condensed to provide a set of recommendations that include: combining vision and rigor, separate revolutionary research from taking care of existing business, devise separate prioritization criteria, break long-range goals into shorter-term important questions, judge rigor instead of feasibility, define success as gaining reliable knowledge, and embrace failures.

In reply, I will argue that we should draw a distinction between (i) facing stronger temptations to offend when one offended and (ii) acting on stronger temptations in offending. The distinction is analogous to Antony Duff's distinction between having a reason for an action and acting on/for that reason. After drawing the distinction, I will argue that while acting on stronger temptations in offending should be a mitigating factor, facing stronger temptations to offend per se should not be a mitigating factor. Moreover, I will argue that since it is not true that deprived offenders generally act on stronger temptations in offending, social deprivation cannot be defended as a general mitigating plea on the basis that deprived offenders generally act on stronger temptations in offending. © The Author 2010.

The components interact in such a way as to maintain sets of essential variables to within critical ranges in the face of an externally imposed regime of perturbations. The Daisystat model is presented that bears a number of similarities to Ashby's Homeostat but which can also be considered as a higher dimensional version of the Watson & Lovelock Daisyworld model that sought to explain how homeostasis operating at the planetary scale may arise in the absence of foresight or planning. The Daisystat model features a population of diverse individuals that affect and are affected by the environment in different ways. The Daisystat model extends Daisyworld in that homeostasis is observed with systems comprised of four environmental variables and beyond. It is shown that the behaviour of the population is analogous to the 'uniselector' in the Homeostat in that rapid changes in the population allows the system to 'search' for stable states. This allows the system to find and recover homeostatic states in the face of externally applied perturbations. It is proposed that the Daisystat may afford insights into the evolution of increasingly complex systems such as the Earth system.",,"Earth systems; Environmental variables; Higher-dimensional; Physical devices; Planetary scale; Stable state; Biological systems; Physiology",,,,,"Ashby, W.R., (1956) Introduction to Cybernetics, , Chapman and Hall, London; Ashby, W.R., (1960) Design for a Brain, , Chapman and Hall, London, 2nd edition; Clynes, M., Cybernetic implications of rein control in perceptual and conceptual organization (1969) Annals of New York Academy of Science, 156, pp. 629-670; Di Paolo, E., Noble, J., Bullock, S., Simulation models as opaque thought experiments (2000) Artificial Life VII, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems, pp. 497-506. , Bedau, M.

It is assessed by analyzing 22 years of both satellite observations of vegetation activity (e.g. NDVI) and climatic data (precipitation, temperature). The specific influence of non-spatial climatic indices such as NAO and SOI is also addressed. The approaches considered for rainfall forecasting include classical Auto-Regressive Moving-Average with Exogenous Inputs (ARMAX) models and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the so-called Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in particular. The use of neural models is proven to be an adequate mathematical prediction tool in this problem due the non-linearity of the problem. These models enable us to predict, with one month foresight, the general rainfall dynamics, with average errors of 44 mm (RMSE) in a test series of 4 years with a rainfall standard deviation equal to 73 mm. Also, the sensitivity analysis in the neural network models reveals that observations in the status of the vegetation cover in previous months have a predictive power greater than other considered variables. Linear models yield average results of 55 mm (RMSE) although they need a large number of error terms (12) to obtain acceptable models. Nevertheless, they provide means for assessing the seasonal influence of the precipitation regime with the aid of linear dummy regression parameters, thereby offering an immediate interpretation (e.g. coherent maps) of the causality between vegetation cover and rainfall. © 2010, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Adams, J., (2007) Vegetation-Climate Interaction.

Lessons include: Scenarios using 'aspirational futures' should include expectable, challenging, and visionary alternatives; beware of and understand 'allergic reactions' to foresight given some individuals', particularly leaders', psychological preferences; foresight is most effectively done by and for top leadership but foresight for units or regions of the organization can also be successful; to get the most value, it is important to err on the side of boldness and vision in developing scenarios; foresight efforts create a 'safe space' for exploring challenging situations; associations as collections of companies or professionals have unique foresight needs including elected leadership that rotates every year, and the need to communicate the results of foresight efforts to their members effectively; government and corporations have more similarities than differences in foresight, but companies have more resources and can move quickly to develop and use the foresight. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","'Allergic reactions' to foresight; 'Aspirational futures'; Foresight lessons; Government and corporate foresight","'Aspirational futures'; Allergic reactions; Foresight lessons; Government and corporate foresight; Non profit organizations; Strategic foresight; Association reactions; Profitability; Industry; corporate strategy; future prospect; government; prediction; strategic approach",,,,,"(1978) Anticipatory Democracy: People in the Politics of the Future, , Random House, New York, C.

Freshly and cooked sausages was investigated of sensory changes and nutrient composition. Sensory analyses, pH values and mature sausages' nutrient composition of between two sausages groups were not differents P>0.05). The cook sausages were including of 100% fish meat of protein and fat values higher than calf meat sausages (P<0.05).

In this short essay, the author focuses on a number of specific topics which reveal both Röling's foresight and his specific understanding of the individual suspect's predicament when charged with international crimes. It is in this light that key issues such as Röling's ideas about individual responsibility and the crime of aggression, or the superior responsibility of civilians standing in the dock at Tokyo, are addressed, along with an assessment of Röling's position on related concepts such as duress and mistake of law. The essay concludes with some reflections on Röling's general ideas and views on the functions and aims of international criminal law. Above all, the essay highlights Röling's intellect and realism when dealing with international criminal law, and foregrounds this kind and humane man's life-long search for even-handed justice. © Oxford University Press, 2010, All rights reserved.",,,,,,,"Teunissen, P.J., A Humanist for Peace (1977) Declarations on Principles; A Quest for Universal Peace, pp. XVII-XVII10. , For a vivid portrait, R.J.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper utilizes the equations of flow equilibrium to determine the variations of film thickness or displacement of loading table with respect to the varying of recess pressure. For a hydrostatic bearing whose recess pressures are controlled by compensations, the stiffness characteristics can be presented directly by these variations. Findings - The usage range of recess pressure and compensation parameters should be selected to correspond to a variation with smallest gradient. Originality/value - This paper proposes an extensive database as a critical requirement for the selection of types and parameters of the compensation as to yield the acceptable or optimized characteristics in design of hydrostatic bearings. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Although oil is a vital commodity, potential supply disruptions are less worrisome than scholars, politicians, and pundits presume. This article identifies four adaptive mechanisms that together can compensate for almost all oil shocks, meaning that continuous supply to consumers will limit scarcity-induced price increases. The adaptive mechanisms are not particularly fragile and do not require tremendous foresight by either governments or economic actors. We illustrate these mechanisms at work using evidence from every major oil disruption since 1973. We then identify the small subset of disruptive events that would overwhelm these adaptive mechanisms and therefore seriously harm the United States. Finally, we analyze the utility of U.S. foreign military policy tools in addressing these threats. Our findings suggest that the United States can defend its key interests in the Persian Gulf-the world's most important oil-producing region-with a less-intrusive, ""over the horizon"" posture. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"http://www.eia.doe.gov, Note; (2006) National Security Consequences of U.S. Oil Dependency, pp. 48-49+53+56-59. , Council on Foreign Relations, Independent Task Force Report no. 58, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, October; Crane, K., Goldthau, A., Toman, M., Johnson, S.E., Nader, A., Rabasa, A., Dogo, H., (2009) Imported Oil and U.S. National Security, , Santa Monica:, RAND Corporation; (1998) A National Security Strategy for a New Century, pp. 6+12-13+32-33+52+54. , Note; Barnes, J., Jaffe, A., Morse Edward, L., (2004) The New Geopolitics of Oil,"" the National Interest, , Note; Rutledge, I., (2005) Addicted to Oil: America's Relentless Drive For Energy Security, pp. 7+132+197-198. , London:, I.B.

There are then real options to change these factors based on what is learned. The case of launching product variants in parallel is also considered.

Meanwhile, encouragement of individual self-interest chews up the social fabric of trust, respect and mutual assistance upon which all lasting commerce and well-being depend. Society has always found it necessary to intervene to protect itself from raw market behavior.

We point beyond the well-tilled ground of foresight as commonly practiced (called Foresight 1.0) to an emerging understanding of the work and character of foresight (called Foresight 2.0). By definition, as of today, this new territory is not well mapped, much less carefully worked-over. The question that drives this commitment to Foresight 2.0 was the heart of the 2007 Strathclyde Organizational Foresight Conference-Learning the Future Faster: "" Can foresight as commonly practiced enable us to learn the future fast enough to meet and deal with the unique strategic challenges of the 21st Century?"" The view taken is that Foresight 1.0 cannot meet this challenge; that it leads to small victories and major disasters. An explanation is offered: Foresight 1.0 was developed, and is still largely practiced, with the eyes and mind of management, whereas sustained success in the unique conditions of the 21st Century requires Foresight 2.0-seeing, thinking and acting with the eyes and mind of Leadership. This distinction is explained. Evidence is offered that futures research and foresight are slowly moving towards this new practice. The hope is expressed that, if we grasp the need for it, the nature of it and have explicit mental maps of the journey to it, we who are professional foresight researchers and practitioners will move faster and more effectively to develop Foresight 2.0.

We have adopted a social practice perspective, which we base within an interpretative world view, to better understand how organisational foresight is enacted. This offers a reading of the phenomena, of which the essential contribution is that organisational foresight is more than an organisational property; it is something that reflective people do as they engage with various inputs from the outside and as a result of the continuous interaction between activity systems and their constituting elements. A longitudinal case study illustrates the importance of understanding the construction of collective and individual meaning in working with organisational foresight. The study shows how the inherent rigidity of the existing activity system and the weak ties between these diverse subsets of the organisation may block the interaction between emerging social practices and organisational intentions resulting in ongoing failures of understanding and enactment. A model is developed to include these parameters in an augmented activity systems model. Based on this we have identified the linking of organisational levels as one of the key dimensions to be considered for which the social practice perspective holds significant explanatory strength. © 2009.",,"future prospect; organizational framework; perception",,,,,"Stacey, R.D., (2003) Strategic Management and Organisational Dynamics, , Prentice Hall, Harlow, UK; Mintzberg, H., The fall and rise of strategic planning (1994) Harvard Business Review, pp. 107-114. , January-February; Balogun, J., Johnson, G., From intended strategies to unintended outcomes: the impact of change recipient sensemaking (2005) Organisation Studies, 26 (11), pp. 1573-1601; Weick, K.E., (2001) Making Sense of the Organization, , Blackwell Business; Smircich, L., Stubbart, C., Strategic management in an enacted world (1985) Academy of Management Review, 10 (4), pp. 724-736; Weick, K.E., (1995) Sensemaking in Organizations, p. 31. , Sage Publications, London; Van der Heijden, K., Can internally generated futures accelerate organizational learning?

Although trends are considered to be important drivers of environmental discontinuities which may lead to strategic surprises, there is no operationalization from a strategic point of view. In this paper we are going to conceptualize trends as (socio-cultural) innovations. This leads to important implications. If the nature of innovation is taken seriously, then strategic trend diagnosis has to deal with two different aspects, invention and diffusion. First, we are going to present a framework for identifying the invention aspect of a trend (i.e., "" the new"" ) which is based on the fact that "" the new"" results from a transgression of contextual boundaries. Second, we are going to operationalize the diffusion of "" the new"" as a threefold process of normalization - i.e., an unusual practice becomes social convention. Taken together, these two aspects provide a theoretical link between trends and market creation. In addition, by relating the above operationalizations to an entrepreneurial strategy-making framework, strategic issue diagnosis can be improved and more seamlessly linked to strategy formulation. © 2009.",,"conceptual framework; entrepreneur; future prospect; innovation; market development; organizational framework; planning theory; strategic approach; technology diffusion; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , The Macmillian Company, New York; Keegan, W.J., (1967), Scanning the International Business Environment, Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, Boston; Bright, J.R., Evaluating signals of technological change (1970) Harvard Business Review, 48, pp. 62-70; Bright, J.R., Forecasting by monitoring signals of technological change (1973) A Guide to Practical Technological Forecasting, pp. 238-256. , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, J.R.

Social constructionists and organizational theorists have indicated that the future of an organization can be enacted by its constituents. Yet it is apparent that scenario planning techniques, used by organizations to plan for their future, tend to emphasize a future that the organization must react to instead of create. By emphasizing a future that the organizations must react to, it may ignore and completely miss the opportunity it has to create or enact the future it wants to have.Scenario planning, however, can evolve to support a creative foresight and approach to the future by recognizing the power behind enactment theory and applying a goal-oriented approach to the scenario planning process. Using goal-oriented scenario planning an organization can match the world it wants with the world it expects to see. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"corporate strategy; planning method; social construction",,,,,"Brand, S., (1999) The Clock of the Long Now, , Basic Books, New York; Chermack, T.J., Lynham, S.A., Ruona, W.E.A., A review of scenario planning literature (2001) Futures Research Quarterly, pp. 7-31. , Summer; Mietzner, D., Reger, G., Advantages and disadvantages of scenario approaches for strategic foresight (2005) International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning, 1 (2), pp. 220-239; Mankins, M.C., Steele, R., Stop making plans, start making decisions (2006) Harvard Business Review, pp. 76-84. , January; Schoemaker, P.J.H., Scenario planning, a tool for strategic thinking (1995) MIT Sloan Management Review, pp. 25-40. , Winter; Weick, K., (1979) The Social Psychology of Organizing, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Mir, R., Watson, A., Strategic management and the philosophy of science: the case for a constructivist methodology, Strategic Management Journal 21 (2000), pp. 941-953; Raimond, P., Two styles of foresight: are we predicting the future or inventing it?

The purpose of the study is to discuss the existing practice, position the IDEAS and SAGES methods, and outline their contribution to the state of the art. Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the form of a literature study and conceptual discussion, illustrated with a case example of electronically mediated scenario methods. Findings: Both of the presented scenario methods, i.e. IDEAS and SAGES, are feasible means to compose scenarios. The methods can be positioned respectively to intuitive-logical and heuristic schools of thought. The contribution to existing practice is that they consume fewer resources than do their more traditional counterparts. Research limitations/implications: The empirical validation of the presented methods is presently limited to case studies. Thus, the authors invite practitioners and researchers to examine the methods and to discuss the applicability of the results. Practical implications: The IDEAS and SAGES methods offer tools for practicing managers to conduct scenario planning with practitioners and experts in a flexible and effective manner. Originality/value: The paper adds to the ongoing discussion on business and technology foresight by presenting the novel scenario methods, and positioning them explicitly to the existing practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Conferencing; Forecasting; Group decision support systems; Organizational planning; Project planning",,,,,,"Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of Futures Studies, 1-2. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ; Bergman, J.-P., Supporting knowledge creation and sharing in the early phases of the strategic innovation process (2005) Acta Universitatis Lappeenrantaesis, p. 212. , Lappeenranta University of Technology; Blanning, R.W., Reinig, B.A., A framework for conducting political event analysis using group support systems (2005) Decision Support Systems, 38, pp. 511-527; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K.-H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario types and techniques: Towards a user's guide (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 723-739; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., van der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37, pp. 795-812; Chermack, T.J., Improving decision-making with scenario planning (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 295-309; Chermack, T.J.L., van der Merwe, L., The role of constructivist learning in scenario planning (2003) Futures, 35, pp. 445-460; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152; Courtney, H., Decision-driven scenarios for assessing four levels of uncertainty (2003) Strategy & Leadership, 31 (1), pp. 14-22; Forrester, J.W., From the ranch to system dynamics: An autobiography (1992) Management Laureates: A Collection of Autobiographical Essays, 1. , Bedeian, A.G.

Rationale underlines foresight and suggests that targeting on a national goal, foresight as a knowledge network system is similar to the coordinating mechanism as any decision supporting system. This paper argues that the way of knowledge organised and the relevant policy formulated be more closely related to the structure of decision support network of a nation. The transaction-cost explanation helps reshape the organisation of foresight institutions in their role and rights structure.

We argue that social influences can produce two observable effects: (1) discontinuities in unconditional adoption curves and (2) pattern reversals in conditional adoption curves, in which earlier adoption is found for one group of actors versus another when fundamentals suggest the reverse ordering should occur; in turn the presence of either of these features can, under weak assumptions, be interpreted as evidence of social influences.

The Ken Wilber inspired integral futures, developed by Richard Slaughter and others, and put forth as the most comprehensive approach to-date, is critiqued and assessed. While Wilber's integral and the variant it has inspired in futures represent significant innovations, it also contains the tendency to un-necessarily close down, lock out or to sub-ordinate alternative conceptions of holism, what I term 'Wilber-ism'. Wilber's 'theory of everything' and integral futures are analysed, re-assessed and re-situated in the context of the alternative approaches to holism that exist. What emerges is a rich view of potential genealogies and ontogenies as movements toward holism. One variant from the action research tradition, which I call 'integrative foresight', is put forward as an example of an alternative. The article concludes by proposing a process of dynamic dialogue between diverse conceptions of holism, which can at once honour the great diversity of approaches, while likewise continuing the journey of creating shared meaning and common understandings of the complex contexts in which futures inquiry works. © 2009.",,"conceptual framework; future prospect; holistic approach; prediction",,,,,"Gidley, J., The evolution of consciousness as a planetary imperative: an integration of integral views (2007) Integral Review, 5; Slaughter, R., (2004) Futures Beyond Dystopia: Creating Social Foresight, , Routledge Falmer, London; Slaughter, R., A new framework for environmental scanning (1999) Foresight, 1 (6); Wilber, K., (2000) Integral Psychology: Consciousness, Spirit, Psychology, Therapy, , Shambhala, Boston; Wilber, K., (2000) A Theory of Everything: An Integral Vision for Business, Politics, Science, and Spirituality, , Shambhala, Boston; Latour, B., (2005) Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor Network Theory, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bourdieu, P., (1998) Practical Reason: On the Theory of Action, , Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA; Hampson, G., Integral re-views postmodernism: the way out is through (2007) Integral Review, 4, pp. 108-173; Tertulian, N., Lukaks, Adorno and classical German philosophy (1985) Telos, 63, p. 91; Slaughter, R., What difference does 'integral' make?

The authors describe the different stages of the method. It begins with a static graphic description of the system that will then be made dynamic through the identification of processes and quantified by state variables. This phase is of utmost importance since it provides the foundation for everything that follows. The most important processes are then transformed into hypotheses that either come to be or do not, one of the central points of the approach, before establishing a matrix of the influences of each hypothesis on the others. Breaking down these hypotheses into clusters of hypotheses that are more closely related among themselves than to the others allows us to build microscenarios. The idea of a scenario is discussed. The possibility of global scenarios and macroscenarios is explained. The presentation concludes with a discussion of research and action strategies. The conclusion focuses on the advantages of foresight studies for organizations, whether they are research oriented or not. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The generational interplay has many different facets and can be looked at from many various perspectives. This paper looks at a broader role of young people as agents of cultural change in societies, their relation to futures studies and the implications of their fresh ways of thinking for futures methods. Also, the past evolution of futures methods and the challenges facing the present and future generation of futurists in regard to methodological as well as general development are reviewed. In an effort to draw together these issues and provide practical ways forward for futurists and their field four integrating themes are addressed:•Allowing for differences, how do we develop solidarity between generations?•What does the near-future outlook tell us that might help to achieve this?•What personal, organisational and social capacities are needed?•What methods are available for building social foresight? © 2009.",,"conference proceeding; future prospect; methodology",,,,,"Gáspár, T., Nováky, E., Dilemmas for renewal of futures methodology (2002) Futures, 34, pp. 365-379; Hronszky, Drawing a historical lesson: toward prospective technology studies?, in: Futures Generation for Future Generations, Budapest, 2005, e-book [www.budapestfutures.org]; K.

Using agents' minimum foresight concerning possible future payoffs, Maskin and Tirole (Rev Econ Stud 66:83-114, 1999) show that indescribability does not matter for contractual incompleteness as long as there is symmetric information at both the contracting stage and the trading stage. This is called the irrelevance theorem. The following generalization of the irrelevance theorem is shown here: indescribability does not matter even in the presence of asymmetric information at the trading stage, as long as there is symmetric information at the contracting stage. This is an important clarification because Kunimoto (Econ Lett 99:367-370, 2008) shows that indescribability can matter if there is asymmetric information at both stages. It is thus argued that asymmetric information at the contracting stage is necessary for indescribability to be important in the rational agents contracting model. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Asymmetric information; Bayesian implementation; Incentive compatibility; Incomplete contracts; Indescribability; Individual rationality; Irrelevance theorem",,,,,,"Che, Y.-K., Hausch, D., Cooperative investments and the value of contracting (1999) Am Econ Rev, 89, pp. 125-147; Dewatripont, M., Tirole, J., Modes of communication (2005) J Polit Econ, 113, pp. 1217-1238; Grossman, S.J., Hart, O.D., The costs and benefits of ownership: A theory of vertical and lateral integration (1986) J Polit Econ, 94, pp. 691-719; Hart, O., Moore, J., Property rights and the nature of the firm (1990) J Polit Econ, 98, pp. 1119-1158; Hart, O., Moore, J., Foundations of incomplete contracts (1999) Rev Econ Stud, 66, pp. 115-138; Kunimoto, T., Indescribability and asymmetric information at the contracting stage (2008) Econ Lett, 99, pp. 367-370; Maskin, E., On indescribable contingencies and incomplete contracts (2002) Eur Econ Rev, 46, pp. 725-733; Maskin, E., Tirole, J., Unforeseen contingencies and incomplete contracts (1999) Rev Econ Stud, 66, pp. 83-114; Mookherjee, D., Reichelstein, S., Implementation via augmented revelation mechanisms (1990) Rev Econ Stud, 57, pp. 453-475; Segal, I., Complexity and renegotiation: A foundation for incomplete contracts (1999) Rev Econ Stud, 66, pp. 57-82; Tirole, J., Incomplete contracts: Where do we stand?

Whereas these approaches have treated all competing firms equally as Nash players, one firm may have an advantage over its rivals, e. g., more pre-experience on competitors' behavior and/or a first-mover advantage. This paper proposes a Stackelberg-Nash (leader-followers) model which can accomodate such information for decision making. The optimal product design problem is formulated from the perspective of a profit-maximizing new entrant (the leader) who wants to launch a brand onto an existing product market and acts with foresight by anticipating price-design reactions of the incumbent firms (the Nash followers). In the absence of closed-form solutions, we use a sequential iterative procedure to compute a Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium and to establish its uniqueness. The new conjoint model is illustrated under several competitive scenarios and price, design and profit implications are compared to a simple Nash equilibrium model. We find that a Stackelberg leader strategy may not only yield a much higher profit for the new entrant than a Nash strategy, but may also lead to strong profit asymmetries between competitors with still higher profits for the incumbent firms. In other words, the incumbent firms may also benefit strongly from a new entrant choosing a Stackelberg leader strategy. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Conjoint analysis; Game theory; Optimal product design; Product competition",,,,,,"Albers, S., Brockhoff, K., A comparison of two approaches to the optimal positioning of a new product in an attribute space (1979) Zeitschrift Opera Res, 23, pp. 127-142; Albritton, M.D., McMullen, P.R., Optimal product design using a colony of virtual ants (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 176, pp. 498-520; Alexouda, G., An evolutionary algorithm approach to the share of choices problem in the product line design (2004) Computers Oper Res, 31, pp. 2215-2229; Alexouda, G., Paparrizos, K., A genetic algorithm approach to the product line design problem using the seller's return criterion: An extensive comparative computational study (2001) Eur J Oper Res, 134, pp. 165-178; Aubin, J.P., (1979) Mathematical Methods of Game and Economic Theory, , Amsterdam: North-Holland; Baier, D., Methoden der Conjoint-Analyse in der Marktforschungs- und Marketingpraxis (1999) Mathematische Methoden Der Wirtschaftswissenschaften, Festschrift für Otto Opitz, pp. 197-206. , W.

Sharing various experiences and opinions, by exchanging diaries or comments, promoted the pre-service teachers' reflection on their daily working experience.

Two construction types were represented in the project, masonry cavity and light steel frame. Phase 1 of the project sought to assess in detail the design, construction and air permeability of 25 dwellings that were constructed to conform to the requirements of Approved Document Part L1 2002. While the total number of dwellings reported here is small, the results suggest that there is not a consistent approach to the way in which developers present information on air leakage to those on site, a mixture of approaches are utilised on site to achieve the same specification and there appears to be a lack of foresight in the detailed design stage, resulting in specifications that are practically very difficult to achieve. Despite this, the air permeability results suggest that dwellings constructed with a wet/mechanically plastered internal finish, can default to a reasonable standard of airtightness by UK standards, without much additional attention being given to airtightness.","Air leakage; Airtightness; Housing; Pressurisation testing","Air leakage; Airtightness; Design and construction; Detailed design; Key message; Light steel frames; Masonry cavities; Participatory action research; Phase 1; Air permeability; Apartment houses; Housing; Project management; Research; Specifications; Buildings",,,,,"Borland, S., Bell, M., (2003) Airtightness of Buildings - Towards Higher Performance, , A Project Proposal to ODPM Building Regulations Division Under the Building Operational Performance Framework.

Within the first year the newly formed group grew in membership to several hundred, sponsored technical sessions at the National Electronic Conference, Acoustical Society Symposium, and IRE National Convention, and had published the first issue of the Transactions. The IRE Group chose as its focus, ultrasonic measurements, communications, and processing, with emphasis on applications, devices, techniques, and associated circuitry. In 1985 we became the IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control (UFFC) Society to reflect the expanded interests of the membership. The UFFC Society sponsors three annual Symposia; the International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS), the International Symposium on the Application of Ferroelectrics (ISAF) and the International Frequency Control Symposium (IFCS). In the past 56 years our Society has grown and flourished as a top technical IEEE society through its symposia, publications, member sponsorship and awards, and its cooperative activities with other technical societies.

Previous research focused on the short run because of a widespread belief that in the long run the market reverts to well-established fundamentals. The authors' research suggests this belief should be questioned. First, they show actual dividends cannot account for the secular trends of stock market values. They then consider a more comprehensive measure of capital income, which displays large secular fluctuations that roughly coincide with changes in stock market trends. Under perfect foresight, however, this measure fails to properly account for stock market movements. The authors thus abandon the perfect foresight assumption and instead assume that forecasts of future capital income are performed using a distributed lag equation and information available up to the forecasting period only. They find that standard asset-pricing theory can be reconciled with the secular trends in the stock market. This study, nevertheless, leaves open an important puzzle for asset-pricing theory: The market value of U.S. corporations was much lower than the replacement cost of corporate tangible assets from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. © 2009, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",,,,,,,"Barsky, R.B., de Long, J.B., Why Does the Stock Market Fluctuate?

However, the author also stated that tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome might differ from essential tremor. A 71-year-old man with Klinefelter's syndrome who suffers from postural hand tremor is described. The electromyogram indicated lower motor neuron disturbance and chronic neurogenic change. The muscle biopsy indicated neurogenic muscle atrophy. Upon testosterone administration, the amplitude of tremor was reduced and a gradual improvement in handwriting was observed. The tremor in this patient was different from essential tremor. The foresight by Baughman in 1969 proved to be true in this patient.

These systems have a common feature: under perfect foresight (or rational expectations) they all possess a unique fixed point steady state. This long-term outcome is obtained also under learning if the quality underlying the learning process is high. Otherwise, when the degree of inefficiency of the learning process is relatively strong, nonlinear dynamics (periodic and a-periodic cycles) arise. The specific properties of each one of the proposed systems is explored both in terms of local and global dynamics. One macroeconomic model is used to illustrate how the formation of expectations through learning may eventually lead to awkward long-term outcomes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper outlines the overall approach and the methods it employed, along with some implications and emerging themes from this first iteration. Findings – The paper casts new light on patterns of activity in the futures/foresight arena that, in turn, lead to policy questions, including those of purpose and effectiveness. Originality/value – The SoPiFF project is of interest not only for its early results, but also for the use of the metascanning methodology outlined here. At one level it draws attention to the nature of the foresight practitioner's toolkit. At another it may also help to guide decisions about future resourcing options and the nature of training that is offered within the domain. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Forecasting; Forward planning; International cooperation; Research",,,,,,"Australian Foresight Institute (AFI) monograph series on social foresight (2004-2006), available at: www.swin.edu.au/agse/courses/foresight/monographs.htm.

This paper examines Dian's Foresight Styles Assessment (FSA) to determine whether there is sufficient empirical support for its six proposed styles of foresight: Futurist, Activist, Opportunist, Flexist, Equilibrist, and Reactionist. Factor analysis was used to examine a sample of 3,154 knowledge workers to reveal a four factor solution of Framer, Adapter, Tester, and Reactor. The first and last factors partially matched Dian's original conceptualization of Futurist and Reactionist. The four new factors, when taken together, explained 41.72% of the variance with scale reliability ranging from .66 to .89. Item analysis eliminated 19 questions from the FSA that had relatively lower correlations with items in their set. The refined 26-item FSA is a valid and reliable instrument with construct validity, although further efforts could be undertaken to locate Dian's original factors.","Assessments; Cognitive styles; Diffusion innovation; Factor analysis; Foresight; Futures studies; Leadership; Quantitative research; Strategic foresight; Temporal perspective",,,,,,"Ackoff, R.L., (1969) A concept of corporate planning, , New York: Wiley-Interscience; Argyris, Chris, Putnam, R., Smith, M.D., (1985) Action science, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; Aritzeta, A., Barbara, S., Swailes, S., Team role preference and cognitive styles: A convergent validity study (2005) Small Group Research, 36 (4), pp. 404-436. , August; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice-Hall; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York: W.H.

This relies on an available seismotectonic zonation and earthquake catalogue, but makes use of a set of very recent, expressly developed attenuation relations. The long period picture of ground motion hazard is illustrated vis-à-vis the conventional one based on ground acceleration, and the feasibility of simple approximations of the displacement spectra, useful for design purposes, is shown. We give some foresight on the differences to be expected in hazard maps resulting from the use of a predominantly fault-based seismic source model, as opposed to the more conventional model that includes only spatially extended zones. Finally, we highlight the different hazard exposure of different regions depending on whether we represent hazard with a long or a short period parameter and we discuss the adequacy of recent code provisions regarding elastic displacement spectra. © 2009, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.",,"Conventional models; Displacement response spectra; Elastic displacements; Elastic response spectra; Fault-based; Ground accelerations; Ground motion hazard; Hazard map; Seismic hazards; Seismic source; Seismotectonics; Short periods; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Geotechnical engineering; Hazards",,,,,"Abrahamson, N.A., State of practice of seismic hazard evaluation (2000) Proceedings of GeoEng 2000, , Melbourne, Australia; Akkar, S., Bommer, J.J., Prediction of elastic displacement response spectra in Europe and the Middle East (2007) Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics, 36 (10), pp. 1275-1301. , DOI 10.1002/eqe.679; Baker, F., Korista, S.D., Novak, L.C., Engineering the world's tallest-Burj Dubai (2008) Proc.

In the Kumano Basin, there are two seafloor benchmarks that are located about 60 and 80 km away from the deformation front of the Nankai Trough, respectively. The observations from 2005 to 2008 have illustrated that these benchmarks are moving at rates of about 5-6 cm/yr with uncertainties of 1-3 cm/yr relative to the stable Amurian plate. In this study, in order to estimate interplate coupling along the Nankai Trough, we calculated surface deformations accompanied with plate subduction in an elastic half-space and compared them with on- and offshore GPS velocities obtained by GPS/Acoustic technique. Then, we investigated the effect of observation for the seafloor crustal deformations on slip resolution on the plate interface. We conclude that offshore crustal deformation data provide good constraints for the estimation of fault slips at the shallower part of the plate interface, especially at the depths of 10-20 km, where slip resolution is low without using offshore geodetic data. Future additional crustal deformation observations on the seafloor would lead to the better estimation of seafloor velocities, which help us receal strain accumulation process in the seismogenic subduction zone during interseismic period.",,"coupling; crustal deformation; estimation method; seafloor; subduction; uncertainty analysis; Kumano Basin; Nankai Trough; Pacific Ocean",,,,,"Altamimi, Z., P.

The key element of our approach, the so-called variation analysis, is a methodology to identify coherent socio-technical and organizational variants within a specific innovation field. Consistent combinations of these two dimensions may be interpreted as nuclei for alternative future developments of innovation systems. The method may be used in discursive foresight processes to inform strategy formulation of firms or policy makers who see a utility in furthering the innovation field. The paper has a focus on developing the theoretical background and the analytical structure of the methodology. Empirically, we illustrate the method for the innovation system of biomass digestion in Switzerland. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, foresight, future outlooks and scenarios are, as a rule, based on inductivist or deductivist methods, making looking into the future a form of conservative projecting of past and present probabilities onto the road of development lying ahead of us. Closed past or present outlooks give birth to open futures, but these futures usually are little more than exercises in organizational learning. In this paper we present and develop a method for futures research that is based on abductive logic. Abduction-based futures research approach proceeds from closed, imaginary future states to alternative, open theoretical frameworks or explanations. Unlike inductivists and deductivists believe, this procedure from the unknown to the known is rational, and therefore something that can be systematized and learned. There is a logic of discovery, and what could be a better place to apply and develop it than futures research. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As a foresight concept, ""wild cards"" refer to trend-breaking/trend-creating events that are very hard or even impossible to anticipate, but that should nonetheless be expected in complex and fast-evolving environments. The discussion is grounded in the experience obtained in two strategic foresight projects carried out in two industries - civil aviation and investment banking. The unique strength of these cases is that they constitute concrete and rare examples of disclosed business foresight studies that, from the start, included an explicit wild card element. Most interestingly, both of these cases are analytically linked to the September 11 event, a severe instance of a wild card. A key rationale for wild card-friendly foresight research is that it is a source of critical inputs for the generation of robust decisions precisely when the organisation is under pressure from unexpected dramatic strategic discontinuities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A plethora of host defensive systems have evolved to counteract and/or eliminate invading pathogens. These strategies exert selection pressure upon the pathogen, leading to the emergence of mechanisms to combat the host including immune evasion and resistance. Consequently, effective control of rapidly evolving diseases is contingent on the ability to predict pathogen evolution prior to the emergence of resistant phenotypes. Highlighted in this article is a bacteriophage-based technology capable of screening hundreds of millions of binding events simultaneously at single molecule resolution, thus providing an in vitro mimetic of protein evolution. This technology, termed phage escape, can be utilized to model the evolution of proteins in the presence of antibodies or other selective pressure, providing a predictive solution to the coevolution of antigens and the immune system. Foresight into the evolutionary path of an antigen and subsequent neutralization strategies can facilitate more efficacious vaccination formulation and have important implications in the treatment of a range of evolving diseases, including viral infections and cancer. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"antibody; hemagglutinin; peptide library; protein; article; bacteriophage; biological model; cell free system; chemistry; directed molecular evolution; human; immune system; influenza; metabolism; methodology; molecular evolution; mutagenesis; phenotype; Antibodies; Bacteriophages; Cell-Free System; Directed Molecular Evolution; Evolution, Molecular; Hemagglutinins; Humans; Immune System; Influenza, Human; Models, Biological; Mutagenesis; Peptide Library; Phenotype; Proteins",,"hemagglutinin, 37333-12-3; protein, 67254-75-5; Antibodies; Hemagglutinins; Peptide Library; Proteins",,,"Burton, D.R., Stanfield, R.L., Wilson, I.A., (2005) Proc.

Intelligence organisations or communities are also increasingly expected to achieve some sort of comprehension of a general situation and the course of specific events. In the best of worlds, this comprehension can be transformed into useful background analysis or warning – whether early or late, specific or general – that something is or might be developing in the domain that the intelligence service is expected to monitor. In the real world, lack of comprehension and, thus, of foresight is a common phenomenon, so common that it now constitutes the dominating theme of intelligence studies. Remove the failures and little is left of what is written about intelligence analysis and its use during the Cold War and beyond. Huge efforts have thus been expended to investigate and ponder why intelligence has been unable to deliver what was rightfully or wrongfully expected from it and to find solutions in terms of intelligence reform, often focused on reorganisation. This failure–investigation–reorganisation cycle has become something of a malaise of early 21st-century Western intelligence. A consensus has emerged on the necessity to transform intelligence and improve its ability to analyse and deliver foresight. However, neither reorganisation nor analytic training is a sufficient answer. The fundamental problem is the implicit model for knowledge production in intelligence systems that have been in place for more than a half-century. © Swedish National Defence College 2009.",,,,,,,"Herman, M., (1996) Intelligence Power in Peace and War, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Treverton, G.F., (2001) Reshaping National Intelligence in the Age of Information, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Manoeuvre, S., (1978) Sovjetiska Östersjömarinen – Landstigning sövning; Kuhn, T.S., (1962) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970, and 1996; Sharrock, W., Read, R., (2002) Kuhn: Philosopher of Scientific Revolution, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Kuhn, T., (2002) A Philosophical History for Our Time, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Heuer, R.J., (1999) Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, , Washington: Center for the Study of Intelligence; Johnston, R., (2005) Analyticculture in the U.S. Intelligence Community: An Ethnographic Study, , Washington: Center for the Study of Intelligence; Wohlstetter, R., (1962) Pearl Harbor:Warning and Decision, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Kam, W.E., (1988) Surprise Attack: The Victim’s Perspective, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Betts, R., (1982) Surprise Attack: Lessons for the Defense Planning, , Washington: Brookings Institute; Bar-Joseph, U., (2005) The Watchman Fell Asleep: The Surprise of Yom Kippur and Its Sources, , New York: State University of New York Press; Herzog, C., (1975) The War of Atonement, , London: Weidenfelt and Nicolson; Kahana, E., Early warning versus concept: The case of the yom kippurwar (2002) Intelligence and National Security, 17 (2). , Summer; Kumaraswamy, P.R., Revisiting the Yom Kippur War, , London: Frank Cass, 2000; Shazli, S.E., (2003) The Crossing of the Suez, , San Francisco: American Mideast Research; Blight And David, J.G., (1998) Welch, Intelligence and the Cubanmissile Crisis, , London: Frank Cass; Wiebes, C., (2003) Intelligence and the War in Bosnia, , M¨unchen: LIT Verlag; London (2006) May, , “Report into the London Terrorist Attacks on 7 July 2005” (Intelligence and Security Committee; Barger, D.G., Towards a Revolution in Intelligence Affairs, p. 2005. , Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation; Hart, D., Simon, S., Thinking straight and talking straight: Problems of intelligence analysis (2006) Survival, 48 (1). , Spring; Moore, D.T., (2006) Critical Thinking and Intelligence Analysis, , Washington: Joint Military Intelligence College, Occasional Paper 14, May",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781139174541; 9780521518574,,,"English","National Intelligence Systems: Current Research and Future Prospects",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919541003

During these past years, we have been witnessing a number of mobile payment trials based on NFC. Early experiences are already quite encouraging and many expect NFC to become a highly efficient and effective technology for mobile payments. The objective of our research is to evaluate in a systematic manner the potential of NFC as an upcoming technology for mobile payments. In order to ensure the rigor of our research, we used a formal and structured approach based on multi-actor multi-criteria methods. Our research provides one of the first assessment of NFC and a realistic picture of the current Swiss situation as we involved numerous mobile payment experts. Our findings show that Swiss industry experts are quite enthusiastic about the future of NFC. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Market analysis; Mobile payments; NFC; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Balaban, D., Japan's mobile wallets fail to inspire - Yet, card technology (2007), (13-04-2007); Benayoun, R., Roy, B., Sussmann, B., (1966) Manuel De Réference Du Programme Electre, , Note de synthese, formation n.25.

The units of analysis to be used are the educational laws and bills designed by the current national government. A comparative and historical analysis is made of the approved '90s legislation, which led to a structural reform of the educational system. A description is given of the changes then applied to both its academic structure and the institutional organization of the system. In principle, the current reform consists of two national laws, authorised in 2005, which regulate partially educational issues and a new national law for education, which was introduced and passed by the Parliament at the end of 2006. The legislation from the '90s is countermanded by this new 2006 education law, which establishes a new academic structure. The implementation of such a structure could be challenging given that, in that respect, the starting point is also difficult due to the inequality and discrimination in the national education system. It is necessary to learn from the 1993 Federal Law on Education. If we do not take notice of the conditions in which Argentinean education occurs, as a consequence of the implementation of the afore-mentioned law, the achievement of the objectives set by this bill is highly unlikely. We can see the emergence once again of the absolute lack of foresight of the potential consequences of further alterations in the academic educational structure, in the scope of government authorities holding concurrent competences whilst trying to implement the new structure differently. It constitutes a serious problem, the consequences of which seem not to be sufficiently considered.","Academic structure; Educational laws; Educational policy; Educational reform; Educational system",,,,,,,"Ruiz, G.; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Universidad de Buenos AiresArgentina; email: gruiz@psi.uba.ar",,,,,,,,00348082,,,,"Spanish","Revista Educ.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349497317
