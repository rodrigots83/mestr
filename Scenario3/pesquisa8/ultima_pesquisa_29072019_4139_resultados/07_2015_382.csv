Examples are identifying types of operations with the lowest impact under varying conditions, purposeful planning procedures as well as follow-up and training programs for machine operators and contractors. Finland and Sweden are now developing supply systems for fractions that have previously been left in the forest after logging; small trees, logging residues and stumps. The chapter discusses raw materials used in forest energy production in Finland and Sweden, and forest energy supply chains in Finland and Sweden. The mobilization of additional forest biomass resources calls for new technological solutions. Foresight studies show that in the developed biomass markets such as Finland and Sweden and partially Central Europe, the growth of biomass demand will be from the large combined heat and power (CHP) plants and from possibly emerging large biorefineries. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The chronological changes were revealed by extracting frequent appeared words and by their correspondence analysis. We could find the past emerging attentions and their turning points in Japan from the descriptions in which the experts tried to depict new elements in science and technology and future society. The main consciousness of experts had progressed in an incremental course during 1970s-2000. It turned around to another direction in 2000s, where they have respected the relationship with society more. A representative word that the attention has become less because of its progress was computer. Recent attentions for information energy and environment and the strength in their relationship with society issues suggest that they are current emerging fields where more innovative concepts are needed. © 2013 IEEE.","attention; correspondence; Foresight; text-mining","Data mining; Industrial management; Surveys; attention; correspondence; Correspondence analysis; Energy and environment; Foresight; Science and Technology; Text mining; Turning points; Engineering research",,,,,"Yokoo, Y., Okuwada, K., Validity of foresight derived from the evaluation of past activities in Japan (2012) Int.

Box 800, Groningen, 9700 AV, Netherlands","The goal of this introductory article to the Special Issue on Corporate Foresight is to provide an overview of the state of the art, major challenges and to identify development trajectories. We define corporate foresight as a practice that permits an organization to lay the foundation for a future competitive advantage. Historically we distinguish and discuss four main phases: 1) birth of the field (1950s), 2) the age of scenarios (1960s-1970s), 3) professionalization (1980s-1990s), and 4) organizational integration (2000-). A systematic literature search revealed 102 articles on foresight, 29 of them on corporate foresight. Based on these articles and those in this Special Issue, we identify four main themes. Two more mature themes, namely 'organizing corporate foresight', and 'individual and collective cognition', and two emerging themes 'corporate foresight in networked organizations', and 'quantifying value contributions'. In the conclusion we make a plea for establishing corporate foresight as a separate research stream that can adopt various theoretical foundations from a number of general management research traditions. To help the field move forward we identify three areas in which corporate foresight research can build on theoretical notions in general management, and can contribute to such on-going debates. © 2015.","Corporate foresight; Historical development; Review; Strategic foresight","Innovation; Reviews; Technological forecasting; Collective cognition; Competitive advantage; Corporate foresight; General management; Historical development; Networked organizations; Strategic foresight; Theoretical foundations; Competition; corporate strategy; economic history; historical perspective; industrial development; literature review",,,,,"Ahuja, G., Coff, R.W., Lee, P.M., Managerial foresight and attempted rent appropriation: insider trading on knowledge of imminent breakthroughs (2005) Strateg.

Foresight is believed to be having a positive impact on triggering organisational ambidexterity, especially explorative (radical) innovation. Very little empirical research has been done so far to test the probability of this theory with higher constraint designs. This paper reports on the results of a survey involving 230 manufacturing companies in Lithuania. It confirms the importance of organisational foresight, recognising its contribution to both explorative and exploitative innovations, i.e. organisational ambidexterity. Based on a conceptual model that describes organisational foresight as a set of environmental scanning, strategic selection and integrating capabilities, this paper proposes testable measures of organisational foresight. We empirically test the model and provide evidence to the theoretical relationship between organisational foresight and organisational ambidexterity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Capabilities; Exploitation; Exploration; Organisational ambidexterity; Organisational foresight","Natural resources exploration; Technological forecasting; Capabilities; Conceptual model; Empirical research; Environmental scanning; Exploitation; Focal points; Manufacturing companies; Organisational; Innovation",,,,,"Duncan, R.B., The ambidextrous organisation: designing dual structures for innovation (1976) Strategies and Implementation, 1, pp. 167-188. , North-Holland, New York, R.H.

Strategic management, specifically the dynamic capabilities approach and vast literature on corporate and strategic foresight argue that deficiencies like one-dimensionality, narrow-sightedness and myopia of closed corporate processes are remedied by incorporating external sources. A broad knowledge base promises to especially benefit foresight in multiple ways. Thus, created an analytical framework that integrates the dynamic capabilities approach with existing results on potential value contributions of foresight, enriched with existing findings in networked foresight and organizational design in the light increasing importance of inter-organizational networks. We conducted a series of interviews and a survey among foresight practitioners in a network to explore the perceived value proposition of networked foresight for the network partners and the network itself. The analysis is based on data drawn from the EIT ICT Labs network of large industry corporations, small-and-medium sized companies, and academic and research institutes. Our study shows that network partners use the results primarily for sensing activities, i.e. data collection and to a lesser extend activity initiation. More sensitive and fundamental organizational aspects such as strategy and decision-making or path-dependency are less affected. Especially SMEs may benefit substantially from network approaches to foresight whereas MNEs are more confident in their existing corporate foresight processes and results. The value for the network itself is substantial and goes beyond value creation potential for companies as discussed in literature. The development of a shared vision-relatable to organizational learning and reconfiguration capabilities-was identified as particularly valuable for the network. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Collaboration for innovation; Corporate foresight; Dynamic capabilities; Innovation networks; Networked foresight; Open innovation","Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Corporate foresight; Dynamic capabilities; Innovation network; Networked foresight; Open innovation; Enterprise resource management",,,,,"Teece, D.J., Pisano, G., Shuen, A., Dynamic capabilities and strategic management (1997) Strateg.

In this regard, identification of strong and weak aspects of Foresight design and implementation, a quality of outputs and a degree of impact as well as learning from this practice is of great importance. Strong evaluation procedures contribute to further Foresight development and its effectiveness.Literature analysis reveals the diversity of different approaches and criteria for Foresight evaluation at the national level however its basic principles are not yet consolidated and spread for use. The purpose of this paper is to start such consolidation through the development of an integrated approach for ex-post national Foresight evaluation. The proposed methodology was tested in the Russian National Foresight 2030 and the article presents and analyzes the results.

It describes how the early detection of medium- to long-term developments in the broader business environment, including social and market developments, is integrated into innovation and strategy processes. The purpose of this paper is to give an account of foresight practice in an automotive company that (1) covers the full range of roles and practices of a mature foresight group, (2) describes case examples how such roles and practices are played out in practice and (3) concludes with general recommendations for organizational design and processes. The paper highlights five major fields of foresight practice which encompass strategic issues in different working fields: early detection in new business environments, trend research for the generation of product innovations, prospective evaluation of innovation ideas, exploration and development of new business, and cross-functional dissemination of future-related issues. Practice examples in each field detail features of the integration of foresight in corporate processes. The paper finishes with characterizing the organizational architecture of a mature corporate foresight group, a discussion and overall conclusions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Automotive business; Business environment; Corporate foresight; Future research; Innovation management; Strategic planning","Innovation; Management science; Strategic planning; Automotive business; Business environments; Corporate foresight; Exploration and development; Innovation management; Organizational architecture; Organizational designs; Prospective evaluation; Automotive industry; automobile industry; corporate strategy; future prospect; innovation; multinational enterprise; research; strategic approach",,,,,"Baron, W., Häußler, S., Luther, W., Zweck, A., Innovations- und Technikanalyse (2003) Chancen und Barrieren betrieblicher Integration, , Campus Verlag, Frankfurt/New York; Becker, P., (2002) Corporate Foresight in Europe: A First Overview.

We seek to deepen this understanding by applying a cognitive lens. We mainly explore how and why foresight can influence ways of processing information, first conceptually and then empirically through the case of the Cisco Technology Radar. Through consulting multiple individuals, opposed to focusing solely on statements from top managers or observable outputs on the firm level, we uncover a broad set of ""hidden values"" from this technology foresight initiative. We conclude that a critical mechanism of a system such as the radar is its probing of analytical thinking, as well as its way of making people connect and exchange views across functions and departments. We also observe that deeper and more frequent involvement corresponds with greater perceived value of the system. Our findings have implications for research seeking to further understand through which mechanisms foresight creates value, and for the practice of designing, implementing and motivating for participation in technology foresight. © 2014 The Authors.","Cognition; Decision-making; Dual process theory; Mental models; Organizational future orientation; Technology foresight; Technology radar","Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision theory; Cognition; Dual-process theories; Mental model; Organizational future orientations; Technology foresight; Technology radar; Radar; decision making; design; information processing; information technology; radar; Coregonus artedi",,,,,"Allard-Poesi, F., Representations and influence processes in groups: towards a socio-cognitive perspective on cognition in organization (1998) Scand.

The paper proposes an organizational futurist role as an internal champion and broker to facilitate the integration process. It builds on the direct experience of one of the authors in crafting the role by revisiting and critically reviewing the papers reporting on findings from that experience. A literature review is then used to reflect on the gaps identified and to stimulate new conceptualizations in order to ground the role in a more suitable academic approach. The paper proposes several tangible approaches for how an organizational futurist role might respond to three principal challenges to the integration of foresight identified and confirmed by a review of the literature. The paper concludes with a research agenda to explore those approaches. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate foresight; Foresight; Integration; Organizational futurist","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Corporate foresight; Direct experience; Foresight; Integration process; Literature reviews; Organizational futurist; Research agenda; Integration",,,,,"Slaughter, R., The state of play in the futures field: a metascanning overview (2009) Foresight, 11 (5), p. 17; Rohrbeck, R., Gemünden, H., Corporate foresight: its three roles in enhancing the innovation capacity of a firm (2011) Technol.

More generally, we investigate the value that firms, facing growing uncertainty because of the fast pace of external changes, create through foresight. We base our analysis on three different research streams: the first one is literature on environmental uncertainty; the second one is literature on strategic planning and first mover (dis)advantages; and the third one is literature on organizational learning and organizational memories. We thus focus on two fundamental questions which characterize the interaction between turbulent environments, foresight and long-term performances: what kind of knowledge should organizations achieve in order to sustain their competitive edge?

With increasing unpredictability, under pressure of time and in multi-agency situations, however, traditional foresight and strategic management fail. In this paper, we redefine a foresight process for real time network management instructed by the extreme case of collaboration in global disaster management. We use an actor-network approach to explore on global and local levels emerging networks. We find that ad hoc and long term network dynamics are governance structures for unpredictable collaboration just as traditional goal setting and targeting is conducive to stable environments. Altogether five dynamic network patterns are found that underlie successful ad hoc collaboration: (1) identification of heterogeneous network actors and early alignment of interests (2) development of a shared vision for heterogeneous goals (3) use of boundary objects (4) punctual directness and distance among implementing actors (5) intense local integration of the focal actor. Governmental decision makers, corporate actors and voluntary associations who are cognisant of dynamic network patterns can use them for rapid collaboration instead of long-range foresight and constituent planning. To base leadership on dynamic network principles instead of traditional strategic management means to adopt a new real-time foresight for collaborative innovation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Collaborative innovation; Dynamic network principles; Real time foresight; Sustainable global relief","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Heterogeneous networks; Network management; Planning; Strategic planning; Ad-hoc collaboration; Collaborative innovation; Dynamic network; Global reliefs; Governance structures; Real time; Strategic management; Voluntary associations; Decision making; decision making; disaster management; dynamic analysis; innovation; real time; strategic approach",,,,,"Akrich, M., Callon, M., Latour, B., The key to success in innovation part I: the art of interessement (2002) Int.

This research advances knowledge on the practice of foresight in long-term planning through a comparative analysis of planning approaches in two organisations linked through common ownership. Data generated from planning documentation and the foresight practice of strategy personnel in the two cases (transport and banking) provided support for a dynamic model of foresight integrated LT planning. The ongoing collection and synthesis of strong and weak signals, and their continual assimilation into scenarios depicting alternative futures was structurally supported by a community-of-practice. The community-of-practice widely engaged strategists located across organisational levels in conversations about emerging futures and about strategies through which to engage those futures. The findings encourage managers and researchers to view long-term planning as an ongoing interrogation of implemented and envisioned strategies within emerging, alternative futures. Such an approach stimulates strategic entrepreneurship and prepares the organisation for engaging in future environments. © 2013.","Community-of-practice; Foresight; Long-term planning","Technological forecasting; Community of practice; Comparative analysis; Foresight; Long term planning; Organisational level; Research advances; Strategic capability; Weak signals; Innovation",,,,,"Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, 1. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; Ofek, E., Wathieu, L., Are you ignoring trends that could shape up your business?

The authors choose Russia as an illustrative case of an economy in the changing geopolitical context to review major trends of global value chains’ development, specific features of Russia’s participation in them, and the necessary steps to increase the quality and efficiency of this participation. Special attention was paid to theoretical, methodological, and empirical tools of GVC research and of making relevant political decisions—which presently are far from being adequate: they need to be supplemented with the new ones to improve the forecasting potential and practical and strategic orientation of the GVC approach. To this end, approaches which would make it possible to research interconnection between global processes and trends with regional and national innovation-based development tendencies become of crucial importance. Application of foresight methodology may significantly contribute to researching the GVC phenomenon, being a major logical step towards creating advanced policy tools to mobilise available resources and coordinate stakeholders’ actions to increase Russia’s global competitiveness. The paper presents a number of case studies which describe practical application of various foresight methodology components to analyse Russian participation in various GVCs, by the examples of specific product and service groups (fresh fruit and vegetables, car parts, mobile phones, air transport, electronic payment systems). The authors conclude that both full-scale foresight studies and specific components thereof could be applied for the purposes of GVC analysis, strategic planning, and making political decisions. © 2016, Meshkova and Moiseichev.","Competition; Foresight; Global value-added chains (GVCs); Globalisation; Innovation; Trade",,,,,,"Backer, D.K., Miroudot, S., (2014) Mapping Global Value Chains (SSRN Scholarly Paper No. ID 2436411), , Social Science Research Network, Rochester; Chulok, A., (2014) «Before climbing a ladder, check whether you are climbing the right one», , [WWW Document].

A variety of foresight tools are in place to support top management's strategic decision-making. However, leaders cannot claim to have the full scope of knowledge and capabilities required for creating a long-term, robust and implementable strategy. Today, many experts with the relevant detailed knowledge about future developments and organisational capabilities can be found in middle management, which needs to be reflected in an integrative approach towards strategy development.In this paper, an approach is presented that describes how a foresight-based strategy development approach can be designed in order to leverage the potential of middle management. This approach is applied in strategy development to the supply chain management of a multinational manufacturing company. The case focuses on Asia, and includes 37 middle managers plus their staff - totalling approximately 70 employees - from 13 countries. The results indicate that top and middle management were willing to follow the highly structured process, contributing to strategy development in terms of ideas, data, time, resources and analytical work. The developed strategy integrated the middle management's perspective successfully and strategy implementation started immediately. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate foresight; Middle management; Scenarios; Strategy development; Strategy-as-practice","Human resource management; Information management; Knowledge management; Planning; Supply chain management; Corporate foresight; Middle management; Scenarios; Strategy as practices; Strategy development; Decision making",,,,,"Hutzschenreuther, T., Kleindienst, I., Strategy-process research: what have we learned and what is still to be explored (2006) J.

A framework is proposed for thematic priority setting through the application of Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA) and for achieving clear policy impacts by including principles for impact optimisation. A combination of foresight methodologies such as expert workshops, a Delphi survey, roadmapping elements, and prioritisation techniques was applied to select relevant topics for a joint research call. The paper shows how foresight can be embedded in a multilateral S&T programme cooperation using a set of coordination dimensions and design principles. Strategies for achieving policy impact and for communicating foresight results are also outlined. Future research is proposed to further improve guidance to facilitate more global research programme cooperation in the future to jointly address global challenges. © 2015.","Foresight; FTA; Multilateral research cooperation; Priority setting","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Foresight; FTA; Global challenges; Priority setting; Research cooperation; Research programmes; Stakeholder groups; Technology analysis; Air navigation; future prospect; international cooperation; policy analysis; research; stakeholder; Europe; Russian Federation",,,,,"Boden, M., Cagnin, C., Carabias, V., Haegeman, K., Könnölä, T., (2010) Facing the Future: Time for the EU to Meet Global Challenges, EUR 24364 EN, , European Commission; Boden, M., Johnston, R., Scapolo, F., The role of FTA in responding to grand challenges: a new approach for STI policy?

In order to understand what is meant by roadmaps - and not to confuse roadmaps with foresight in general - a comparative analysis was jointly performed by the Beijing Research Centre for Science of Science (BRCSS) under the Beijing Academy of Science and Technology and the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (ISI). This joint project investigated several cases according to a set of criteria and compared the content. The aim of the project was mutual learning and the results revealed that the differences can be found on different levels like the understanding of the terminology (not only language), cultural understandings, the background of the innovation system and contexts of the roadmaps and the understanding of the objectives. The way the process is performed differed significantly whereas the differences in the processes themselves, the number of participants or the topic fields were rather similar. In the paper, some of the differences are discussed in context and lessons learned are explained. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Comparison China and Germany; Foresight; Foresight method; Foresight objectives; Innovation system; Roadmapping","Technological forecasting; Comparison China and Germany; Foresight; Foresight method; Foresight objectives; Innovation system; Roadmapping; Innovation; comparative study; innovation; mapping; China; Germany",,,,,"(2012) Technology Roadmap of Beijing's Gas System Security, Beijing, , Beijing Research Center for Science of Science (Ed.); Chinese Academy of Sciences (2010) Technological Revolution and China's Future Innovations by 2050, Beijing, , CAS (Ed.); (2008) National LED Industry Technology Roadmap, Beijing, , Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development (Ed.); Coates, J.F., Foresight in federal government policymaking (1985) Futur.

By synchronising long-term research trajectories with public preferences, we can ensure the viability of scientific and technological advances. This synchronisation requires a systematic method that can enable people both to think in terms of societal and technological co-evolution and to anticipate their future needs and wants. To this end, Shaping Future has developed an original participatory foresight methodology that is centred on design know-how and promotes innovative forms of preference articulation.This paper presents the approaches and findings that guided the project and its results, including the developed methodology.

Hyperopia is a metaphorical term adopted from ocular science referring to long-sightedness-a condition of being able to focus clearly on that which is far away but not that which is nearby. Managerial hyperopia describes a managerial approach that focuses with acuity on that which is far off (temporally, spatially or cognitively) whilst failing to interpret and manage that which is close at hand. Hyperopia is pathology of a managerial approach that habitually favours the long term to the extent that the short-term is marginalised. Hyperopia is thus distinct from far-sightedness, or foresight, which is an understanding of that which is to come about. As a response to environmental flux, the emergence of managerial hyperopia contradicts existing theory which predicts short-sighted managerial responses. Based on longitudinal empirical evidence from a single qualitative case study we argue that managerial hyperopia can emerge from an over-emphasis on foresight activities in a top management team in a period of time considered as turbulent. Further, we suggest that without counterbalancing operational attention, goal-oriented foresight activities may compound this and unintentionally lead to detrimental organizational performance in the here and now. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Foresightful learning; Hyperopia; Myopia; Scenario planning; Unintended consequences","Managers; Foresightful learning; Hyperopia; Myopia; Scenario Planning; Unintended consequences; Human resource management",,,,,"de Geus, A.P., Planning as learning (1988) Harv.

In Russia 'Rapid Foresight' technique was worked out by Agency of Strategic Initiative and now it is quite actively used. Several Profession Atlas versions showing expert opinions of professional societies about the changes which may appear in the structure and quality of personnel in different spheres in remote future were developed with the helpof Rapid Foresight Technology usage. With the help of 'Rapid Foresight' technique perspectives for education and service sphere professions and personnel competencies were developed. On the base of the present technique the authors of the article have carried out an investigation on robotization trend in service and tourism spheres. The investigation showed that the opinions of employers and educational institutes' representatives are splitted into two equal parts: one half thinks that in service robotization will prevail and the other half says that the human factor will predominate. Hence, the results of New York Federal Reserve Bank investigation, which forecasted the growth of non-routine labor and connected with that crucial necessity for such catering, service, hospitality and tourism personnel competencies as thought flexibility, ability to settle non-typical problems and use of creative approach in servicing clients. The materials of the article have a practical value for educational institutes, engaged in training of Service and Tourism personnel, and for Service and Tourism enterprises themselves. © 2015 by ASERS Publishing.","Competence; Development forecast; Education; Foresight; Personnel; Service; Tourism",,,,,,"Becker, B.E., (2001) The HR Scorecard: Linking People, Strategy, and Performance Boston, Mass, , Harvard, Business School Press cop; Buckingham, M., (2008) Leader Strength.

The main objective is not to determine where to invest but how to help agents to discover where to invest in a decentralised and bottom-up logic. The methodology accepted in Lithuania departs from the traditional approach to priority setting focused on identification of research fields or economy sectors, and builds on the concepts of long term challenges and critical technologies. Choosing challenge-based priorities allows to better develop synergies and integrated policies, thus reducing fragmentation. A mixed qualitative and quantitative method approach is applied, including the expert panels, surveys, statistical and bibliometrical analysis, roadmaps, and analytical studies on the emerging trends and long term challenges. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Entrepreneurial discovery; Foresight; Long term challenges; Research and innovation priorities; Smart specialisation","Technological forecasting; Critical technologies; Entrepreneurial discovery; Foresight; Long term challenges; Methodological approach; Specialisation; Strategy development; Traditional approaches; Innovation; development strategy; entrepreneur; future prospect; innovation; planning method; specialization; strategic approach; Lithuania",,,,,"Asheim, B., Boschma, R.A., Cooke, P., Constructing regional advantage: platform policies based on related variety and differentiated knowledge bases (2011) Reg.

However, relatively little attention has been devoted to what and how individuals - such as managers and strategists - learn from participation within strategic scenario processes. The paper focuses on the learning effects of scenario processes on participants, using the Futures Literacy Hybrid Strategic Scenario (FL HSS) method. It presents an evaluative framework for capturing the learning and cognitive effects of using the imaginary future, and the learning benefits derived by participants in intensive scenario processes. The paper outlines how scenario activities change the capabilities of the individuals and organizational systems to understand the nature and role of the future for what they perceive and what they do. Cognition is the domain of the individual rather than the organization and, as a result, the micro processes through which individuals learn and challenge mental models appear to be antecedent resources to collective mental model changes within organizations. This suggests that companies should invest in pedagogically rich scenario processes that develop the capability of managers to sense changes. The learning generated by scenario processes can strengthen the 'sensing' dynamic capabilities of firms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Learning; Scenarios; Strategic foresight","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Dynamic capabilities; Learning; Learning and cognitive; Learning effects; Organizational learning; Organizational system; Scenarios; Strategic foresight; Managers; cognition; corporate strategy; learning; organizational framework",,,,,"Aaltonen, M., (2007) The third lens.

A variety of methods have been developed to support and improve the technological scanning process but the success of corporate foresight activities depends initially and heavily on the quality of information processing at the 'front end of innovation'. Since this information activity involves individual members of the organization it is important to examine the general cognitive and intuitive abilities of these individuals. In order to enrich existing knowledge in this context, this paper explores the technology identification and evaluation process from a psychological standpoint, looking in particular at the concept of cognitive prototypes and intuition of technological gatekeepers. The findings of this study show that technological gatekeepers possess specific cognitive prototype models and thinking patterns, which exert an influence on identification and evaluation of technologies and that the number of features a thinking pattern contains is correlated with the number of years spent in a position in the organization as technological gatekeeper. Our exploration of the role of intuition also highlighted a discrepancy between the individual and the organization. While it is perceived on an individual level as a valuable tool, it is seen by technological gatekeepers as inappropriate on an organizational level. As a result, gut feeling is not always acknowledged or communicated within the organization in the technology identification and evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive prototype; Corporate foresight; Gut feeling; Technological gatekeeper; Technology evaluation; Technology identification","Technological forecasting; Cognitive prototype; Corporate foresight; Gut feeling; Technological gatekeepers; Technology evaluation; Technology identification; Innovation; Pyronia tithonus",,,,,"Costanzo, L.A., Strategic foresight in a high-speed environment (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 219-235; Postma, T.J.B.M., Alers, J.C., Terpstra, S., Zuurbier, A., Medical technology decisions in The Netherlands: how to solve the dilemma of technology foresight versus market research?

As Coase (J Law Econ 15:143–149, 1972) makes clear, the foresight of consumers may restrain the power of monopolists and oligopolists, especially when the goods are durable and the firms lack the ability to commit to future prices and/or outputs. This important insight clearly has significant implications for antitrust policies. However, the extent to which the powers of firms are curtailed depends on a host of factors which are explored in a number of important contributions. These factors include the length of time between two consecutive offers, the rate of depreciation of the durable goods, the product lines offered by firms producing the durable goods, the nature of network externalities in the primary market and the aftermarkets, the ability of firms to rely on reputational effects, and so on. This paper also reviews issues that are closely related to product durability, such as consumption capital in the case addictive goods, anticipation of future network congestions, and sales of assets such as shares of a firm’s subsidiaries, or shares of a majority shareholder who has an influence on managers. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Aftermarkets;

This change implies a need to look for new more flexible, creative and participatory ways to approach future research.The concept of social innovation becomes highly relevant in this context, since it means understanding innovation as a culture: an essential part of the value code and the collective identity of a society and/or human organization. This concept implies a holistic, creative and democratic way to approach innovation, traditionally associated with science and technology and future thinking.5. FLUX-3D is a tool designed to assess innovative proposals (ideas, products, processes or services) according to users' experience. Thanks to its simplicity, together with the fact that it is systematic and based on tridimensional cube-shaped graphic representations, FLUX-3D provides key information about users' satisfaction - with regard to their expectations - immediately and at first sight, on three different levels of analysis (dimensions, indicators, variables), and in a very accessible as well as intuitive way. It can additionally provide real time feedback which is helpful both for short-, medium- and long-term decision-making because of its participatory and open nature. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Change management; Design thinking; Innovation culture; Participatory foresight; Users' experience","Decision making; Change management; Design thinking; Innovation Culture; Participatory foresight; Users' experiences; Innovation; design; innovation; media role; participatory approach; social network; technological change; three-dimensional modeling",,,,,"Dictionary of the Spanish Language (2001) Diccionario de la lengua española, , (Madrid); Bas, E., (1999) Prospectiva; herramientas para la gestión estratégica del cambio, , Ariel, Barcelona; Bas, E., Creative futures (2012) The role of youth in a brand new world, to be young!, , Finland Futures Research Center, Turku, Finland; Masini, E., (1993) Why Futures Studies?, , Grey Seal, London; (2007) Thinking About the Future; Guidelines for Strategic Foresight, , Social Technologies, Houston, P.

In spite of our best efforts, there still exist species differences that prevent the application directly from animal to human, and in some examples having a completely different and adverse effect from that seen in the animal model. There are several ways in which we can improve the opportunity for a positive test outcome and at the same time reduce the animal usage which is associated with our current animal testing practices.

Hülsmann (1998) raises this critique and puts forward a general theory of error cycles centered on government intervention in the economy in order to overcome the perceived shortcomings of the traditional ABCT. The paper analyzes the main implications of this critique of the ABCT in terms of entrepreneurial foresight and the optimal course of action necessary to prevent a monetary induced business cycle, in particular in the context of fractional reserve banks operating under fiat currency. It concludes that within the general framework of human action, entre­preneurs cannot arbitrage away clusters of errors, and the ABCT remains valid. This paper also questions whether Hülsmann’s essentialist approach can be a viable alternative to the traditional ABCT, and find that, despite its merits, the approach can be refuted as a stand-alone theory. © 2015, Ludwig Von Mises Institute.

Civil security technologies and their implementation are generally characterized by high complexity, multi-stakeholder involvement and a high level of regulation. Due to these characteristics and the influence of societal aspects, it is extremely difficult to evaluate the future developments and applications of emerging security technologies. This is why only a small number of studies have addressed this issue so far and empirical insights into these aspects are still scarce. Our paper addresses this research gap by applying scenarios to consider different societal aspects and their impacts on emerging security technologies and their applications. Based on quantitative and qualitative data and are used as the evaluation background for emerging security technologies. The results show that this approach is suitable to consider technological and non-technological drivers and barriers, and to derive measures and recommendations. The paper contributes to research on technology innovation systems from a challenge-oriented policy perspective and gives new impulses for future research, especially in the field of civil security. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Scenario technique; Security technology; Societal needs; Technology assessment","Commerce; Engineering research; Foresight; Scenario technique; Security technology; Societal needs; Technology assessments; Mobile security; innovation; policy implementation; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; security; technological development; Europe",,,,,"Bierwisch, A., Seitz, R., Grandt, S., The innovation system of security: a new quality in the relationship between political, economic and social actors (2012) Innovation System Revisited, pp. 129-152. , Experiences from 40years of Fraunhofer ISI research, Fraunhofer Verlag, Stuttgart, Fraunhofer ISI (Ed.); Bierwisch, A., Grandt, S., Kayser, V., Report on Development and Application of an Economic Model concerning High Risk/High Payoff: Socio-economic Model for the Assessment of Emerging Security Technologies (2013) Deliverable 6.2, ETCETERA Project-Evaluation of Critical and Emerging Technologies for the Elaboration of a Security Research Agenda, , http://www.etcetera-project.eu/deliverables/index.html, (October, accessed 17-03-2015); Bierwisch, A., Kayser, V., Grandt, S., Shala, E., Dönitz, E., (2015) Future Security Scenarios 2030-Assessment of Civil Emerging Security Technologies, , Fraunhofer ISI, Karlsruhe, (forthcoming); (2010) Zukunftsmarkt Zivile Sicherheit.

Wind energy production has become an interesting option for alpine regions. In addition to grid reliability, public acceptance is an important factor that currently limits wind energy's market penetration.An interdisciplinary research team explored, through socio-economic and technical approaches, the current and future acceptance of wind energy production in the Swiss energy region of Goms, an alpine valley at 1300. m above sea level. The focus of this paper is on research questions comprising future societal challenges for the local population. For this purpose, the focus-group discussion has proven to be a valuable participatory method.Concerning future development of wind energy in the Alps, regional value creation (including workplaces) and the placement of systems where man-made infrastructure is already present were the main visions mentioned by workshop participants.So far, wind energy as implemented in the valley of Goms has not been perceived as a topic of conflict by the local community. Crucial components towards local acceptance of wind turbines are questions of aesthetics, technical performance and economic feasibility. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Focus group; Future energy generation; Local acceptance; Participatory foresight; Societal challenges; Wind energy","Sea level; Wind turbines; Focus groups; Future energies; Local acceptance; Participatory foresight; Societal challenges; Wind power; alpine environment; alternative energy; power generation; public attitude; renewable resource; wind power; wind turbine; Switzerland",,,,,"Aitken, M., Wind power and community benefits: challenges and opportunities (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 6066-6075; Burim, M., (2013) Akzeptanz der Windenergie bei der Bevölkerung, Gewerbe und Verbänden in der Region Goms, pp. 6-34. , Bachelor Thesis (not published) at ZHAW School of Management and Law, Winterthur; Devine-Wright, P., Rethinking NIMBYism: the role of place attachment and place identity in explaining place-protective action (2009) J.

It shows that the use of guidance by EU agencies is widespread and significant, but not pervasive in that 14 of the EU's 33 agencies currently engage in guidance-making. Where guidance is produced, it varies significantly between and within agencies as regards volume and length. These documents are hard to find, they are called a miscellany of different things, and there seems to have sprung up, ad hoc, a hierarchy of guidance that is both interesting and lacking in clarity. The question as to whether such guidance binds those to whom it has been addressed has been fudged, with agencies and courts engaging in exercises of tautology and misdirection to avoid the appearance of anything that looks like binding norm-making by the EU's agencies. Consultation and participation in the making of guidance seems lackadaisical. This map suggests a level of differentiation that is so ill-Thought out, and so ad hoc, so lacking in foresight and oversight, as to be dysfunctional. At the same time, the lack of engagement by the EU courts with these norms suggests that the site of opportunity for a way forward in this area lies other than with the judiciary. © Centre for European Legal Studies, Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge.","Agencies; Guidance; Hybridity; New governance; Rulemaking; Soft law",,,,,,"Busuioc, M., (2013) European Agencies: Law and Practices of Accountability, p. 14. , Oxford University Press; Hatzopoulos, V., Hard to soft: Governance in the EU internal market (2012) Cambridge Yearbook of European Legal Studies, 15 (101), p. 127; Geradin, D., Petit, N., (2004) The Development of Agencies at EU and National Levels: Conceptual Analysis and Proposals for Reform, p. 4. , Jean Monnet Working Paper 01/04; http://europa.eu/about-eu/agencies/index_en.htm, last accessed 1 June 2015; Yataganas, X.A., (2001) Delegation of Regulatory Authority in the European Union: The Relevance of the American Model of Independent Agencies, , Jean Monnet Working Paper 03/01; Harlow, C., Rawlings, R., (2014) Process and Procedure in EU Administration, p. 244. , Hart Publishing; Griller, S., Orator, A., Everything under Control?

In the last decade the European legislature has specifically focused its attention on ensuring energy security in the European Union, probably thinking that the problem of European food security had already been solved. Having a secure supply of energy is crucial for the well-being of European citizens and the economy. Increasing energy production in the EU includes further deployment of renewable energies. In this context the appeal of Agro-Energy has increased: Agro-Energy is an alternative energy source which guarantees maximumenergy security while at the same time having a less disruptive environmental impact. Policies aimed at providing incentives for Agro-Energy crops combined with the lack of foresight of the European legislature in defining the contents of the medium-term CAP reformhave implied a considerable shrinking of other crops directly or indirectly used as food. Growing crops for bioenergy or biofuels is increasingly viewed as conflicting with food production. Balancing the needs of eco-compatible energetic production of agricultural origin with the need to safeguard the basic rights of food is indispensable. The new CAP tries to take that into account. Even if today the primary sector is also expected to diversify energy supply sources, it is necessary, however, to ensure that the increased attention given to Agro-Energy issues does not imply a decrease in attention to what is known as food security.",,,,,,,"Tamponi, M., Le attività agricole per la produzione di colture energetiche (2009) Politiche di forestazione ed emissioni climalteranti, p. 75. , Lorenza Paoloni (ed.), Roma: Tellus; Paoloni, L., L'attività agricola di produzione energetica (2011) Trattato di diritto agrario, 2, p. 239. , Luigi Costato, Alberto Germanò and Eva Rook Basile (eds.), Il diritto agroambientale, Torino: Giappichelli; Goldoni, M., Utilizzazione di terreni agricoli per la realizzazione di impiantienergetici: aspetti giuridici (2012) Agricolturae contemperamento delle esigenze energetiche ed alimentari, p. 31. , Mariarita D'Addezio (ed.), Milano: Giuffrè; D'Addezio, M., Agricoltura ed energie rinnovabili: alcune osservazioni del giurista (2014) Il divenire del diritto agrario italiano ed europeo tra sviluppitecnologici e sostenibilità, p. 280. , Giulio Sgarbanti, Paolo Borghi e Alberto Germanò (eds.), Milano: Giuffrè; Best, G., Agro-Energy: A New Function of Agriculture , p. 1. , Lamnet-News 3rd Issue - June 2003; Bolognini, S., Common organization of agricultural markets (2012) European Food Law, p. 265. , Luigi Costato and Ferdinando Albisinni (eds.), Padova: Cedam; Bolognini, S., La carenza idrica nella politica agricola comunitaria (2012) Rivista di diritto agrario, 1, p. 436. , (see, in particular, the note 70 at p. 438); D'Addezio, M., Sicurezza degli alimenti: obiettivi del mercato dell'Unione europea ed esigenze nazionali (2010) Rivista di diritto agrario, 1, p. 381. , note 3; Lattanzi, P., Politiche agricole, politiche energetiche e sicurezza alimentare: farina e benzina (2012) Agricoltura e contemperamento delle esigenze energetiche ed alimentari, p. 53. , Mariarita D'Addezio (ed.), Milano: Giuffrè; Strambi, G., Insicurezza alimentare e insicurezza energetica.

Guided airdrop systems typically employ onboard wind velocity estimation methods to predict the wind in real time as the systems descend, but these methods provide no foresight of the winds near the ground. Unexpected ground winds can result in large errors in landing location, and they can even lead to damage or complete loss of the cargo if the system impacts the ground while traveling downwind. This paper reports on a ground-based mechatronic system consisting of a cup and vane anemometer coupled to a guided airdrop system through a wireless transceiver. The guidance logic running on the airdrop system's onboard autopilot is modified to integrate the anemometer measurements at ground level near the intended landing zone with onboard wind estimates to provide an improved, real-time estimate of the wind profile. The concept was first developed in the framework of a rigorous simulation model and then validated in the flight test. Both simulation and subsequent flight tests with the prototype system demonstrate reductions in the landing position error by more than 30% as well as a complete elimination of potentially dangerous downwind landings. © 2015 IEEE.","Anemometer; autonomous; guided airdrop; landing accuracy; parafoil; payload; wind estimation; wind profile","Anemometers; Flight simulators; Landing; Parachutes; Radio transceivers; Atmospheric Winds; Landing locations; Mechatronic systems; Prototype system; Rigorous simulation; Vane anemometers; Wind measurement; Wireless transceiver; Real time systems",,,,,"Ducote, R., Speelman, R., US Air Force concepts for accurate delivery of equipment and supplies (1967) J.

Such a plant can take advantage of certain characteristics of different storage technologies, and the example considered in this paper is a liquid air energy storage (LAES) plant with some compressed air energy storage (CAES) capacity, taking advantage of the low storage cost for LAES and relatively high efficiency for CAES. An algorithm is presented which can be used to find the maximum possible profits that may be obtained from a hybrid plant through electricity price arbitrage, and it is shown that a hybrid compressed air-liquid air plant with 2.5:1 ratio of charge time to discharge time profiting purely through arbitrage gives higher profit per unit CapEx than the equivalent pure CAES and pure LAES plant if charge time is longer than 36. h. A realistic control strategy is also presented which can be used if the plant operator has a certain amount of knowledge of future electricity prices. It is shown that, for a given foresight period, the performance of this strategy increases with the plant's round-trip efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Compressed air energy storage; Cryogenic energy storage; Hybrid energy storage; Liquid air energy storage; Techno-economic analysis","Compressed air; Costs; Cryogenic energy storage; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Liquefied gases; Pressure vessels; Profitability; Compressed air energy storages (CAES); Control strategies; Electricity prices; Hybrid energy storage; Hybrid energy storage systems; Series-connected; Storage technology; Techno- economic analysis; Compressed air energy storage",,,,,"Taylor, P.G., Bolton, R., Stone, D., Upham, P., Developing pathways for energy storage in the UK using a coevolutionary framework (2013) Energy Policy, 63, pp. 230-243; Lund, H., Andersen, A.N., Østergaard, P.A., Mathiesen, B.V., Connolly, D., From electricity smart grids to smart energy systems-a market operation based approach and understanding (2012) Energy, 42 (1), pp. 96-102; Benitez, L.E., Benitez, P.C., Cornelis van Kooten, G., The economics of wind power with energy storage (2008) Energy Econ., 30, pp. 1973-1989; (2014) Technology Roadmap: Energy Storage, , OECD/IEA; Madlener, R., Latz, J., Economics of centralized and decentralized compressed air energy storage for enhanced grid operation of wind power (2013) Appl.

The scientific value of this study is in its contribution to the scarce literature on the future of pulp and paper industry competitiveness from the tightening environmental regulation perspective, highlighting the complementary role of law-abiding and voluntary regulations. Using a Delphi-foresight method, the study evaluates the effectiveness of environmental regulation by identifying its positive and negative aspects for the future success of the pulp and paper industry, and uses the reduction of sulfur emissions as an example. From a business perspective, the panelists saw tightening regulation as both a threat and an opportunity, and stressed the role of the policy implementation in achieving actual environmental improvement. The strict regulatory measures were generally perceived as environmentally advantageous and more effective in the long term, but a rather divided view was seen in the ability of the sulfur emissions directive to effectively govern environmental sustainability. In discussion, the role of more voluntary alternatives to implementing command-and-control type policy measures is emphasized in complementing government legislation, to gain market benefits from greening the entire pulp and paper supply chain. To conclude, the development of sustainable transportation strategies has the potential to contribute toward long-term competitiveness in the pulp and paper industry, especially if new strategic innovation-oriented cross-sector partnerships develop in the production and use of transportation biofuels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Delphi study; Environmental regulation; Pulp and paper industry; Sulfur directive; Sustainable transportation","Competition; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Laws and legislation; Paper; Pulp; Sulfur; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Transportation; DELPHI study; Environmental improvements; Environmental sustainability; Government legislations; Policy implementations; Pulp and paper industry; Strategic innovations; Sustainable transportation; Paper and pulp industry",,,,,"Abbott, K.W., Snidal, D., Hard and soft law in international governance (2000) Int.

New health technology, such as bedside ultrasonography, might successfully integrate the clinical approach optimizing the use of limited resources, especially in a person-oriented vision of medicine. Bedside ultrasonography is a safe and reliable technique, with worldwide expanding employment in various clinical settings, being considered as “the stethoscope of the 21st century”. However, at present, bedside ultrasonography lacks economic analysis. We performed a Cost–Benefit Analysis “ex ante”, with a break-even point computing, of bedside ultrasonography implementation in an Internal Medicine department in the mid-term. Number and kind estimation of bedside ultrasonographic studies were obtained by a retrospective study, whose data results were applied to the next 3-year period (foresight study). All 1980 foreseen bedside examinations, with prevailing multiorgan ultrasonographic studies, were considered to calculate direct and indirect costs, while specific and generic revenues were considered only after the first semester. Physician professional training, equipment purchase and working time represented the main fixed and variable cost items. DRG increase/appropriateness, hospitalization stay shortening and reduction of traditional ultrasonography examination requests mainly impacted on calculated revenues. The break-even point, i.e. the volume of activity at which revenues exactly equal total incurred costs, was calculated to be 734 US examinations, corresponding to € 81,998 and the time considered necessary to reach it resulting 406 days. Our economic analysis clearly shows that bedside ultrasonography implementation in clinical daily management of an Internal Medicine department can produce consistent savings, or economic profit according to managerial choices (i.e., considering public or private targets), other than evident medical benefits. © 2015, SIMI.","Bedside ultrasonography; Costs benefit analysis; Echoscopy; Economic analysis; Internal Medicine; Point of care ultrasonography","cost; echography; economics; hospital department; human; internal medicine; Italy; point of care system; retrospective study; Costs and Cost Analysis; Hospital Departments; Humans; Internal Medicine; Italy; Point-of-Care Systems; Retrospective Studies; Ultrasonography",,,,,"(2015) Nuovo Patto per la Salute per il, , http://www.governo.it/GovernoInforma/Dossier/patto_salute/Conferenza_SR.pdf, Conferenza permanente per i rapporti tra lo Stato, le Regioni e le Provincie autonome di Trento e Bolzano. 2014-2016.

Results: In 2012, the first plant-derived protein pharmaceutical (biologic) was approved for commercial use in humans. The product, a recombinant form of human β-glucocerebrosidase marketed as ELELYSO, was developed by Protalix Biotherapeutics (Carmiel, Israel). The foresight to select this particular therapeutic product for development, flawless production pipeline, and serendipity seem to provide the key in explaining how ELELYSO became the first plant-derived biologic to achieve approval by Food and Drug Administration. Conclusions: While the circumstances that enabled Protalix and its scientists to become the first to arrive at this historic milestone are perhaps unique, it is anticipated that more biologics will follow suit in winning regulatory endorsement. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ebola;

Sensor nodes are usually designed to be small and inexpensive, so they have limited capabilities, such as limited computational power, memory and energy. This paper presents novel light-weight distributed anomaly detection and a foresight response strategy based on support vector data description (SVDD) for wireless sensor network. SVDD could sometimes generate such a loose decision boundary, when some noisy samples (outliers) exist in the training set. In addition, it requires the solution of a computationally intensive quadratic programming approach which is not applicable in WSNs. Hence, we modified the standard version of SVDD, and proposed the Linear Programming-based Fuzzy-Constraint SVDD (LP-FCSVDD) method to detect the outliers with more accuracy in acceptable time. Then we present a foresight response strategy to resist the intentional, unintentional and false anomalies. The overall experiments show prominence of our proposed method to achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic wireless sensor network datasets. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Anomaly detection; Foresight response; Fuzzy constraint support vector data description; Intrusion detection; Linear programming; Wireless sensor network","Data description; Fault detection; Linear programming; Quadratic programming; Sensor nodes; Statistics; Wireless sensor networks; Anomaly detection; Computational power; Detection accuracy; Distributed anomaly detection; Foresight response; Response strategies; Support vector data description; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Intrusion detection",,,,,"Xie, M., Han, S., Tian, B., Anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks: A survey (2011) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 34 (4), pp. 1302-1325; Anwar, R.W., Bakhtiari, M., Zainal, A., Security issues and attacks in wireless sensor network (2014) World Applied Sciences Journal, 30 (10), pp. 1224-1227; (2013) International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, , Alrajeh, N.

This integration allows dynamic risk assessment by prediction, for both the sensor graph and the route graph, and thus enables evacuation route planning aware of predicted risks. The model assumes a dynamic sensor graph according to building monitoring systems and varying sensor states over time. Sensor states are then propagated to a dynamic route graph through the building with regard to passability of edges at time t, using a risk model that quantifies risks of an impact on evacuation. The paper proves the concept in an agent-based simulation, and tests this way whether foresight computed from the risk-aware model improves the evacuation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The case without uncertainty is modelled with a perfect foresight (PF) model and with uncertainty with the real option approach (ROA). In this study, uncertainties in the CO2 price, tariff received per tonne of CO2 transported, the willingness, probability and moment that sources join the CO2 transportation network are incorporated in the analysis. The results show that uncertainty leads to higher required CO2 prices before investments in carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are made. With a volatility of 47% in the CO2 price, the required CO2 price almost triples in comparison with the net present value approach. Hence, under uncertainty less sources are retrofitted with CCS and less CO2 is captured and stored over time. For instance, for the analyzed case study 31 Mt and 137 Mt CO2 is projected to be captured in the base scenario of ROA and PF model, respectively, in the period 2015-2050. If the volatility of the CO2 price is reduced with 50%, 96 Mt is projected to be captured in the ROA, which is still about one third less than in the PF model.Furthermore, the results show that uncertainty leads to less development of trunklines. All this leads to an increase in the transport and storage costs. For instance, for our case study, the average CO2 transport and storage costs in 2050 increase from 2.8 €/t to 13 €/t in the base scenario of the ROA compared to the PF model. If the volatility is reduced with 50%, the transport and storage costs decrease to 7.5 €/t in the ROA, which is still 2.5 times as much as in the PF model.Our findings indicate that the implementation of CCS can best be stimulated by reducing the volatility of the CO2 price, reducing capture costs and facilitating cooperation between nearby sources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; CO2 infrastructure; Optimization; Real option theory; Uncertainty","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Investments; Optimization; Transportation; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Infrastructure networks; Perfect foresights; Real option approaches; Real option theory; Transportation network; Uncertainty; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; comparative study; demand-side management; infrastructural development; optimization; probability; transportation system; uncertainty analysis; volatilization",,,,,"Moomaw, W., Yamba, F., Kamimoto, M., Maurice, L., Nyboer, J., Urama, K., Renewable energy and climate change (2011) IPCC special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation, pp. 1-68. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, USA, O.

The task to be performed in an informed dialogue is to assess the causes and drivers for global climate change and to produce an improved basis of scientific understanding for the implementation of the climate protection targets suggested for each country. By character, this approach integrates the political and the scientific level. Design/methodology/approach – The paper applies learning theories and options for educational technologies to socio-economic, technological, biospheric, political and scientific themes relevant to present climate change. Findings – Drivers, effects and subsequent measures are subject to highly nonlinear effects. Thus, the combination of a (scientific, fact based) “Global Change Data Base” and a (dialogic, communication based) discourse (in the spirit of “Surfing Global Change”) seems best suitable to produce solutions for the seemingly unresolvable issues of climate protection. This combination of approaches is entitled “Tackle the Task of a Transition through Technological Targets (T5)” and allows the application of hypotheses generated by students in a scaffolded setting of discursive learning. Social implications – Suggestions for CO2 abatement measures are currently passing the process of political negotiation in all countries in the world. The different views and patterns of ethical values are harmonised during the T5 learning process and symbolise the required political process of consensus finding among and between different ministries, countries and global interest groups. Originality/value – This approach includes social and natural driving factors such as population, land use, economics, politics, energy systems, the global carbon cycle, biosphere and climate, and thus offers a more comprehensive learning endeavour than many other approaches. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate protection; CO2 emissions; Economic trends; Education; Foresight; Game-based learning; Global change database; Global climate change; Problem-based learning; Surfing global change; Technology; Trend analysis",,,,,,"Ahamer, G., Training to bridge multicultural geographies of perspectives (2012) Campus-Wide Information Systems, 29 (1), pp. 21-44; Ahamer, G., Game, not fight: change climate change!

This concerns especially the field of national security. Decision makers must be able to identify threats in order to react to them adequately and so reduce risks. For this reason, a general risk management support guideline for public decision makers is developed which focuses on national security. The objective of the framework is to identify future risks, to analyze, and to evaluate them, so that concrete actions can be set to tackle the threats. The risk management framework is based on the core of the ISO 31000 risk management norm and guides the decision maker stepwise through the complex process. Therefore, several potential techniques and tools are combined in order to gain an overall picture of several scenarios. A collaboration of subject matter experts of several disciplines constitutes an important part of the process. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and EURO - The Association of European Operational Research Societies.","Collaborative processes; Knowledge management; Network analyses; Risk management; Strategic foresight",,,,,,"Aalst, W.V.D., van Hee, K.M., (2002) Workflow management.

We estimate a threshold vector autoregression (TVAR) model on US quarterly data for the period 1984-2010. We employ the spread between BAA-rated corporate bond yield and 10-year treasury constant maturity rate as a proxy for credit conditions. We find that the response of output to fiscal policy shocks is stronger and more persistent when the economy is in the 'tight' credit regime. Fiscal multipliers are significantly different in the two regimes: they are abundantly and persistently higher than one when firms face increasing financing costs, whereas they are feebler and often lower than one in the 'normal' credit regime. The results appear to be robust to different model specifications, fiscal foresight, alternative threshold variables, different measure of variables and sample periods. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,,,,"Adrian, T., Moench, E., Shin, H.S., Financial intermediation, asset prices and macroeconomic dynamics (2010) Staff report 422, , Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Afonso, A., Baxa, J., Slavik, M., Fiscal developments and financial stress: a threshold VAR analysis (2011), ECB working paper series 1319, European Central Bank; Aghion, P., Kharroubi, E., Cyclical macroeconomic policy, financial regulation and economic growth (2013) Bank for International Settlements, , BIS working paper 434; Aghion, P., Hemous, D., Kharroubi, E., Cyclical fiscal policy, credit constraints, and industry growth (2011) BIS working paper 340, , Bank for International Settlements; Almunia, M., Bénétrix, A., Eichengreen, B., O'Rourke, K.H., Rua, G., From Great Depression to Great Credit Crisis: similarities, differences and lessons (2010) Economic Policy, 25, pp. 219-265; Anderson, E., Inoue, A., Rossi, B., Heterogeneous consumers and fiscal policy shocks (2012), 2012 meeting papers 261, Society for Economic Dynamics; Atanasova, C., Credit market imperfections and business cycle dynamics: a nonlinear approach (2003) Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, 7, pp. 1-22; Auerbach, A.J., Gorodnichenko, Y., Fiscal multipliers in recession and expansion (2012) Fiscal Policy after the Financial Crisis, , National Bureau of Economic Research: Cambridge, MA; Auerbach, A.J., Gorodnichenko, Y., Measuring the output responses to fiscal policy (2012) American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 4, pp. 1-27; Bachmann, R., Sims, E.R., Confidence and the transmission of government spending shocks (2012) Journal of Monetary Economics, 59, pp. 235-249; Balduzzi, P., Brancati, E., Schiantarelli, F., Financial markets, banks' cost of funding, and firms' decisions: lessons from two crises (2013), IZA discussion papers 7872, Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA); Balke, N.S., Credit and economic activity: credit regimes and nonlinear propagation of shocks (2000) Review of Economics and Statistics, 82, pp. 344-349; Batini, N., Callegari, G., Melina, G., Successful austerity in the United States, Europe and Japan (2012), Working paper 12/190, IMF; Baum, A., Koester, G.B., The impact of fiscal policy on economic activity over the business cycle: evidence from a threshold VAR analysis (2011) Discussion paper series 1: Economic Studies No. 03/2011, , Deutsche Bundesbank; Baum, A., Checherita-Westphal, C., Rother, P., Debt and growth: new evidence for the euro area (2012), ECB working paper series 1450, European Central Bank; Baum, A., Poplawski-Ribeiro, M., Weber, A., Fiscal multipliers and the state of the economy (2012), Working paper 12/286, IMF; Bernanke, B.S., Gertler, M., Gilchrist, S., The financial accelerator and the flight to quality (1996) Review of Economics and Statistics, 78, pp. 1-15; Bernanke, B.S., Gertler, M., Gilchrist, S., The financial accelerator in a quantitative business cycle framework (1999) Handbook of Macroeconomics, pp. 1341-1393. , Taylor JB, Woodford M (eds).

Hayek anticipated the notion of ‘recursive utility’ and analytically reconstructs his informal exposition of the optimal saving process. The scope of analysis is restricted to Hayek's largely unrecognised contribution in Utility Analysis and Interest in 1936, restated as chapters 17 and 18 in The Pure Theory of Capital, first published in 1941. It is shown that Hayek characterised efficient dynamic choice as an infinite series of two-period optimality conditions by transforming an infinite-horizon optimisation problem into a perpetual confrontation of current and prospective utility, that he hinted at the axiomatic base of stationary and weakly separable dynamic preferences, and that he endogenised the subjective discount rate to substantiate his claim that the interest-rate path in a perfect-foresight equilibrium is unidirectionally determined by the marginal productivity of investment (and not by thrift). Hayek's vision of dynamic social efficiency and dynamic equilibrium is completely characterised. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","analytical reconstruction; Hayek; increasing myopia; optimal capital deepening; recursive utility",,,,,,"Araujo, A., Lack of pareto optimal allocations in economies with infinitely many commodities: the need for impatience (1985) Econometrica, 53 (2), pp. 455-461; Becker, R.A., Boyd, J.H., III, (1997) Capital theory, equilibrium analysis and recursive utility, , Malden: MA: Blackwell; Bellman, R., (1957) Dynamic programming, , Princeton: NJ: Princeton University Press; Bewley, T.F., Existence of equilibria in economies with infinitely many commodities (1972) Journal of economic theory, 4 (3), pp. 514-540; Bewley, T.F., An integration of equilibrium theory and turnpike theory (1982) Journal of mathematical economics, 10, pp. 233-267; Bliss, C.J., (1975) Capital theory and the distribution of income, , Amsterdam/New York: North-Holland/American Elsevier; Boianovsky, M., Wicksell, Ramsey and the theory of interest (1998) Journal of the history of economic thought, 5 (1), pp. 140-168; Böhm-Bawerk, E., (1959) Capital and interest, 2. , Huncke G.D., Sennholz H.F., (eds), South Holland: Libertarian Press; Boldrin, M., Paths of optimal growth in two-sector models (1989) Economic complexity: chaos, sunspots, bubbles and nonlinearity, pp. 231-252. , Barnett W.A., Geweke J., Shell K., (eds), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Boldrin, M., Montrucchio, L., On the indeterminacy of optimal capital accumulation paths (1986) Journal of economic theory, 40 (1), pp. 26-39; Bortkiewicz, L., Der Kardinalfehler der Böhm-Bawerkschen Zinstheorie (1906) Schmollers jahrbuch, 30 (3), pp. 61-90; Burmeister, E., Wicksell effects (1990) The new palgrave: capital theory, pp. 257-261. , Eatwell J., Milgate M., Newman P., (eds), New York: W.

Human factors such as faulty risk cognition, bounded rationality, groupthink, failure of foresight and organizational learning, suspect motivations, reactive attitudes, and inappropriate risk decision-making, are commonly associated characteristics of such shortcomings. This article summarizes and discusses underlying managerial and non-technical factors in human-created major hazard accidents in the light of theories of accident causation, findings from disaster inquiries and published research, and the systemic holism-versus-reductionism debate. Ideally, all site operators would know and understand disaster aetiology and preventive requirements and be motivated to enact them. However, there is sufficient empirical evidence from inquiry reports into major hazard incidents and disasters that idealized enactment rarely occurs and in many cases safety policy and strategy as enacted is distant from espoused safety policy and strategy. Research questions relating to board level thinking and actions on major hazard risks are posited and a proposal for a more holistic and potentially more effective major hazard safety research framework is put forward. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Disasters; Major hazards; Risk decisions; Safety culture; Safety management","Accidents; Behavioral research; Decision making; Disasters; Hazards; Managers; Risks; Major hazard accidents; Major hazards; Non-technical factors; Organizational learning; Risk decision; Safety culture; Safety management; Safety management systems; Safety engineering; accident prevention; attitude; authority; cognition; decision making; disaster; hazard assessment; human; manager; motivation; priority journal; Review; risk management; safety",,,,,"Ackoff, R.L., Towards a system of system concepts (1971) J.

Moreover, some of their policies might be judged inconsistent with the WTO, even if adopted in order to address externalities and distortions. To illustrate, we assume that Home, a WTO member, wishes to employ one of three instruments of different ‘intensity’ (labelling, domestic tax, and subsidy) to mitigate climate change. Can it do so while respecting its obligations under the WTO contract? Our response is affirmative when Home chooses the second option, and negative when it uses the first and the third options. The negative response is due to the bizarre manner in which the WTO Appellate Body, the highest court in the WTO infrastructure, has understood non-discrimination in the context of the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement, and the inertia/lack of foresight by trade delegates who did not extend the carve-out for ‘green subsidies’ that had been agreed in 1995 beyond 2000. Needed changes at the multilateral level require delegation of sovereignty to move towards a contract that would require positive steps from the WTO membership in order to avert climate change. As an immediate amendment, the reinsertion of the clause of non-actionable subsidies should be considered. Until greater delegation of sovereignty is accepted, the fight against climate change on the trade front will be substantially aided if the WTO were to embrace and accommodate clubs that have endorsed this objective. © 2015, Centre for Economic Policy Research.

It offers many interesting features that inspired the design of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) to solve several kinds of engineering problems. As a manufacturing system can be assimilated to a host organism, while process anomalies (e.g. faults, errors and failures) can be considered as disease causing elements, biological immunity is particularly inspiring approaches for fault detection, diagnosis and recovery (FDDR). Although many interesting works and different adaptations were suggested, we are not aware of any recent survey that would aim at reviewing works, synthesizing modeling approaches and reporting on results in this field. This paper provides a recent survey and an analysis framework to fill in this gap. After a first part overviewing FDDR needs and requirements, we introduce biological immunity and highlight the main concepts and mechanisms that are particularly relevant to FDDR problems. The numerous works analyzed distinguish three categories of AIS: one-signal (for positive and negative selection) based approaches, two-signal (for danger and NK) based approaches and immune network based approaches. We suggest a possible architecture for FDDR systems, and organize the immune system concepts, components and mechanisms in such a way to show how they are applied for each of the detection, diagnosis and recovery tasks. Our analysis allows an overview of current technical and methodical developments in this field and foresight of future research perspectives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial Immune Systems; Detection; Diagnosis; Fault; Manufacturing systems; Recovery; Review","Diagnosis; Error detection; Faulting; Immune system; Manufacture; Recovery; Reviews; Surveys; Analysis frameworks; Artificial Immune System; Engineering problems; Methodical development; Natural systems; Negative selection; System concepts; Three categories; Fault detection",,,,,"Araujo, M., Aguilar, J., Aponte, H., Fault detection system in gas lift well based on artificial immune system (2003) Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 3 (2003), pp. 1673-1677; Aydin, I., Karakose, M., Akin, E., Chaotic-based hybrid negative selection algorithm and its applications in fault and anomaly detection (2010) Expert Syst.

This weakness means that it is unclear why the conclusions reached by these approaches should be considered valid, for example in anticipatory ethical assessment or governance of emerging technologies. This paper explains and responds to this problem by proposing an account of how the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims can be established in ethical and political discourses based on Jürgen Habermas’ discourse ethics. To better understand the nature of the problem, the relationship between norms, facts and the future is explored in light of potential meta-ethical fallacies faced in the field of empirical ethics. Weaknesses of current approaches to anticipatory ethical assessment and governance are then explored, including the Precautionary Principle and Technology Assessment. We argue that the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims can be understood within Habermas’ approach to political discourse, which requires ‘translation’ of uncertain claims to be comprehensible to other stakeholders in discourse. Translation thus provides a way to allow for uncertain normative claims to be considered alongside other types of validity claims in discourse. The paper contributes a conceptual account of the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims in discourse and begins to develop a ‘methodology of translation’ which can be further developed for approaches to research and ethical assessment supporting anticipatory evidence-based policy, governance and system design. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Anticipatory governance; Emerging technologies; Empirical ethics; Epistemology; Evidence-based policy; Habermas; Technology assessment",,,,,,"Ahmed, A., Skogh, G., Choices at various levels of uncertainty: an experimental test of the restated diversification theorem (2006) J Risk Uncertain, 33, pp. 183-196; Baldwin, C., Widdershoven, G., Family carers, ethics and dementia: an empirical study (2008) Empirical Ethics in Psychiatry, pp. 107-122. , Oxford University Press, New York; Banks, G., Evidence-based policy making: what is it?

The message of the paper is that sustainability requires a significant input from Ergonomics/Human Factors, but the profession needs some expansion in its thinking in order to make this contribution. Creating a future sustainable world in which people experience an acceptable way of life will not happen without a large input from manufacturing industry into all the Global Drivers, both in delivering products that meet sustainability criteria (such as durability, reliability, minimised material requirement and low energy consumption), and in developing sustainable processes to deliver products for sustainability (such as minimum waste, minimum emissions and low energy consumption). Appropriate changes are already being implemented in manufacturing industry, including new business models, new jobs and new skills. Considerable high-level planning around the world is in progress and is bringing about these changes; for example, there is the US 'Advanced Manufacturing National Program' (AMNP)', the German 'Industrie 4.0' plan, the French plan 'la nouvelle France industrielle' and the UK Foresight publications on the 'Future of Manufacturing'. All of these activities recognise the central part that humans will continue to play in the new manufacturing paradigms; however, they do not discuss many of the issues that systems ergonomics professionals acknowledge. This paper discusses a number of these issues, highlighting the need for some new thinking and knowledge capture by systems ergonomics professionals. Among these are ethical issues, job content and skills issues. Towards the end, there is a summary of knowledge extensions considered necessary in order that systems ergonomists can be fully effective in this new environment, together with suggestions for the means to acquire and disseminate the knowledge extensions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.","Manufacturing; Sustainability; Systems ergonomics","Energy security; Energy utilization; Ergonomics; Food supply; Manufacture; Mobile security; Advanced manufacturing; Low energy consumption; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing paradigm; Material requirements; Sustainability criteria; Sustainable manufacturing; Sustainable process; Sustainable development; Article; climate; commercial phenomena; community safety; community security; cost; cultural anthropology; decision making; demography; energy security; ethics; food security; global driver; human; identity; information technology; informed consent; landfill; learning; nformed command; personal autonomy; planning; processing; quality control; recycling; resource depletion; social aspect; social behavior; sustainability engineering; system ergonomics; traffic and transport; workload; bioengineering; environmental protection; health; manufacturing industry; procedures; trends; Conservation of Natural Resources; Global Health; Human Engineering; Humans; Manufacturing Industry",,,,,"Directive on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their re-usability, recyclability and recoverability (2005/64/EC).

A re-examination of the case law suggests that a mens rea conception of foresight plus endorsement might be within interpretative reach. The paper considers possible objections to such a development but ultimately rejects them. It concludes that it is not necessary to wait for Parliament to put in place reforms: joint enterprise is a creature of the common law, and the common law is able to tame it unaided. © Cambridge Law Journal and Contributors 2015.","accessorial liability; criminal law; joint enterprise; mens rea; murder",,,,,,"Similar examples are discussed in R v Hyde (1991) Q.B, 1, p. 134. , (CA), 138D;; R v Gnango (2011) UKSC, p. 59; (2012) A.C, 1, p. 827. , at [14]; R v Woollin (1999) A.C, 1, p. 82. , (HL); R v Cunningham (1982) A.C, p. 566. , (HL); R v Rahman (2008) UKHL, p. 45; (2009) A.C, 1, p. 129. , at [33]; R v Powell (1999) A.C, 1, p. 1. , (HL);; Rahman (2008) UKHL, p. 45; (2009) A.C, 1, p. 129; R v Mendez and Thompson (2010) EWCA Crim, p. 516; (2011) Q.B, p. 876; R v A and others (2010) EWCA Crim, p. 1622; (2011) Q.B, p. 841; R v Stringer (2011) EWCA Crim, p. 1396; (2012) Q.B, p. 160; R v Carpenter (2011) EWCA Crim, p. 2568; Gnango (2011) UKSC, p. 59; (2012) A.C, 1, p. 827; R v Jogee (2013) EWCA Crim, p. 1433; R v Odegbune (2013) EWCA Crim, p. 711; R v Winston and Collins (2015) EWCA Crim, p. 524; Gnango (2011) UKSC, p. 59; (2012) A.C, 1, p. 827. , at [42]; (2011) Q.B, p. 841. , at [27], per Hughes L.J; Virgo, G., The doctrine of joint enterprise liability (2010) Arch.

Using primary data enumerated from 501 micro-entrepreneurs randomly sampled across different strata—gender, caste/ethnicity, enterprise category and ecological belts in Nepal in 2013 for the years 2068 BS (April 2011–March 2012) and 2069 BS (April 2012–March 2013) and executing the multiple linear regression models, the study primarily focused on identifying the factors determining the microenterprise performance. The study revealed that the entrepreneur-related factors, particularly gender, managerial skills, need for achievement, need for autonomy, creative tendency, internal locus of control and managerial foresight; enterprise-related factors, particularly enterprise age, enterprise size and initial financial constraint; and environment-related factor, particularly social network, were the key factors determining the performance of microenterprises in Nepal. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Development; Entrepreneur; Microenterprise; Performance; Poverty",,,,,,"Ajibefun, I.A., Daramola, A.G., Determinants of technical and allocative efficiency of microenterprises: Firm-level evidence from Nigeria (2003) African Development Review, 15 (2-3), pp. 353-395; Amsteus, M., Managerial foresight: Concept and measurement (2008) Foresight, 10 (1), pp. 53-66; Amsteus, M., Managerial foresight: Measurement scale and estimation (2011) Foresight, 13 (1), pp. 58-76; Amsteus, M., Managers’ foresight matters (2011) Foresight, 13 (2), pp. 64-78; Awang, A., Yusof, A.A., Kassim, K.M., Ismail, M., Zain, R.S., Madar, A.R.S., Entrepreneurial orientation and performance relations of Malaysian Bumiputera SMEs: The impact of some perceived environmental factors (2009) International Journal of Business Management, 4 (9), pp. 84-96; Ayyagari, M., Beck, T., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., (2005) Small and microenterprise across the globe, , http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/84797-1114437274304/SME_globe.pdf; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Binayee, S.B., Sapkota, I.B., Subedi, B.P., Pun, L., Micro-finance for small scale tree and forest products enterprises: Opportunities and challenges for the local procedures in forestry sector- Nepal microfinance case study (2004) Report, , Asia Network for Sustainable Agriculture and Bioresources: Nepal; Boermans, M.A., Willebrands, D., Financial constraints, risk taking and firm performance: Recent evidence from microfinance clients in Tanzania.

Today, it includes both qualitative and quantitative elements. The aims of this scoping review are to give an overview of the application of the scenario method in the fields of health care and to make suggestions for better reporting in future scenario projects. Methods: Between January 2013 and October 2013 we conducted a systematic search in the databases Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Eric, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cinahl since inception for the term 'scenario(s)' in combination with other terms, e.g. method, model, and technique. Our search was not restricted by date or language. In addition, we screened the reference lists of the included articles. Results: A total of 576 bibliographical records were screened. After removing duplicates and three rounds of screening, 41 articles covering 38 different scenario projects were included for the final analysis. Nine of the included articles addressed disease related issues, led by mental health and dementia (n∈=∈4), and followed by cancer (n∈=∈3). Five scenario projects focused on public health issues at an organizational level and five focused on the labor market for different health care professionals. In addition, four projects dealt with health care 'in general', four with the field of biotechnology and personalized medicine, and additional four with other technology developments. Some of the scenario projects suffered from poor reporting of methodological aspects. Conclusions: Despite its potential, use of the scenario method seems to be published rarely in comparison to other methods such as the Delphi-technique, at least in the field of health care. This might be due to the complexity of the methodological approach. Individual project methods and activities vary widely and are poorly reported. Improved criteria are required for reporting of scenario project methods. With improved standards and greater transparency, the scenario method will be a good tool for scientific health care planning and strategic decision-making in public health. © 2015 Vollmar et al.","Decision-making; Forecasting; Foresight; Health planning; Planning techniques; Policy making; Public health administration; Scenario method","clinical decision making; computer simulation; health care personnel; health care planning; human; management; mental health; procedures; public health service; Clinical Decision-Making; Computer Simulation; Health Personnel; Health Planning; Humans; Mental Health; Policy Making; Public Health Administration",,,,,"Yost, J., Dobbins, M., Traynor, R., DeCorby, K., Workentine, S., Greco, L., Tools to support evidence-informed public health decision making (2014) BMC Public Health, 14, p. 728. , 4223550 25034534; Devenish, G., Pollard, C., Kerr, D., (2012) The Delphi Process for Public Health Policy Development: Five Things You Need to Know, 14. , Western Australia: Curtin University; Ferri, C.P., Prince, M., Brayne, C., Brodaty, H., Fratiglioni, L., Ganguli, M., Hall, K., Huang, Y., Global prevalence of dementia: A Delphi consensus study (2005) Lancet, 366 (9503), pp. 2112-2117. , 2850264 16360788; Gensichen, J., Vollmar, H.C., Sönnichsen, A., Waldmann, U.M., Sandars, J., E-learning for education in primary healthcare - Turning the hype into reality: A Delphi study (2009) Eur J Gen Pract, 15 (1), pp. 11-14. , 19353427; Diamond, I.R., Grant, R.C., Feldman, B.M., Pencharz, P.B., Ling, S.C., Moore, A.M., Wales, P.W., Defining consensus: A systematic review recommends methodologic criteria for reporting of Delphi studies (2014) J Clin Epidemiol, 67 (4), pp. 401-409. , 24581294; Fone, D., Hollinghurst, S., Temple, M., Round, A., Lester, N., Weightman, A., Roberts, K., Palmer, S., Systematic review of the use and value of computer simulation modelling in population health and health care delivery (2003) J Public Health Med, 25 (4), pp. 325-335. , 14747592; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes - New participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22 (2-3), pp. 93-111; Landeta, J., Current validity of the Delphi method in social sciences (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73 (5), pp. 467-482; Glenn, J.C., (2011) Futures Research Methodology Version 30, p. 52. , The Futures Group International.

This aspiration inevitably resonates with technology developers and suppliers, yet is only valid if 'smart' is truly smart and not doing what we already do more efficiently - there is an imperative to re-engineer our cities to live within what our planet can provide and protect it for future generations, while prioritizing peoples' wellbeing. Herein lies the greater, more inspiring, challenge, and one that provides the focus for sensor technology development. This paper outlines the Liveable Cities and UK Foresight Future of Cities projects, and a method for future-proofing proposed urban interventions. However, the above neglects the existing fabric of our cities - the context in which new interventions must operate effectively. This is where remote sensing, and GPR in particular, has a crucial role to play. Mapping the Underworld, and it successor Assessing the Underworld, make explicit GPR's potential and, crucially, shifts the focus of attention from buried pipes and cables to the road structure and the ground (which supports them both). The research is predicated on the potential for combined sensors, deployed at the surface and in-pipe, to reveal the layout and condition of the urban shallow subsurface. An intelligent combination of widespread instrumentation and remote sensing could move cities towards a far more sustainable and resilient, and therefore truly smart, future - GPR is a core part of this future. © 2015 IEEE.","asset management; future cities; infrastructure","Asset management; Big data; Geological surveys; Radar; Remote sensing; Combined sensors; Focus of Attention; future cities; Future generations; infrastructure; Multiple interpretations; Sensor technologies; Shallow subsurface; Ground penetrating radar systems",,,,,"Leach, J.M., Lee, S.E., Braithwaite, P.A., Bouch, C.J., Grayson, N., Rogers, C.D.F., What makes a city liveable?

This analysis aims to expose or make visible the scopic regimes at work when interpreting the event. By referencing Judith Butler’s “frame theory” (2009) and Nicholas Mirzoeff’s “the right to look” (2011), the event is unpacked, among other things, as the volatile intersection of differing world views and technics of vision. Three scopic frames are used to interrogate the event: the first aims to unmask “oversights” during the event, whereas the remaining two deal more with inversions of sight which bear on “foresight” and “insight”. In terms of oversight, the first frame refers to the overseeing or invigilation of the event via instruments of visuality or vision machines (e.g. satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and helicopters), promising complete transparency. The second oversight comes in the representations of the events as media spectacle, becoming part of a new mediated visibility. The final oversight refers to the miners as subalterns becoming visible in a system that renders them invisible from the start. The second cluster of the visual complex, namely the appeal to foresight, surfaces through the calling on a Sangoma (traditional healer) for muti (traditional medicine) to render the miners invincible/invisible to the enemy. The third and final cluster refers to artists Ayanda Mabulu’s Yakhal’inkomo—Black man’s cry (2013) and Mary Wafer’s Mine exhibition (2012), aiming to provide some insight into the unrepresentability of the event. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","aerial view; countervisuality; magic/occult; Marikana massacre; scopic regimes; subterranean; visuality",,,,,,"Achebe, C., An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness’ (1977) Massachusetts Review, 18, pp. 1783-1794; Azoulay, A., (2008) The Civil Contract of Photography, , New York: Zone Books; Azoulay, A., What is a Photograph?

Box 1300, Tampere, 33101, Finland","The design, management and evaluation of foresight is challenging firstly due to the vast diversity of foresight practices and secondly due to its embeddedness in the context of other policy processes. To help overcome these challenges we look at the contributions of foresight from multiple perspectives in a systemic way and propose the concept of multi-layered foresight, which analyses the contributions of foresight to knowledge, relations and capabilities on four layers: landscape, system, organisation and individual. We construct these layers building on earlier literature and illustrate them with a case example from the region of Antofagasta in Chile. We argue that foresight exercises benefit from considering multiple levels and respective different emphases in analysis. For instance, on the landscape layer the focus tends to be on contributions to knowledge while on the organisational layer it is more on capabilities. The layers help position the foresight exercise and its effects in relation to the broader context. Thus, we expect the concept of multi-layered foresight to support the design, management and evaluation of foresight. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Foresight; Foresight design; Foresight evaluation; Innovation system","design; innovation; knowledge; planning method; regional planning; Antofagasta; Chile",,,,,"Alkemade, F., Kleinschmidt, C., Hekkert, M., Analysing emerging innovation systems: a functions approach to foresight (2007) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 3 (2), pp. 139-168; Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Andersen, P.D., Andersen, A.D., Jensen, P.A., Rasmussen, B., Sectoral innovation system foresight in practice: nordic facilities management foresight (2014) Futures, 61, pp. 33-44; Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Innovation system foresight (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 88, pp. 276-286; (2002) The globalizing learning economy, , Oxford University Press, D.

While there are many descriptions of the benefits of foresight, there is little research into how these benefits are created. In addition, although the view of innovations has shifted towards a systems understanding, the same has not happened with foresight, which is largely seen as a process. The process view and focus on the outcomes has created a situation where the dynamics between agents involved in foresight is still not well understood. One emerging approach to improve the understanding of the dynamics of foresight, and to embed foresight more closely with innovation management and policy, is the systems view. In this paper, we build on the systems view of foresight, and study what the elements in foresight as a system are and how they contribute to the creation of futures knowledge. Based on the literature, we propose six elements that are useful for understanding a foresight system and the creation of futures knowledge: agents, cognitive schemes, strategic objects, mediating events, memory objects and metaphors. We illustrate the systems view, the elements and their interaction with two case examples: one on creating future-orientation in a research and technology organisation and one on renewing a forest industry through roadmapping. Based on the elements and the case studies, we argue that the strategic objects and mediating events are important leverage points when steering foresight as a system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Complex adaptive systems; Foresight system; Future-orientation; Innovation systems","corporate strategy; future prospect; innovation",,,,,"Ahlqvist, T., Anticipatory knowledge, epistemic communities, and future-oriented innovation practices (2012) Proceedings of the 5th ISPIM Innovation Symposium; Dufva, M., Ahlqvist, T., Knowledge creation dynamics in foresight: a knowledge typology and exploratory method to analyse foresight workshops (2015) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 94, pp. 251-268; Dufva, M., Könnölä, T., Koivisto, R., Multi-layered foresight: lessons from regional foresight in Chile (2015) Futures, , (in press); Dufva, M., Myllyoja, J., Ahlqvist, T., Building organisational future orientation: example from research and technology organisation (2013) Proceedings of the Ispim Annual Conference, p. 2013; Ahlqvist, T., Dufva, M., Kettle, J., Vanderhoek, N., Hytönen, E., Niemelä, K., Strategic roadmapping, industry renewal, and cluster creation: case Green Triangle (2013) Proceedings of the 6th ISPIM Innovation Symposium; Ackoff, R.L., The systems revolution (1974) Long Range Planning, 7 (6), pp. 2-20; Alkemade, F., Kleinschmidt, C., Hekkert, M., Analysing emerging innovation systems: a functions approach to foresight (2007) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 3 (2), pp. 139-168; Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Innovation system foresight (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 88, pp. 276-286; Anderson, P., Perspective: complexity theory and organization science (1999) Organization Science, 10 (3), pp. 216-232; Barré, R., Foresight and their themes: analysis, typology and perspectives (2002) Conference Proceedings: The Role of Foresight in the Selection of Research Policy Priorities; Barre, R., Innovation systems dynamics and the positioning of Europe.

FTA practitioners have used frequently one or a suitable mixture of these methods for their activities. Changing policy and strategy making contexts as well as enabling technologies increased the need and possibility for performing adaptive Foresight studies in order to improve decision making about the future and using making better use of limited resources. This study performs a scientometric analysis of the publications in the major FTA journals with the aim of understanding the dynamics of using Foresight methods across time. Among the other branches of FTA, including forecasting, futures, and technology assessment, a special emphasis is given on Foresight as a systematic and inclusive way of exploring long term futures, developing visions and formulating policies for action. The study aims at detecting the key Trends and Weak Signals regarding the use of existing methods and emerging ones with potential uses for Foresight activities. Further implications will be achieved with the generation of networks for quantitative and qualitative methods. This will demonstrate the most frequently combined Foresight methods by researchers and practitioners. Where possible the methods will also be cross-fertilised with the key thematic areas to illustrate the relationships between policy domains and industrial sectors covered by the scope of study with methodological choice. This output is considered to be taken as a methodological guide for any researchers, practitioners or policy makers, who might embark upon or involved in a Foresight activity. Further outputs of the study will include the identification of centres of excellence in the use of Foresight methods and collaboration networks between countries, institutions and policy domains. Overall, the paper demonstrates how scientometric tools can be used to understand the dynamics of evolution in a research field. Thus, it provides an overview of the use of methods in Foresight, and how it is distinguished from the other FTA activities; the evolutionary characteristics of methodological design and factors influencing the choice of methods; and finally a discussion on the future potentials for new cutting-edge approaches. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Foresight; Foresight methods; FTA; Scientometrics",,,,,,"(2009) Mapping Foresight: revealing how Europe and other world regions navigate into the future, European Foresight Monitoring Network (EFMN), , European Commission, Brussels; Hess, D.J., (1997) Science studies: An advanced introduction, , New York University Press, New York; Keller, J., von der Gracht, H.A., The influence of information and communication technology (ICT) on future Foresight process—Results from a Delphi survey (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 85, pp. 81-92; www.cgee.org.br/atividades/redirKori/290, Miles, I., & Keenan, M.

Assuming an isoelastic demand function and possibly different marginal costs for the two groups of firms, we focus on the local stability of the Nash equilibrium. We show that, with respect to the oligopoly composition, described in terms of the fraction of rational firms, different scenarios are possible. We find that a high rationality degree may not always guarantee stability, in particular when rational firms have sufficiently larger marginal costs. In fact, in this situation, increasing the fraction of rational firms can even introduce instability. Besides the usual scenarios in which replacing some naive firms with rational ones leads to a stabilization of (or at least keeps unchanged) the dynamics, we provide a family of situations, characterized by costs ratio favorable to naive firms, in which equilibrium loses its stability when naive firms are replaced by rational ones.

In two studies, 4- and 6-year-olds (N=. 160) received structurally analogous search and planning tasks that required retrospective or prospective temporal-causal reasoning, respectively. The search task was compared with a closely matched control task that did not require temporal-causal reasoning. Results revealed that (a) both age groups solved the control task, (b) 6-year-olds mastered both retrospective and prospective tasks, and (c) 4-year-olds showed limited competence in both retrospective and prospective tasks.

Based on this, here we introduce briefly the science of the space gravitational wave detection, as a new measure of astronomical observations, as well as the scientific objectives and potential detectivity of the design for the Chinese space gravitational wave detection mission.","Binary black hole coalescence; Gravitational wave; intermediate mass black hole; ΛCDM hierarchical structure formation picture",,,,,,"New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics (2010), National Research Council.

The integration of capital markets is seen as one such area of transformation. The research presented in this article studies one integration initiative that took shape around the proposed combination of a number of key European securities marketplaces through the development of a cross-border settlement system. Taking a sociotechnical approach, the research presents the positions of the key actants identified in relation to key controversies regarding the development of the settlement system and shows how the relations between the controversies and the positions of the actants involved in them evolve. By examining the role of ICTs in the evolution of these relations, the study seeks to illuminate the complex causalities between the social and technical aspects of cross-border capital market integration. The article argues that in addition to enabling the interconnecting of an expanded set of transacting parties, ICTs bring important cognitive dimensions that enable the inspiration, planning, and foresight necessary for both developers and market participants to formulate their plans, strategies, and positions vis-à-vis the expanded and transformed marketplace arrangements. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","CSDs; Globalisation; Integration; Marketplace; Markets; Securities; Settlement; Technology","Financial markets; Integration; Marketing; Mobile security; Technology; CSDs; Globalisation; Marketplace; Securities; Settlement; Commerce; capital market; economic integration; globalization; information and communication technology",,,,,"Akrich, M., The de-scription of technical objects (1992) Shaping Technology/Building Society, , MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), W.E.

Then, we use historical Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) data from 2011-2013 to evaluate the maximum potential revenue from a hypothetical 32 MWh, 8 MW system. We investigate the maximum potential revenue from two different scenarios: arbitrage only and arbitrage combined with regulation. This analysis was performed for each load zone over the same period to show the impact of location and to identify trends in the opportunities for energy storage. Our analysis shows that, with perfect foresight, participation in the regulation market would have produced more than twice the revenue compared to arbitrage in the ERCOT market in 2011-2013. Over the last three years, there has been a significant decrease in the potential revenue for an energy storage system. We also quantify the impact of location on potential revenue. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Linear programming; Location; Day ahead market; Electrical energy storages; Energy storage systems; On potentials; Perfect foresights; Potential revenue; Recent trends; Regulation markets; Digital storage",,,,,"Stoft, S., (2011) Power System Economics: Designing Markets for Electricity, , Piscataway, New Jersey: IEEE Press and John Wiley & Sons; Final Rule Order 755: Frequency Regulation Compensation in the Organized Wholesale Power Markets, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Oct. 2011, 137 FERC 61,064; (2013) Fast Responding Regulation Service, , http://www.ercot.com/mktrules/pilots/frrs/index, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Nov; Bhatnagar, D., Currier, A., Hernandez, J., Ma, O., Kirby, B., (2013) Market and Policy Barriers to Energy Storage Deployment: A Study for the Energy Storage Systems Program, , Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, Tech.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors draw insights from illustrative cases, i.e. Swissair, Sabena and Cameroon Airlines to illustrate their theoretical analysis. Findings – The study shed light on the effects of internal and external factors in precipitating business closures. The authors established that top executives’ hubris, resistance to change and over-reliance on external consultants are some of precursors to organisational closure. Research limitations/implications – The analysis of this paper provides a range of strategies that organisations can pursue to learn from other firms’ closure and improve their survivability and chances of future success. Originality/value – Despite a growing body of literature on strategic foresight and organisational closure, the literature has largely developed in isolation and as such the understanding of the relationship between strategic foresight and organisational closure has remained severely limited. The paper integrates these two streams of research to enrich the understanding of how firms can learn from others to improve their strategic foresight. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adaptability; Business planning; Human capital; Learning; Strategy",,,,,,"Ahuja, G., Coff, R.W., Lee, P.M., Managerial foresight and attempted rent appropriation: Insider trading on knowledge of imminent breakthroughs (2005) Strategic Management Journal, 26 (9), pp. 791-808; Amankwah-Amoah, J., Learning from the failures of others: The effects of post-exit knowledge spillovers on recipient firms (2011) Journal of Workplace Learning, 23 (6), pp. 358-375; Amankwah-Amoah, J., Cauterizing trial by fire: Observers' interpretations of organizational failure (2013) Journal of General Management, 38 (3), pp. 51-72; Amankwah-Amoah, J., Old habits die hard: A tale of two failed companies and an unwanted inheritance (2014) Journal of Business Research, 67 (9), pp. 1894-1903; Amankwah-Amoah, J., A unified framework of explanations for strategic persistence in the wake of others' failures (2014) Journal of Strategy and Management, 7 (4), pp. 422-444; Amankwah-Amoah, J., Governments, airlines and employees: An evolving relationship from 1940 to 2010 (2014) Management & Organizational History, 10 (1), pp. 1-20; Amankwah-Amoah, J., Debrah, Y.A., The protracted collapse of Ghana Airways: Lessons in organizational failure (2010) Group & Organization Management, 35 (3), pp. 636-665; Amankwah-Amoah, J., Debrah, Y.A., Air Afrique: The demise of a continental icon (2014) Business History, 56 (4), pp. 517-546; Amankwah-Amoah, J., Zhang, N., Sarpong, D., Leaving behind a turbulent past: Insights of divestments from China (2013) Strategic Change, 22 (5-6), pp. 295-306; Bonsu, H., (2001) A nation in shock: Swissair crisis, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/1677085.stm, BBC, (accessed 25 July 2014); Brooke, J., (1999) A bit of peace for Swissair crash families, , www.nytimes.com/1999/09/03/world/a-bit-of-peace-for-swissair-crash-families.html, NY Times, (accessed 25 January 2014); Buerkle, T., Anderson, R., Who lost Swissair?

Disasters such as Katrina (2005), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) Floods (2013), and Super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are examples that highlight the vulnerability of communities to natural hazards and the crippling effect they have on the social and economic well-being. Through foresight and scenario planning, such events can be expected but can they be predicted to support resilience and enable suppression of the impacts? With consideration of emerging and systemic risks and inherent uncertainty associated with surprising events, planning for and managing risk, crisis and disasters requires understanding of the outliers that challenge our resilience. 'Black Swans' represent the unpredictable. They represent ""... our misunderstanding of the likelihood of surprises"" (Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, 2007). A 'Black Swan' is described by Taleb (2007) as that which is an outlier, that which is outside the realm of regular expectations which carries with it an extreme impact such as natural disasters, market crashes, catastrophic failure of complex socio-technical systems and terrorist events such as 9/11. Sornette (Int J Terraspace Sci Eng 2(1):1-18, 2009) identifies a different class of extreme events (outliers) that he calls 'Dragon Kings'. Sornette (2009) argues that Dragon Kings may have properties that make them not only identifiable in real time but also predictable. The evolving science on complexity (and, more specifically, on complex networks) and on resilience suggest that modeling and simulation of such extreme events can assist in the predictability and the suppression of low probability extremely high consequence events such as natural hazards (flood, earthquake, wildfire, tsunami, extreme weather), cyber-attacks, and financial events. Furthermore, the science of complex networks is developing rapidly and has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of complexity, potentially leading to innovative methods for the prediction of emergent behavior on natural and technological networks, as well as specific strategies for designing networks that are more resistant (resilient) to both failure and attack. Governments and owners of critical physical and digital infrastructure may benefit from analyses, advice and exercises that involve predictable and suppressible ""Dragon-King"" type of low probability extremely high consequence extreme events, as well as from the utilization of recent advances in complex network theory, to ultimately enhance resiliency. This chapter contributes to the discourse on Dragon Kings arguing for continued and concerted efforts to explore this domain. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Players imagined future temporal outcomes through remixing media. In a qualitative analysis of actual game play during the real-time introduction of the game for teaching organizational communication, Evoke became a platform for student inquiry for questioning its underlying design as an expansion of territorial and temporal conquest. Evoke served as a springboard for building a literacy of critical time among students in accessing stakeholder power to determine the future. Students challenged, created, and followed the cultural capital of promissory visions in circulation. The curriculum design for using serious and forecasting games like Evoke must account for the conceptual development of what Sarah Sharma calls critical time or chronopolitics, a hidden politics of time that shapes our approaches to cultures, organizations, and innovation. By placing spatial and temporal dynamics center stage, we investigated how serious games produce a chronopolitics of time differentiating among people by class and ethnicity. Alternative Reality Games offer the potential for building a literacy of critical forecasting time to understand the practices for anticipating the future as temporal networks of power, different and uneven. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","critical time; foresight; online gaming; temporal class; temporal empire",,,,,,"Agger, B., (1989) Fast capitalism, , Arlington, TX, University of Illinois Press; (2011) What is an Evoke?, , http://vimeo.com/9723245, [Vimeo post].

With the rapid development of communication technologies and mobile devices, educational data have been generated at an unprecedented pace. The emerging highly flexible and scalable approaches to data processing and analysis allow us to extract new insights and meaningful information from educational data that can benefit students, teachers and the whole education ecosystem. This paper introduces some new opportunities for Big Data analytics to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of students' learning and maximise their knowledge retention. First, we propose to use supervised learning algorithms, i.e. classification or regression, to try to predict student academic performance and thereby give an an early feedback for the expected achievements, both, during the course and before the course selection process. Second, we propose to use these predictions to guide the modules, courses and content recommendation that maximizes students' potential reflected in their learning abilities, areas of interest, goals of education and career. Third, we propose to focus on the mechanics of the students' learning process and try to identify the optimal format, style, pace and organisation of the knowledge acquisition process that would lead to measurable improvements in the attained academic performance and knowledge retention in the long run. Finally, we take the introduced learning optimisation approaches together and try to formulate flexible delivery via personalization of the individual students' journeys through the educational curriculum that leave them satisfied with more knowledge delivered quicker and retained longer. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Curricula; Data handling; Data mining; Digital signal processing; Education; Learning algorithms; Mobile devices; Signal processing; Students; Teaching; Academic performance; Communication technologies; Content recommendations; Data processing and analysis; Flexible delivery; Knowledge retention; Learning abilities; Scalable approach; Big data",,,,,"Smolan, R., Erwitt, J., (2012) The Human Face of Big Data, , November; Schmarzo, B., (2014) What Universities Can Learn from Big Data Higher Education Analytics, , https://infocus.emc.com, July; King, I., Big education in the era of big data (2014) Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, , September; Nghe, N.T., Multi-relational factorization models for predicting student performance (2011) KDD 2011 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Educational Data; Feng, M., Heffernan, N., Koedinger, K., Addressing the assessment challenge with an online system that tutors as it assesses (2009) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 19 (3), pp. 243-266; Thai-Nghe, N., Horvath, N., Schmidt-Thieme, L., Factorization models for forecasting student performance (2011) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Educational Data Mining; Ruta, D., Powell, L., Wang, D., Hirsch, B., Ng, J., Self-organising p2p learning for 21c education (2013) International Symposium on Smart Learning for the Next Generation; Hirsch, B., Hitt, G.W., Powell, L., Khalaf, K., Balawi, S., Collaborative learning in action (2013) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assess-ment and Learning for Engineering, , Bali, Indonesia; Bruffee, K., (1993) Collaborative Learning, , Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press; Dillenbourg, P., Collaborative learning: Cognitive and computational approaches (1999) Advances in Learning and Instruction Series, , New York, NY: Elsevier Science, Inc; Mitnik, R., Recabarren, M., Nussbaum, M., Soto, A., Collaborative robotic instruction: A graph teaching experience (2009) Computers and Education, 53 (2), pp. 330-342; Lee, Y., Cho, J., An intelligent course recommendation system (2011) Smart Computing Review, 1 (1), pp. 69-84. , October; Sobecki, J., Tomczak, J.M., Intelligent information and database systems (2010) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5991, pp. 124-133. , Springer ch.

The analysis highlights a form of acyclicity in the interim belief structure of global games, which allows us to formalize a selection criterion, iterated generalized half-dominance. This criterion is shown to be a unique global game selection when noise distributions satisfy a regularity condition. A similar logic also applies to the perfect foresight dynamics of Matsui and Matsuyama (1995); an iterated generalized half-dominant equilibrium is a unique globally stable state when agents are patient enough. The criterion is especially useful for games with more than two asymmetric players, and can be easily applied to local interaction games with an arbitrary network structure. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Asymmetric games; Equilibrium selection; Global games; Networks; Perfect foresight dynamics",,,,,,"Angeletos, G.-M., Pavan, A., Selection-free predictions in global games with endogenous information and multiple equilibria (2013) Theor.

First, we derive an eight-step scenario approach and add the identification of emerging technologies as well as their respective effects on each scenario. Second, we illustrate this combined method in the field of personalized medicine (PM). Existing literature on method combination often focuses singular challenges and benefits associated with the scenario technique. In this paper, however, we integrate the results of a bibliometric analysis at each step of the scenario technique. Herein, we refer mainly to the co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling network. Third, we describe the findings of our case study for every step of the application of the scenario technique. In doing so, we offer practical guidelines for applying this novel combined method in other contexts. The overall benefit of the method combination is the integration of scientifically based information that exceeds the knowledge bases of the scenario team and other experts. Most notably, the examination of vast amounts of technology-specific information facilitates the identification of emerging technologies. Moreover, the combined method allows for a more precise projection of future states when narrowing the scenario funnel. Using this eight-step scenario approach, we build three scenarios for the field of PM, discuss disruptive events, and identify and integrate emerging technologies into each scenario. Finally, we explore strategic decisions for various stakeholders in the PM field. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Bibliometrics; Emerging technologies; Method combination; Personalized medicine; Scenario technique; Technology foresight","Information analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Bibliometrics; Emerging technologies; Method combination; Personalized medicines; Scenario technique; Technology foresight; Information science; knowledge; medicine; stakeholder; technological change",,,,,"Aboud, O.A., Weiss, R.H., New opportunities from the cancer metabolome (2013) Clin.

A leader who is not rooted in nature will practices a calculative type of thinking and leadership. Because the origin of such leadership is based on illusion, the destiny of such leadership is also projected towards an illusionary vista. Phenomenological logic influences our relationship to space, time, values, and perceptions. Humans are not the central lens epistemology that allows leaders to listen to the protesting environment that they are immersed in. This kind of deep ethics is possible only in the realm of Heidegger's meditative thinking, and it leads to longsighted and deeper answers for a sustainable world. Because humans have tried to make technology absolute, humans now live on products of technology instead of living in our natural habitat. Deep listening to the song of creation will make human beings more compassionate to the natural order and the foresight to fashion a symmetrical relationship with flora and fauna. © 2015 University of Phoenix.",,,,,,,"Heidegger, M., (1966) Discourse on thinking, , J.

Due to ongoing social change and the resulting changes in the requirements for democracy, the participative elements of democracy are constantly evolving. Consequently, in recent decades, the methods and instruments of public participation have developed and adapted to the changing demands in western democracies. Where, however, is public participation headed? This question remains unanswered, and the research at hand aims to answer it. To structure the current, at times controversial, discussion and gain insight into the future of public participation, we use a Delphi survey. Our survey focuses on expectations about the future of public participation using data from German administration professionals. The panelists evaluate 10 future projections on developments in public participation in Germany until the year 2020. Based on the obtained data, we identify the projections for which the panel agrees on the expected probability of occurrence. Moreover, we analyze the projections with dissent among the panelists in more detail and examine the evaluations for consensus within different subgroups. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi survey; E-participation; Futures studies; Public participation; Social change; Strategic foresight","Public policy; Surveys; Delphi surveys; E-participation; Futures studies; Public participation; Social changes; Strategic foresight; Public administration; administration; democracy; empirical analysis; future prospect; local participation; social change; strategic approach; Germany",,,,,"Abelson, J., Forest, P.-G., Eyles, J., Smith, P., Martin, E., Gauvin, F.-P., Deliberations about deliberative methods: issues in the design and evaluation of public participation processes (2003) Soc.

This paper aims at describing the long-run outcomes emerging from possible alternative growth strategies, differentiated between CEECs and EU15 countries, that had historically grown on the basis of two different development strategies. The analysis involves the development of scenarios over a time span of 18. years, from 2012, the latest year with actual data, up to 2030. Results show that the effects of Eastern countries' development strategies are highly influenced by the strategies chosen by the Western ones, while the opposite does not hold. Moreover, a scenario in which both groups of countries increase the quality of their original strategies, but remain in their actual productive specialization trajectories, is the least expansionary. In all cases, a strategy of modernization of CEECs economies leads to a more expansionary scenario; this strategy pays the most for Eastern countries if Western countries also move towards an industrial strategy. Finally, the most expansionary scenario is one of an advanced industrial Europe, and interestingly enough, this is also associated to lower increases in regional disparities. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Competitive strategies; Economic crisis; European regions; Globalization; Quantitative foresight; R11; R15; Regional growth","Industrial economics; Strategic planning; Competitive strategy; Economic crisis; European regions; Globalization; Quantitative foresight; R11; R15; Planning; competitiveness; development strategy; economic growth; financial crisis; globalization; regional development; Europe",,,,,"Affuso, A., Capello, R., Fratesi, U., Globalization and competitive strategies in European vulnerable regions (2011) Reg.

The study gives science-based insights for a future integrated estuarine water management in the Yangtze (Changjiang) Estuary. The hindsight focuses on the evolution and fate of riverine dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in the Yangtze Estuary from 1999 to 2010. A significant correlation between phosphorus and suspended particulate matter (SPM) was established. This shows that, in the past decade, the estuary has changed from being a source of DIP to being a sink, and from a heterotrophic system to an autotrophic system. The ecosystem shift may be explained by the combined impact of the construction of dams that retain SPM but not nutrients, and to increasing nutrient fluxes to the estuary due to increasing usage of fertilizer and sewage. The foresight study is based on likely future scenarios for 2050. These are estimated using historical data and the stratified and a muddy-LOICZ model, which takes stratification and adsorption-desorption of phosphorus into account. We forecast that in 2050 the effective DIP inflow into the Yangtze Estuary will increase by a factor of 1.5 if the SPM remains at the current annual average of 700mgL-1, and by a factor of 3.3 if the SPM decreases to 200mgL-1 as a result of the dams, which will further degrade the estuary. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autotrophy; Dams; Heterotrophy; Phosphorus; Suspended particulate matter; Yangtze Estuary (Changjiang)","adsorption; autotrophy; dam construction; dissolved inorganic matter; environmental degradation; environmental fate; estuarine environment; estuarine sediment; fluvial deposit; forecasting method; heterotrophy; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; pollutant source; sediment pollution; sediment trap; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; water management; China; Yangtze Estuary",,,,,"Anderson, M.D., Glibert, M.P., Burkholder, M.J., Harmful algal blooms and eutrophication: nutrient sources, composition, and consequences (2002) Estuaries, 25, pp. 704-726; Bricker, S.B., Clement, C.G., Pirhalla, D.E., Orlando, S.P., Farrow, D.R.G., (1999) National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment: Effects of Nutrient Enrichment in the Nation's Estuaries, pp. 1-71. , NOAA-NOS Special Projects Office; Chai, C., Yu, Z., Shen, Z., Song, X., Cao, X., Yao, Y., Nutrient characteristics in the Yangtze River Estuary and the adjacent East China Sea before and after impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (2009) Sci.

In this paper we summarize a brief history of nanoscience and nanotechnology by documenting the main milestones on the roadmap of this branch since the beginning of the twentieth century. We discuss the new properties of materials and structures appearing in the nanoworld that originate from both classical and quantum phenomena. We provide a critical analysis of inflated versus realistic expectations of the new technology. Attention is also paid to risks and regulations in the field, as well as codes of conduct of responsible nanoscientists and specific aspects of nanoethics that open a new chapter in ethical studies. The study elaborates on five foresight topics covering the building of structures atom-by-atom, the possibilities to close the appearing nano-divide, the future of silicon, single-particle devices, and sustainability in the field and single-particle devices. Among single particle devices the focus is on the transistors and sensors. We also highlight the role of social sciences and humanities in nanoscience and nanotechnology in the fields such as philosophy, psychology, security, the protection of privacy and intellectual property rights. Ethics is the main area of these activities. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.

But, these companies are not fully confident in budding LTE technology for M2M (Machine-To-Machine) applications, although it has been proved to be a promising technology for H2H (Human-To-Human) communications. LTE MTC (Machine Type Communications) is a part of the upcoming release 13 of the global 3GPP standard. The reliability, pervasiveneb, efficiency, and mature ecosystem of LTE make it the major candidate to support M2M applications in the future. However, in LTE MTC, power enhanced power modes are used to extend the battery life in the cost of increased latency. Since M2M requirements are more towards low throughput and low latency applications, it is necebary to investigate the performance of commercial LTE network in terms of latency. This paper presents the results of a latency measurement campaign done in commercial LTE networks in different coverage conditions. This paper is expected to provide utility companies a foresight about the feasibility of the public LTE networks to support delay sensitive applications. Moreover, necebary optimizations required from network operator side to support M2M applications are also discubed in this paper. © 2015 IEEE.","Companies; Delays; Downlink; Quality of service; Servers; Standards; Uplink","Electric power transmission networks; Industry; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Remote control; Servers; Standards; Communication infrastructure; Delay-sensitive applications; Delays; Downlink; Latency measurements; Machine to machines; Machine type communications; Uplink; Wireless telecommunication systems",,,,,"Fadlullah, Z., Fouda, M., Kato, N., Takeuchi, A., Iwasaki, N., Nozaki, Y., Toward intelligent machine-To-machine communications in smart grid (2011) Communications Magazine IEEE, 49 (4), pp. 60-65. , April; Johnson, P., Cutting the wires, 4G for the smart grid (2012) Land Mobile Article, , September; Bouallouche, D., (2012) Congestion Control in the Context of Machine Type Communication in Long Term Evolution Networks: A Dynamic Load Balancing Approach, , http://dumas.ccsd.cnrs.fr/dumas-00725217, Master's thesis, INRIA-IRISA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, équipe DIONYSOS, Jun.

Like no other mental faculty, it has been omnipotent in transforming human civilizations. Probing the neural basis of this most extraordinary capacity, however, has been doggedly frustrated. Despite a flurry of activity in cognitive neuroscience, recent reviews have shown that there is no coherent picture emerging from the neuroimaging work. Based on this, we take a different route and apply two well established paradigms to the problem. First is the evolutionary framework that, despite being part and parcel of creativity research, has no informed experimental work in cognitive neuroscience. Second is the emerging prediction framework that recognizes predictive representations as an integrating principle of all cognition. We show here how the prediction imperative revealingly synthesizes a host of new insights into the way brains process variation-selection thought trials and present a new neural mechanism for the partial sightedness in human creativity. Our ability to run offline simulations of expected future environments and action outcomes can account for some of the characteristic properties of cultural evolutionary algorithms running in brains, such as degrees of sightedness, the formation of scaffolds to jump over unviable intermediate forms, or how fitness criteria are set for a selection process that is necessarily hypothetical. Prospective processing in the brain also sheds light on how human creating and designing – as opposed to biological creativity – can be accompanied by intentions and foresight. This paper raises questions about the nature of creative thought that, as far as we know, have never been asked before. © 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Aha effect; Consciousness; Creativity; Emulation; Evolutionary algorithms; Fitness function; Heuristics; Idea; Insight; Prediction; Selection; Simulation","algorithm; behavior; brain; cognition; creativity; evolution; human; physiology; problem solving; thinking; Algorithms; Biological Evolution; Brain; Cognition; Creativity; Humans; Intention; Problem Solving; Thinking",,,,,"Abraham, A., The promises and perils of the neuroscience of creativity (2013) Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 7, 9p; Anderson, J.R., Lebiere, C.J., (1998) The Atomic Components of Thoughts, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ; Arden, R., Chavez, R.S., Grazioplene, R., Jung, R.E., Neuroimaging creativity: A psychometric view (2010) Behavioural Brain Research, 214, pp. 143-156. , PID: 20488210; Ashby, G.F., Casale, M.B., The cognitive neuroscience of implicit category learning (2002) Attention and Implicit Learning, pp. 109-141. , Jiménez L, (ed), John Benjamins Publishing Company, Amsterdam; Atance, C.M., O’Neill, D.K., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5, pp. 533-539. , PID: 11728911; Aziz-Zadeh, L., Liew, S.L., Exploring the neural correlates of visual creativity (2013) Social Cognitive and Affect Neuroscience, 8, pp. 475-480; Baars, B.J., (1988) A cognitive theory of consciousness, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Baker, S.C., Rogers, R.D., Owen, A.M., Frith, C.D., Dolan, R.J., Frackowiak, R.S.J., Robbins, T.W., Neural systems engaged in planning: A PET study of the Tower of London task (1996) Neuropsychologia, 34, pp. 515-526. , PID: 8736565; Bar, M., The proactive brain: Using analogies and associations to generate predictions (2007) Trends in Cognitive Science, 11, pp. 280-289; Bar, M., The proactive brain: Memory for prediction (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 364, pp. 1235-1243; Barsalou, L.W., Simulation, situated conceptualization, and prediction (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, B: Biological Sciences, 364, pp. 1281-1289; Blakemore, S.-J., Decety, J., From the perception of action to the understanding of intention (2001) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2, pp. 561-567. , PID: 11483999; Blakemore, S.J., Smith, J., Steel, R., Johnstone, E.C., Frith, C.D., The perception of self-produced sensory stimuli in patients with auditory hallucinations and passivity experiences: Evidence for a breakdown in self-monitoring (2000) Psychological Medicine, 30, pp. 1131-1139. , PID: 12027049; Bowers, K.S., Regehr, G., Balthazard, C.G., Parker, K., Intuition in the context of discovery (1990) Cognitive Psychology, 22, pp. 72-110; Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., (1985) Culture and the evolutionary process, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Bubic, A., Von Cramon, D.Y., Schubotz, R.I., Prediction, cognition and the brain (2010) Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, p. 4; Buckner, R.L., Carroll, D.C., Self-projection and the brain (2007) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, pp. 49-57. , PID: 17188554; Calvin, W.H., The brain as a darwinian machine (1987) Nature, 330, pp. 33-34; Calvin, W.H., Why a creative brain?

Three models are evaluated under perfect foresight and fixed horizon which is subsequently extended to explore the impact of a longer foresight on market revenues. The results show that comparatively, the balancing mechanism represents the highest source of potential revenues followed by the wholesale power market and Firm Frequency Response respectively. Longer horizons show diminishing returns, with the 1 day horizon providing the vast majority of total revenues. However storage power capacity utilization benefits from such long horizons. These results could imply that short horizons are very effective in capturing revenues in both the wholesale market and balancing mechanism whereas sizing of a storage system should take into consideration horizon foresight and accuracy for greater benefit. © 2015 IEEE.","Arbitrage Revenues; Electricity Market; Energy Storage; Optimization Horizon","Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Frequency response; Power markets; Ancillary service; Balancing mechanisms; Electricity storages; Market mechanisms; Perfect foresights; Potential revenue; Storage systems; Wholesale markets; Commerce",,,,,"Electricity Ten Year Statement | National Grid, , http://www2.nationalgrid.com/UK/Industryinformation/Future-of-Energy/Electricity-Ten-Year-Statement/, [Online].

Naturally, how we measure consensus is of great importance to science and technology strategic foresight. The Delphi methodology is a widely used anonymous survey technique to evaluate consensus among a panel of experts. Surprisingly, there is little guidance on how indices of consensus can be influenced by parameters of the Delphi survey itself. We simulated a classic three-round Delphi survey building on the concept of clustered consen-sus/dissensus. We evaluated three study characteristics that are pertinent for design of Delphi foresight research: (1) the number of survey questions, (2) the sample size, and (3) the extent to which experts conform to group opinion (the Group Conformity Index) in a Delphi study. Their impacts on the following nine Delphi consensus indices were then examined in 1000 simulations: Clustered Mode, Clustered Pairwise Agreement, Conger's Kappa, De Moivre index, Extremities Version of the Clustered Pairwise Agreement, Fleiss' Kappa, Mode, the Interquartile Range and Pairwise Agreement. The dependency of a consensus index on the Delphi survey characteristics was expressed from 0.000 (no dependency) to 1.000 (full dependency). The number of questions (range: 6 to 40) in a survey did not have a notable impact whereby the dependency values remained below 0.030. The variation in sample size (range: 6 to 50) displayed the top three impacts for the Interquartile Range, the Clustered Mode and the Mode (dependency = 0.396, 0.130, 0.116, respectively). The Group Conformity Index, a construct akin to measuring stubbornness/flexibility of experts' opinions, greatly impacted all nine Delphi consensus indices (dependency = 0.200 to 0.504), except the Extremity CPWA and the Interquartile Range that were impacted only beyond the first decimal point (dependency = 0.087 and 0.083, respectively). Scholars in technology design, foresight research and future(s) studies might consider these new findings in strategic planning of Delphi studies, for example, in rational choice of consensus indices and sample size, or accounting for confounding factors such as experts' variable degrees of conformity (stubbornness/flexibility) in modifying their opinions. © 2015 Birko et al.

Generically, the equilibria of an economy with price-contingent deliveries coincide with the equilibria of the corresponding economy with state-contingent deliveries. However, replacing state-contingent deliveries with price-contingent deliveries may generate additional equilibria and/or remove some equilibria.

Throwback branding is burgeoning. Newstalgia is the next big thing. Yet marketing thinking is dominated by the forward-facing discourse of innovation. The purpose of this paper is to challenge innovation’s rhetorical hegemony by making an exemplar-based case for renovation. Design/methodology/approach – If hindsight is the new foresight, then historical analyses can help us peer through a glass darkly into the future. This paper turns back time to the RMS Titanic, once regarded as the epitome of innovation, and offers a qualitative, narratological, culturally informed reading of a much-renovated brand. Findings – In narrative terms, Titanic is a house of many mansions. Cultural research reveals that renovation and innovation, far from being antithetical, are bound together in a deathless embrace, like steamship and iceberg. It shows that, although the luxury liner sank more than a century ago, Titanic is a billion-dollar brand and a testament to renovation’s place in marketing’s pantheon. It contends that the unfathomable mysteries of the Titanic provide an apt metaphor for back-to-the-future brand management. It is a ship-shape simile heading straight for the iceberg called innovation. Survival is unlikely but the collision is striking. Originality/value – This paper makes no claims to originality. On the contrary, it argues that originality is overrated. Renovation, rather, rules the waves. It is a time to renovate our thinking about innovation. The value of this paper inheres in that observation. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Metaphor; Mystery; Renovation; Retro-branding; RMS Titanic",,,,,,"Aaker, D., (2010) Building Strong Brands, , Pocket Books, New York, NY; Aboulnasr, K., Narasimhan, O., Blair, E., Chandy, R., Competitive response to radical product innovations (2008) Journal of Marketing, 72, pp. 94-110. , May; Ballard, R., (1995) The Discovery of the Titanic: Exploring the Greatest of all Lost Ships, , Orion, London; Bastos, W., Levy, S.J., A history of the concept of branding: Practice and theory (2012) Journal of Historical Research in Marketing, 4 (3), pp. 347-368; Baudrillard, J., (1994) The Illusion of the End, , (Trans by C.

Strategic foresight uses a variety of methods to assess possible future events. Combining different foresight methods and integrating expert opinions transform the strategic foresight process into a powerful but major undertaking. IT systems can assist with the growing complexity of strategic foresight methods. Currently, specialized IT systems can support various strategic foresight methods and foresight activities, but these are generally focused on isolated applications rather than providing a holistic solution.This article contributes to the field of foresight support systems by documenting and demonstrating the development and implementation of a foresight support system tailored for the German Federal Armed Forces. We draw on a literature-based design for foresight support systems and demonstrate how our system addresses issues raised in the literature. Our system provides a holistic approach to strategic foresight incorporating the rules of order in foresight processes, foresight method combinations, mechanisms for the reuse of foresight activity results, and collaborative decision-making. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight methods; Foresight process; Foresight support system; Software development; Web-based collaboration","Decision making; Social networking (online); Software engineering; World Wide Web; Collaborative decision making; Dynamic environments; Foresight methods; Holistic approach; Possible futures; Strategic foresight; Support systems; Web-based collaboration; Software design",,,,,"Rohrbeck, R., Schwarz, J.O., The value contribution of strategic foresight: Insights from an empirical study of large European companies (2013) Technol.

There is a growing interest in the design, accessibility, application and development of ICT-based systems for foresight processes by foresight practitioners and researchers alike. The foresight discipline applies more than 30 different techniques to obtain valid and profound conclusions about future developments and scenarios. Until now, only a fewof these techniques have been transferred into reliable software applications. However, this situation is changing quickly and many prototypes and ICT applications are being developed throughout theworld.Moreover, there has been a recent trend to develop even more complex software suites that embed and interlink multiple techniques. In order to respond to the dynamic progress in the field, we introduce this Special Issue on the future role of ICT in foresight.We selected nine informative articles that present the most recent research on foresight support systems, which form the basis for ongoing scientific debate in this new research stream. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"Application programs; Data; Decision; Foresight; Information; System; Software prototyping",,,,,"Banuls, V.A., Salmeron, J.L., Scope and design issues in foresight support systems (2011) Int.

We argue that engaging in foresight (1) enables clusters and organizations to face discontinuous change, (2) avoids lock-in of business clusters by networking and knowledge exploitation and that (3) collaborative foresight can support such networking. As systemic instruments that connect stakeholders and support continuous foresight processes, FSSs are especially suited to achieve these results. We present five basic premises to conceptualize an FSS and concretize them by a requirement analysis for an FSS funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the course of Germany's Leading-Edge Cluster Logistics. The requirements lead to the conceptualization of a foresight database, a digital future workshop application, and a prediction market application integrated in a futures platform. All applications are interlinked to support users through a guided, web-based, multi-method foresight process. The implementation of the FSS in business clusters and insights acquired during the three-year project are discussed. Overall, we present insights on how regionally implemented foresight contributes to regional innovation systems and thereby contribute to the emerging research stream on FSS. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cluster; Foresight support systems; Information technology; Prediction market; Regional innovation; Trend database","Commerce; Information technology; Social networking (online); Cluster; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Knowledge exploitation; Prediction markets; Regional innovation; Regional innovation systems; Requirement analysis; Support systems; Regional planning",,,,,"Porter, M.E., Clusters and the new economics of competition (1998) Harv.

These tools are integrated into an approach that encompasses the discovery of change, interpretation, and triggering managerial responses. The overall system consists of a tool for scanning for weak signals on change (PEACOQ Scouting Tool), a tool for collecting internal ideas (PEACOQ Gate 0.5), and a tool for triggering organizational responses (Foresight Landing page). Particularly the link to innovation management and R&D strategy is discussed in detail. We further report on the value creation and lessons learned that have accumulated over the last eight years throughout which the tools and approach have been built gradually. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate foresight; Innovation; IT tools; Scouting; Social networks; Web 2.0","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Corporate foresight; Deutsche telekom; Innovation management; Landing pages; Response systems; Scouting; Value creation; Web 2.0; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Vecchiato, R., Environmental uncertainty, foresight and strategic decision making: an integrated study (2012) Technol.

While the Delphi method has been a widely accepted foresight technique, prediction markets have been a very recent innovation to the existing decision and foresight support systems. Though, traditional prediction markets have been quite successful recently, our extension to the traditional prediction market methodology allows us to extract more valuable market information than any other prediction market since our approach provides not only a market forecast but also delivers an entire forecast distribution. The forecast distribution is generated by the aggregation of another unique characteristic of the suggested market structure namely that financial market professionals have to submit an interval forecast rather than point forecast. Based on our analysis, we demonstrate that our market is weak-form efficient and hence contains all publicly available information. In terms of forecasting accuracy, we conclude that the precision of our market improved over time and overall outperformed its benchmark. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Decision and foresight support system; Delphi method; Forecasting; Information integration; Prediction market","Commerce; Decision making; Financial markets; Internet; Social networking (online); Delphi method; Delphi methodology; Forecast distribution; Forecasting accuracy; Information integration; Interval forecasts; Prediction markets; Support systems; Forecasting",,,,,"Niiniluoto, I., Futures studies: science or art?

To date, relatively little attention has been given to how these approaches impact scenario planning and strategic foresight, especially in public projects designed to engage multiple stakeholders. This article explores the role that online approaches may play in qualitative scenario planning, using data from five empirical case studies. Two categories of measures were used to compare results between cases; participation characteristics, such as the number and type of participants involved, and interaction characteristics, such as the number of variables and opinions incorporated, the mechanisms of analysis, etc. The systems studied were found to have substantial impact on the early stages of the scenario process, in particular: increased participation in terms of both amount and diversity, increased volume and speed of data collected and analyzed, increased transparency around driver selection and analysis, and decreased overall cost of project administration. These results are discussed in the context of emerging issues and opportunities for scenario planning, particularly for public scenario projects, and how such tools and platforms might change scenario practice over time. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Crowdsourcing; Online participation; Public policy; Scenario planning; Strategic foresight","Innovation; Public policy; Technological forecasting; Crowdsourcing; Empirical case studies; Interaction characteristics; Methodological innovations; Multiple stakeholders; Online participation; Scenario Planning; Strategic foresight; Social networking (online)",,,,,"O'Rielly, T., What is Web 2.0?, , http://oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html, accessed online at:; Anderson, P., (2007) What is Web 2.0?

How might its supply and demand factors self-organize? In 2012 a real-time Delphi study, entitled, ""The Certification of Professional Futurists 2030,"" was conducted among 142 experts from 29 countries to debate the forces that might diminish or enhance futures work. The study consisted of 14 projections out to the year 2030, ranging from whether the global futures field might ""employ a viable form of certification for professional futurists,"" to whether it might ""share a common accepted understanding of futures assumptions, theory, methods, knowledge, and ethics."" Panelists identified themselves with various futures associations. This article presents the findings, including where there is dissent and consensus in the futures field over the likelihood, impact and desirability of the professionalization of its practice. Further scale development using factor analysis, ordered by the theory of competitive advantage, produced a scenario model of three market forces: assimilation, academicisation, or certification.

The simulation has been run for the first case study of Mobile Stroke Units (MSUs). In the highly time sensitive setting of acute stroke, MSUs are an innovative approach as they aim to reduce 'time-to-thrombolysis'.The ProHTA approach focuses on interdisciplinary work related to forecasting with hybrid simulation consisting of system dynamics models for macro-simulation and agent-based models for micro-simulation.Results of the simulation show that MSUs save up to 49. min of time between ambulance call and therapy decision. Whereas without MSUs, only 0.2% of patients fall in the group with the most favourable time interval between 0 and 90. min, up to 16.6% of patients treated in MSUs fall into this group of early onset times to thrombolysis. As a flexible and primarily quantitative decision-making tool for foresight, ProHTA adds value to existing methodologies for pre-assessing health technology at a very early stage of technology research and development. With its emphasis on strategic planning, ProHTA helps to improve the efficiency of health care delivery in different settings using hybrid simulation techniques. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Early technology assessment; Foresight; Health care; Medical device; Simulation; Stroke","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Decision making; Health care; Patient monitoring; Patient treatment; Technological forecasting; Foresight; Medical Devices; Simulation; Stroke; Technology assessments; Biomedical equipment",,,,,"(2010) Technology and Innovation Futures: UK Growth Opportunities for the 2020s, , Technology Annex, UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills; Barker, R., (2010) 2030: The Future of Medicine: Avoiding A Medical Meltdown, , Oxford University Press; David Stuckler, S.B., (2013) The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills Basic Books; Rowe, G., Wright, G., The Delphi technique: past, present, and future prospects-introduction to the special issue (2011) Technol.

The medical industry can utilize the rich, objective decision-making data contained within web forums through which participants who have common interests disseminate and receive information and form self-contained communities. We collect and analyze the contents of the web forum using Web, text, and data mining techniques. We identify the major needs of Alzheimer disease patients and their families. We also show how to track the time-series patterns of major topics providing insight to the medical industry. Furthermore, we study the dynamic mechanisms of major needs using the epidemic model and describe how users in a web forum collectively participate in topic discussions. Using the proposed model, the medical industry can predict the future market by estimating how long a topic will persist and how strongly a topic attracts attention. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Alzheimer's disease; Epidemic model; Foresight support system for medical industry; Informational/emotional support; Medical web forum","Data mining; Decision making; Epidemiology; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimer's disease; Dynamic mechanism; Epidemic modeling; Medical industries; Medical information; Time series patterns; Web forum analysis; Web Forums; Social networking (online)",,,,,"http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/Trend-Data-(Adults)/Whos-Online.aspx, Available at; Chaudhuri, A., Flamm, K.S., Horrigan, J., An analysis of the determinants of internet access (2005) Telecommun.

This paper will briefly discuss what collective intelligence is, why it is needed, some early approaches, how The Millennium Project (MP) is creating its own system - Global Futures Intelligence System (GFIS), and how MP is applying the elements of GFIS for the creation of ISIS (Integrated Synergistic Information System) for the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology.

Despite their popularity in IT for Foresight, a major obstacle is the complexity of strategic decisions and the resulting multitude of scenarios. Therefore choices need to be made, which scenarios to fully work out, by which experts and in which level of detail. This paper presents an approach to support making these trade-offs between accuracy and resources spent by prioritising scenarios based on their significance for the decision even on the basis of incomplete information. This approach combines theoretical findings in decision theory with results that were elicited in interviews and workshops with decision-makers and experts. In this manner, we ensure to adhere to time and effort constraints of the involved experts, while taking into account the decision-makers' preferences and requirements. The emergency management use-case shows that the resulting reduced set of scenarios leads to the same ranking of decision alternatives as the entire set of scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Complexity; Distributed scenario construction; Emergency management; Scenario prioritisation; Scenario relevance; Scenario similarity; Strategic decision making","Civil defense; Decision theory; Disasters; Economic and social effects; Risk management; Complexity; Emergency management; Scenario constructions; Scenario prioritisation; Scenario relevance; Scenario similarity; Strategic decision making; Decision making",,,,,"Fildes, R., Goodwin, P., Lawrence, M., The design features of forecasting support systems and their effectiveness (2006) Decis.

Faden & Beauchamp, 1986). Futures studies, while an eclectic multidisciplinary field, can reasonably be classified as primarily a social science and as such can involve human subjects in its research. Moreover much of the field is oriented toward applied, prescriptive pathways toward preferred futures that can involve influencing public policy and thus have significant social ramifications. This work investigates the extent to which futures studies research is involving human subjects, and, if so, whether informed consent practices are being applied to such futures studies research. The study proceeds to report the results of a poll of World Futures Studies Federation and Association of Professional Futurists members to gauge the nature of their research with emphasis on the use of human subjects and submission of proposed research to IRB evaluation. The piece concludes with a discussion on the expansion of the concept of informed consent to include engaging the public-at-large in the long-term effects of policy initiatives as a key element of the futures studies field and the representation of futures perspectives on institutional review boards particularly those involved in research on groups and communities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ethics; Foresight; Futures studies; Human subjects research; Informed consent; Interdisciplinary collaboration; Neuroscience; Public policy","ethics; future prospect; human behavior; interdisciplinary approach; policy analysis; research",,,,,"Special issue on neuroenhancement (2011) AJOB Neuroscience, 2 (4 OCTOBER); Anderson, J., Rainie, L., Gamification and the internet: Experts expect game layers to expand in the future, with positive and negative results (2012) Games for Health Journal, 1 (4), pp. 299-302; Anderson, M.A., Fitz, N., Howlader, D., 18 Neurotechnology research and the world stage (2012) Neurotechnology: Premises, Potential, and Problems, p. 287; Bell, S., Partridge, B., Lucke, J., Hall, W., Australian university students' attitudes towards the acceptability and regulation of pharmaceuticals to improve academic performance (2013) Neuroethics, 6 (1), pp. 197-205; Bell, W., Professional ethics for futurists: Preliminaries and proposals (1993) Futures Research Quarterly, 9 (1 SPRING 1993), pp. 5-18; Bell, W., Why should we care about future generations?

Policy makers and industrial communities use roadmapping methods to predict future industrial growth, but the existing bibliometric/workshop methods have limitations when analyzing the full-lifecycle industrial emergence, including the transitions between science, technology, application, and the mass market. This paper, therefore, proposes a framework that integrates bibliometrics and a technology roadmapping (TRM) workshop approach to strategize and plan the future development of the new, technology-based industry. The dye-sensitized solar cell technology-based industry in China is selected as a case study. In this case, the bibliometrics method is applied to analyze the existing position of science and technology, and TRM workshops are used to strategize the future development from technology to application and marketing. Key events and impact on the development of the new, technology-based industry have been identified. This paper will contribute to the roadmapping and foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic industry researchers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Bibliometrics; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Emerging industry; PV industry; Technology roadmap","Commerce; Information science; Photovoltaic cells; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Bibliometrics; Industrial communities; Industrial growth; Innovation activity; Science and Technology; Solar photovoltaics; Technology roadmapping; Technology roadmaps; Dye-sensitized solar cells",,,,,"(2013) A Report on the Development of Chinese Strategic Emerging Industries, , Chinese Institute for Engineering Development Strategies, Science China Press, Beijing, (Chinese); Huang, L., Zhang, Y., Guo, Y., Zhu, D., Porter, A.L., Four dimensional science and technology planning: a new approach based on bibliometrics and technology roadmapping (2014) Technol.

Biomass energy in Turkey is one of the most important renewable energy sources in terms of energy potential. Traditional biomass (wood and dung) in Turkey has a significant energy production rate. This ratio has been decreased with the decline of forests and the reduction seen in animal husbandry, recently. Traditional biomass is usually used in the form of non-commercial fuel and meets a quarter of the domestic energy production. Traditional biomass energy production has been planned 7530 Btep in 2020. In Turkey, the use of modern biomass energy is important in terms of the country's economy, and the environment pollution. Turkey has the potential to provide an alternative source of energy from the most appropriate and most cost-effective agricultural products according to its ecological conditions. Modern biomass started with 17 Btep in 2000. However, there has not been the foresight to future production. Whereas traditional biomass energy production should increasingly be reduced and modern biomass energy production should be increased. This situation will offer new investment fields to investors. This study shows that biomass energy continues to be the main source of energy for climate change mitigation and energy sustainability in Turkey, particularly in its traditional forms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, we apply Scenario Analysis in order to identify the barriers affecting the decision to invest in the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) sector in Morocco. Our results aim at facilitating the process of defining different paths in strategic political and policy actions. Using data from a survey on a panel of experts, the Cross Impact Analysis (CIA) and the Cross Impact Matrix System (SMIC) techniques are applied. The advantage of these techniques is that they allow including in the analysis the interlinkages between the events that will define the future scenarios. However, their limitation is that the number of events analyzed cannot be too high since the information collected from the experts increases exponentially according to the number of events introduced. We thus expand our analysis with a new methodological approach, combining the use of prospective and statistics techniques. This approach allows addressing the mentioned limitation and applying these techniques, initially restricted to 6 events in its common application, to a large number of events. The results show that uncertainty and informality would be key factors in promoting the arrival of companies in this sector. Additionally, regarding companies that already have a presence in Morocco's renewable energy sector, an increase in activity would be achieved through improvements in the easing of financial and legal barriers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cross Impact Analysis (CIA); CSP sector; Foreign investment barriers; Renewable energy; Scenarios design; SMIC technique","alternative energy; design; economic analysis; investment; renewable resource; solar power; Morocco",,,,,"Al-Saleh, Y., Renewable energy scenarios for major oil-producing nations: The case of Saudi Arabia (2009) Futures, 41 (9), pp. 650-662; Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, 46, pp. 23-40; Asan, U., Bozdag, C.E., Polat, S., A fuzzy approach to qualitative cross impact analysis (2004) Omega, 32 (6), pp. 443-458; Bañuls, V.A., Salmeron, J.L., Benchmarking the information society in the log range (2007) Futures, 39, pp. 83-95; Bañuls, V.A., Turoff, M., Scenario construction via Delphi and cross-impact analysis (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78, pp. 1579-1602; Blanning, R.W., Reinig, B.A., Cross-impact analysis using group decision support systems: An application to the future of Hong Kong (1999) Futures, 31, pp. 39-56; Bosetti, V., Catenacci, M., Fiorese, G., Verdolini, E., The future prospect of PV and CSP solar technologies: An expert elicitation survey (2012) Energy Policy, 49, pp. 308-317; Bürer, M.J., Wüstenhagen, R., Which renewable energy policy is a venture capitalist's best friend?

Through quantitative and qualitative methods, the study identifies a list of 24 relevant technologies in mechatronics, which has been chose for its relevance in the regional economy that is addressed by the present study. The prioritization of these technologies is based on both the attractiveness index and dynamism index. The attractiveness index is calculated by a triangulation of data (patent and patent citations, EU's 7° framework, venture capitalists' investments, and interviews) collected through multiple databases. The dynamism index measures the increase of patent intensity through time. A ranking of 24 technologies is identified according to these two indexes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

In the presence of demand learning, the firm needs to make a decision, whether to actively learn the market through a greater initial investment in the AFS network or defer the commitment since an overly-aggressive investment often results in sub-optimal AFS locations. To illustrate this trade-off, we introduce a two-stage location model, in which the service provider enters the market by deploying a set of stations in the first stage under uncertainty, and has the option to add more stations in the second stage after it learns the demand. The demand learning time (length of the first stage) is endogenously determined by the service provider’s action in the first stage. To solve this problem, we develop an efficient solution method that provides a framework to achieve a desired error rate of accuracy in the optimal solution. Using numerical experiment, we study the trade-off between active learning and deferred commitment in AFS deployment strategy under different market characteristics. Further, we find that the lack of planning foresight typically results in an over-commitment in facility investment while the service provider earns a lower expected profit. © 2014, US Government.","Alternative fuel station operations; Demand learning; Facility location; Maximal covering problem",,,,,,"Ballou, R.H., Dynamic warehouse location analysis (1968) Journal of Marketing Research, 5 (3), pp. 271-276; Baron, O., Milner, J., Naseraldin, H., Facility location: a robust optimization approach (2010) Production and Operations Management, 20 (5), pp. 772-785; Berman, O., Drezner, Z., The p-median problem under uncertainty (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 189 (1), pp. 19-30; Berman, O., Krass, D., The generalized maximal covering location problem (2002) Computers & Operations Research, 29 (6), pp. 563-581; Berman, O., Krass, D., Drezner, Z., The gradual covering decay location problem on a network (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 151 (3), pp. 474-480; Campbell, J., Locating transportation terminals to serve an expanding demand (1990) Transportation Research.

The age of the participants in these large prospective cohorts is still prohibitive in that researchers can only consider pre-clinical markers of CV pathology. Despite this, cohorts from multiple countries have reported consistent findings concerning the adverse CV impact childhood passive smoking exposure is having decades later. Fortunately, we now have sufficient evidence as to the exact mechanisms through which tobacco smoke causes CVD. With a large proportion of the world’s children exposed to passive smoking daily, especially in the as-yet unstudied developing world, but with very few living in jurisdictions with effective and enforced protective legislation, the time for public health action is now. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular; Cardiovascular disease; Childhood; Environmental tobacco smoke; Passive smoking; Pediatric; Review","cotinine; tobacco smoke; arterial stiffness; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; cardiovascular disease; child; child parent relation; endothelial dysfunction; environmental impact assessment; human; inflammation; law; passive smoking; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; public health; questionnaire; Review; risk factor; smoking habit",,"cotinine, 486-56-6",,,"Schonherr, E., Contribution to the statistical and clinical features of lung tumours (in German) (1928) Z Krebsforsch, 27, pp. 436-450; English, J.P., Willius, F.A., Berkson, J., Tobacco and coronary disease (1940) JAMA, 115, pp. 1327-1329. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaH3MXhtVG; Smoking NRCUCoP.

The discussion on the theory of foresight calls for a theory, but rarely expounds on what the scope of theorizing is. The discussion has been centered on philosophy and different frameworks for theorizing, but the scope and form of theorizing have not been explored. We contribute to this discussion by examining foresight through the lens of established theory building literature to map what constitutes a theory in the first place and how it applies in foresight. The main guiding question is ""What does a theory of foresight mean?"". We fist draw on the literature on theory development in social sciences to discuss a framework for theorizing and then examine the scope of theorizing through it. Our main argument is that when we propose developing (a) theory of foresight, we need to separate three levels of analysis: one is foresight as knowledge creating activity, second is foresight as a process and as a social/organizational intervention, and foresight as theorizing about the future of a given socio-technical system. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Epistemology; Foresight; Theorizing; Theory development","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Epistemology; Foresight; Levels of analysis; Sociotechnical systems; Theorizing; Theory building; Theory development; Through the lens; Algorithms; knowledge; philosophy; theoretical study",,,,,"Abbott, A., (2001) Chaos of Disciplines, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Ahlqvist, T., Halonen, M., Eerola, A., Kivisaari, S., Kohl, J., Koivisto, R., Myllyoja, J., Wessberg, N., Systemic transformation, anticipatory culture, and knowledge spaces: constructing organisational capacities in roadmapping projects at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland (2012) Tech.

The aims of this study were to apply the concept of resilience to the mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which we call ""parenting resilience"" for rearing a child with ASD, and to explain the construct of parenting resilience. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 23 mothers of adults with ASD to collect data on rearing these children from infancy to adulthood. Data were analyzed using a modified grounded-theory approach. Results: The analytic theme was the thought process from the problems associated with raising developmentally challenged children to the implementation of the appropriate coping method. We proposed a model comprising twelve concepts and five categories, i. e., ""a sense of motherhood"", ""self-efficacy"", ""knowledge of the child's characteristics"", ""perceived social support"", and ""foresight"". The model assumes that a sense of motherhood and self-efficacy motivate these mothers to cope with the problems associated with developmentally challenged children, and they derive the way of dealing with it from knowledge of the child's characteristics, perceived social support, and foresight. Discussion: We suggest that the construct of parenting resilience for rearing a child with ASD is composed of the proposed categories and concepts.",,"Article; autism; child; child parent relation; child rearing; clinical article; clinical feature; coping behavior; female; grounded theory; human; maternal care; parenting resilience; qualitative research; self concept; social support; adolescent; adult; aged; child parent relation; ethics; male; middle aged; mother; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Autistic Disorder; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mothers; Parenting; Resilience, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,"Koegel, R.L., Schreibman, L., Loos, L.M., Consistent stress profiles in mothers of children with autism (1992) J Autism Dev Disord, 22, pp. 205-216; Breen, M.J., Barkley, R.A., Child psychopathology and parenting stress in girls and boys having attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (1988) J Pediatr Psychol, 13, pp. 265-280; Lovejoy, M.C., Graczyk, P.A., O'Hare, E., Neuman, G., Maternal depression and parenting behavior:A meta-analytic review (2000) Clin Psychol Rev, 20, pp. 561-592; Maccoby, E.E., Parenting and its effects on children: On reading and misreading behavior genetics (2000) Annu Rev Psychol, 51, pp. 1-27; Luthar, S.S., Cicchetti, D., Becker, B., The construct of resiliences critical evaluation and guidelines for future work (2000) Child Dev, 71, pp. 543-562; Werner, E.E., High-risk children in young adulthood: A longitudinal study from birth to 32 years (1989) Am J Orthopsychiatry, 59, pp. 72-81; Walsh, F., The concept of family resilience: Crisis and challenge (1996) Fam Process, 35, pp. 261-281; Hawley, D.R., DeHaan, L., Toward a definition of family resilience: Integrating life-span and family perspectives (1996) Fam Process, 35, pp. 283-298; Bayat, M., Evidence of resilience in families of children with autism (2007) J Intellect Disabil Res, 51, pp. 702-714; Hastings, R.P., Child behaviour problems and partner mental health as correlates of stress in mothers and fathers of children with autism (2003) J Intellect Disabil Res, 47, pp. 231-237; Suzuki, K., Kobayashi, T., Moriyama, K., Kaga, M., Inagaki, M., A framework for resilience research in parents of children with developmental disorders (2013) Asian Journal of Hitman Services, 5, pp. 104-111; Eriksson, E., Lauri, S., Informational and emotional support for cancer patients' relatives (2000) Eur J Cancer Care (Engl), 9, pp. 8-15; Olshansky, S., Chronic sorrow: A response to having a mentally defective child (1962) Social Casework, 43, pp. 190-193",,,,"Japanese Society of Child Neurology",,,,,00290831,,NTHAA,"26353450","Japanese","No To Hattatsu",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938070687

The proposed model simulates the generation investment decisions taken by a particular agent (i.e. a generating company) in a market environment taking into account its competitors’ strategic investment. The investment decision of a particular company is modeled taking into account that such company has imperfect foresight on the future system development hence electricity prices. The delay in the construction of new plants is also explicitly modeled, in order to compute accurately the yearly revenues of each agent. On top of a conventional energy market, several capacity incentive mechanisms including capacity payment and capacity market are simulated, so as to assess their impact on the investment promotion for generation expansion. Results provide insight on the investment cycles as well as dynamic system behavior of long-term generation expansion planning in a competitive electricity industry. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","Agent-based modeling;

Contextual intelligence is described as the ability to recognize patterns of interrelated artifacts inherent in events or circumstances, which result in intentional behaviors that facilitate influence. This chapter is divided into sections that introduce the concept of contextual intelligence as a framework rooted in three core concepts. Those concepts include understanding non- Newtonian thinking, synchronicity, and tacit knowledge. Following a discussion of these core concepts, the model is expanded to include three-dimensional (3D) thinking, which requires the practical application of hindsight, insight, and foresight through the lenses of the three core concepts. The chapter concludes with a diagram of the contextual intelligence circumplex and a breakdown and description of 12 meta-competencies (behaviors) associated with contextual intelligence. © 2015, IGI Global.

Huntsman Hall, Philadelphia, PA  19104, United States","Using exploratory factor analysis on a unique dataset of global executives, we find that their perceptions of their national government’s risk management effectiveness are largely driven by two latent factors: leadership virtue, and governance. We show that the leadership virtue signal is potentially a stronger signal (3.19 times more correlated with risk management perceptions than the governance indicator). We hypothesize that this may be because making decisions and taking actions to manage risk is a continuous process requiring inter alia foresight and moral discipline in looking to the interests of others and acting in service to those interests above self-interest. This suggests at least two propositions for further testing, for which, we offer rhetorical argument and anecdotal evidence at the end of this paper and suggest methodologies for further testing. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to uncover this connection empirically between national risk management and leadership virtue. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ethics; Governance; Leadership; Risk management",,,,,,"Aguilera, R.V., Cuervo-Cazurra, A., Codes of good governance (2009) Corporate Governance: An International Review, 17 (3), pp. 376-387; Almquist, R., Grossi, G., van Helden, G.J., (2012) & Reichard, C, , Public sector governance and accountability, Critical Perspectives on Accounting; Argyriades, D., Good governance, professionalism, ethics and responsibility (2006) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 72 (2), pp. 155-170; Besancon, M., Good governance rankings: The art of measurement (Vol (2003) 36), , Cambridge: World Peace Foundation; http://jalt.org/test/PDF/Brown31.pdf, Brown, J.

What lies beneath the spate of recent RIS3s, in terms of specialization options as well as of the processes through which the latter were reached, is only now beginning to be examined in depth. Notably, the Commission did not offer a proper blueprint for RIS3-making, but opted instead to suggest a wide range of possible instruments.

After the crisis of late 1990s, the government declared science and technology (S&T) as one of national priorities and started increasingly investing in this sector but it has not led to the tangible output like a bigger volume of high-tech exports or a higher share of international publications. A number of policy instruments have been introduced to increase the efficiency of STI policies. One of them is S&T Foresight. The activities aimed at identification of national S&T priorities and series of Foresight studies have helped to understand which areas are most promising for sustaining existing competitive advantages and building new ones via gradual shift from the resource-based economy towards the technology-oriented one. The paper presents the design and organisation of a large-scale Russian S&T Foresight exercise as a fully-fledged instrument of the national STI policy and discusses the achieved results and their use for policies at different levels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Foresight methodology; Priority research areas; Science and technology Foresight; Science, technology and innovation policy","future prospect; government; innovation; market transition; research and development; science and technology; technology policy; Russian Federation",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Grand challenges—a new framework for Foresight evaluation (2011) EU-SPRI Conference Papers, Manchester, 20–22 September; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Apokin, A., Belousov, D., Scenarios of the global and Russian economic development as a basis for S&T forecasting (2009) Foresight-Russia, 3, pp. 12-29; Cagnin, C., STI Foresight in Brazil (2014) Foresight-Russia, 8 (2), pp. 46-55; Cagnin, C., Amanatidou, E., Keenan, M., Orienting European innovation systems towards grand challenges and the roles that FTA can play (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39 (2), pp. 140-152; Calof, J.L., Competitive intelligence and the management accountability framework.

Water safety testing for pathogens currently depends on surrogate measures such as fecal indicator bacteria (e.g., E. coli). Metagenomics concerns high-throughput, culture-independent, unbiased shotgun sequencing of DNA from environmental samples that might transform water safety by detecting waterborne pathogens directly instead of their surrogates. Yet emerging innovations such as metagenomics are often fiercely contested. Innovations are subject to shaping/construction not only by technology but also social systems/values in which they are embedded, such as experts' attitudes towards new scientific evidence. We conducted a classic three-round Delphi survey, comprised of 107 questions. A multidisciplinary expert panel (n = 24) representing the continuum of discovery scientists and policymakers evaluated the emergence of metagenomics tests. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first Delphi foresight study of experts' attitudes on (1) the top 10 priority evidentiary criteria for adoption of metagenomics tests for water safety, (2) the specific issues critical to governance of metagenomics innovation trajectory where there is consensus or dissensus among experts, (3) the anticipated time lapse from discovery to practice of metagenomics tests, and (4) the role and timing of public engagement in development of metagenomics tests. The ability of a test to distinguish between harmful and benign waterborne organisms, analytical/clinical sensitivity, and reproducibility were the top three evidentiary criteria for adoption of metagenomics. Experts agree that metagenomic testing will provide novel information but there is dissensus on whether metagenomics will replace the current water safety testing methods or impact the public health end points (e.g., reduction in boil water advisories). Interestingly, experts view the publics relevant in a ""downstream capacity"" for adoption of metagenomics rather than a co-productionist role at the ""upstream"" scientific design stage of metagenomics tests. In summary, these findings offer strategic foresight to govern metagenomics innovations symmetrically: by identifying areas where acceleration (e.g., consensus areas) and deceleration/reconsideration (e.g., dissensus areas) of the innovation trajectory might be warranted. Additionally, we show how scientific evidence is subject to potential social construction by experts' value systems and the need for greater upstream public engagement on metagenomics innovations. © 2015 Birko et al.",,"water; water pollutant; adult; Article; controlled study; Delphi study; female; human; legal evidence; male; medical expert; metagenomics; participatory management; safety; water safety; analysis; bacterium; classification; genetics; health promotion; middle aged; procedures; standards; water pollutant; water quality; water supply; Adult; Bacteria; Delphi Technique; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Metagenomics; Middle Aged; Water Pollutants; Water Quality; Water Supply",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water Pollutants",,,"Qu, X., Brame, J., Li, Q., Alvarez, P.J., Nanotechnology for a safe and sustainable water supply: Enabling integrated water treatment and reuse (2013) Acc Chem Res, 46, pp. 834-843. , PMID: 22738389; Grantham, T.E., Merenlender, A.M., Resh, V.H., Climatic influences and anthropogenic stressors: An integrated framework for streamflow management in Mediterranean-climate California, U.S.A.

However, the cause of delirium is unknown. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess brain tissue oxygenation in patients with septic shock, who are at high risk of developing delirium. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in a 33-bed general medical surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were eligible for recruitment. The FORESIGHT NIRS monitor was used to assess brain tissue oxygenation in the frontal lobes for the first 72 hours of ICU admission. Physiological data was also recorded. We used the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU to screen for delirium. Results: From March 1st 2014-September 30th 2014, 10 patients with septic shock were recruited. The NIRS monitor captured 81% of the available data. No adverse events were recorded. Brain tissue oxygenation demonstrated significant intra- and inter-individual variability in the way it correlated with physiological parameters, such as mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation. Mean brain tissue oxygen levels were significantly lower in patients who were delirious for the majority of their ICU stay. Conclusion: It is feasible to record brain tissue oxygenation with NIRS in patients with septic shock. This study provides the infrastructure necessary for a larger prospective observational study to further examine the relationship between brain tissue oxygenation, physiological parameters, and acute neurological dysfunction.

The key task of the present article is to develop the concept of ensuring the enterprise competitiveness through the use of Neo-Schumpeterian Knowledge Funnel and foresight project development of the future of the enterprises, taking into account global unchanging sociopolitical, economic and technological trends. During the presentation of the work, the following conclusions were obtained: • Ability of enterprises to compete in the market depends on a number of factors and conditions; the unique (hardly copyable or uncopyable) competitive advantages/core competencies play a major role in ensuring the competitiveness of enterprises. The accumulation of the knowledge capacity of the enterprise development promotes their innovative activity, i.e. ability to create and offer high-tech products (goods, works, services) to the market; • Competitive potential of enterprises based on knowledge is implemented due to the use of a funnel of emerging opportunities – the neo-Schumpeterian funnel. This funnel allows converting the potential Thus, we believe that foresight project planning is a reasonably optimal and at the same time effective tool for the active design of the future of firms in order to form strategic competitiveness in the long term. Methodical and methodological approaches of innovative foresight as a variety of management tools are aimed at solving the fundamental problem, which we define as the search for and identification of the most promising long-term trends in the sociopolitical and economical and technological aspects that will determine the overall business environment and probabilistic approaches to ensure and enhance the strategic competitiveness of business structures. This tool allows to not only actively design the future of firms already at the present stage of development, but also to transform the vector of development, taking into account possible changes in the longterm environmental trends. This article has briefly discussed the theoretical and methodological aspects of ensuring the competitiveness of firms in modern conditions, including through the use of foresight project planning, and the role of cognitive (knowledge) resources in the formation of competitive advantage of firms was justified. Limited scope of the study does not allow to adequately and at the same time meaningfully reveal the essence of the use of foresight technology to ensure a competitive and sustainable development of firms; these aspects will be presented in our further work. © 2015, ASERS Publishing House.

However, often these studies overlook the soft factor of employee competences which is critical to adopting technological and organizational changes and to developing the necessary innovation capabilities. This study investigates the theoretical and methodological underdeveloped relationship between technological innovation and social initiated change and the impact on individual competences in a dynamic sector. The setting of our study is the turbulent creative industries as a whole, where creative and artistic expression merges with changing technological progress. In a scenario study we mainly conducted in 2010, we developed a scenario model for competences to combine individual competences with a scenario approach to investigate how competences are important to the sector shift or need to be enhanced in the future. We use primary qualitative data from expert interviews and workshops and secondary data from industry reports to identify thirty-seven influence factors. An influence matrix calculation and a cluster analysis are used to project three different scenarios presenting how future developments of the creative industries will influence the competences needed for creative occupations. Now, five years later, we reflect the accuracy of the developed scenarios via a comparison of today's situation with the situation in the scenarios. We discuss theoretical contributions for the foresight literature and practical implementations for the future of work in general, and in particular for the creative industries case. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Competences; Convergence; Creative economy; Creative industries; Digital; Entertainment; Foresight; Futures studies; Human capital resource; Media; Microfoundations; Scenario; Skills; Strategic human resources; Technological impact; Work","Technological forecasting; Competences; Convergence; Creative economy; Creative industries; Digital; Entertainment; Foresight; Futures studies; Human capital resources; Media; Micro-foundations; Scenario; Skills; Strategic human resources; Technological impact; Work; Cluster analysis",,,,,"Albarran, A.B., Media economics (2004) The Sage Handbook of Media Studies, pp. 291-307. , SAGE, Thousand Oaks London Neu Delhi, J.

Over three days, and in nine different workshops, participants created games, products, monuments, images and stories in an effort to reveal the texture and feel of emergent futures. The Emerge workshops drew from a burgeoning field of future-oriented methods that infuse art, design and information technology into the development and delivery of scenarios and design fictions - a constellation of practices I call ""mediated scenarios"". This introduction and the articles in this special issue, work to make sense of these emerging practices, and of Emerge itself, in order to develop appreciation of this rising genre. In doing so, the papers in this issue ask critical questions about the nature of these novel forms of foresight practice and investigate the trade-offs and potencies involved in the workings of mediated scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Art/science; Design fiction; Scenarios",,,,,,"Allenby, B.R., Sarewitz, D., (2011) The techno-human condition, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Anand, J., Cardenas, F.E., Wiesinger, N., Cavanaugh, D., (2012) Ear to the ground, , http://vimeo.com/38168393, Retrieved from; Barben, D., Fisher, E., Selin, C., Guston, D.H., Anticipatory governance of nanotechnology: Foresight, engagement, and integration (2008) The handbook of science and technology studies, pp. 979-1000. , The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, E.J.

Besides, we cannot stop our fight against smoking, which remains the leading cause of preventable illness and death in Chile and the world.

This article draws from selected Futures Studies to identify global trends and discontinuities in these trends that could affect rural areas in contrasting ways. These drivers are combined to explore plausible rural transformations, focusing on two major dimensions. One is rooted in societal values and worldviews about the rural world. The other is rooted in consumers’ preferences and how they link to production systems. As a result, seven plausible transformations are identified and discussed. Some of them are already happening, others are in an embryonic stage in various places. Some are desirable, others are not. They call for societal choices and immediate action if the future of rural areas is to be the future we want for them. © 2017 Society for International Development.","Agriculture; Disruptions; Foresight; Rural development; Trends",,,,,,"Alcatel-Lucent, (2012) Megatrends: A Wave of Change Impacting the Future, , Paris: Alcatel-Lucent; Bourgeois, R., Ekboir, J., Sette, C., Egal, C., Wongtschowski, M., Baltissen, G., (2012) The State of Foresight in Food and Agriculture and the Roads Toward Improvement: Part 1-Foresight Report to GCARD II, , http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//305471/State_of_foresight_Report.pdf; Brousseau, E., Glachant, J.-M., (2014) The Manufacturing of Markets: Legal, Political and Economic Dynamics, , (eds.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Brutel, C., Le nouveau zonage en bassins de vie de 2012: Trois quarts des bassins de vie sont ruraux (2012) INSEE Première, (1425). , http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1425; Busch, L., Bain, C., New!

The intersection of design and futures produces artifacts, applications and interactions created to provoke dialog in an accessible manner. As part of the Futures special issue on the Emerge: Artists and Scientists Redesign the Future event, this article describes the documentation and public representation of the creative outcomes from nine Emerge design futures workshops. These workshops provided a rich opportunity to study how designers and futurists collaboratively engage, implement and communicate alternative futures.

Scholars examining this trend tend to diagnose it at once as techno positivist in its insistence on design yoked to quantifiable variables and computational modeling and, alternatively, as an imperative integral to realizing ecologically sustainable innovation. This article investigates this tension. It reflects on the role of futurists, designers, architects, urban planners, social scientists, and artists in interpreting and utilizing comprehensiveness as a design frame. Among nine experimental foresight workshops at the inaugural Emerge conference at Arizona State University, many focused on producing physical objects or media, one modeled and expanded upon a method pioneered by architect and polymath R. Buckminster Fuller. At a time when many of the capabilities to realize Fuller's specifications for big data have matured, I investigate whether comprehensive design as framed by Fuller's method shows promise as a trend enabling ecologically sustainable innovations. A historical look at Fuller's Design Science and the reflection on it in the Emerge workshop marks an opportunity to highlight and interpret the resurgence of comprehensive thinking in design while navigating the contradictions this orientation engenders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Big data; Buckminster Fuller; Comprehensiveness; Design science; Worldviews Network","decision making; design; innovation; modeling; policy approach",,,,,"Bloomfield, B.P., (1986) Modeling the world: The social constructions of systems analysts, , Blackwell, Oxford [Oxfordshire]/New York, NY, USA; Brown, C.S., (2007) Big history: From the big bang to the present, , New Press, New York; Brown, H., Cook, R., Gabel, M., (1975) Environmental design science primer, , https://bfi.org/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/EnvDesignPrimer-BrownCookGabel.pdf, Advocate Press, New Haven, Connecticut (November 1, 2014); Brown, N., Immortality by design (2008) Parallax, 14 (3), pp. 4-20; Carter Emmart Demos a 3D Atlas of the Universe|Video on TED.com (2013), http://www.ted.com/talks/carter_emmart_demos_a_3d_atlas_of_the_universe.html, April 14; (2013) A second modernism: MIT, architecture, and the 'techno-social' moment, , SA+Press, Department of Architecture, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, A.

The need of such a system has been accelerated by the ever-increasing competition to out-perform the market in an environment contaminated by fear from the trailing crisis and anxiety about the future sustainability. The authors engineered a multi-resolution convergence divergence indicator inthe light of multi frequency trading behaviour of the heterogeneous agents and used the same in a recurrent neural network based non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input model to conditionally predict the future movements. The predictions aresubsequently used in a flexible asset allocation system to manage dynamically both the exposure to the risky asset and the degree of risk tolerance. To ascertain the reliability of the model an out-of-the sample validation test is conducted and the model iscompared with its peer and the market by back-testing the same on the testing data set. A multitude of relevant risk and performance measures are used for evaluating the proposed model. The outcome of the study reveals that the proposed system outperforms its peer and the market by a reasonable margin. © 2015, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.","Back testing; Flexible asset allocation; Neural network prediction; Portfolio insurance; Wavelets",,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Vrat, P., Bio inspired managerial insights for a flexible and efficient organization: A SAP–LAP analysis (2014) Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management, 15 (4), pp. 345-361; Aloui, R., Aïssa, M.S.B., Nguyen, D.K., Global financial crisis, extreme interdependences, and contagion effects: The role of economic structure?

Economists are under fire, but questions concerning exactly how to redeem the discipline remain unanswered. In this provocative book, renowned economist Meghnad Desai investigates the evolution of economics and maps its trajectory against the occurrence of major political events to provide a definitive answer. Desai underscores the contribution of hubris to economists' calamitous lack of foresight, and he makes a persuasive case for the profession to re-engage with the history of economic thought. He dismisses the notion that one over-arching paradigm can resolve all economic eventualities while urging that an array of already-available theories and approaches be considered anew for the insights they may provide toward preventing future economic catastrophes. With an accessible style and keen common sense, Desai offers a fresh perspective on some of the most important economic issues of our time. © 2015 Meghnad Desai.

Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual review of the literature on scenario planning in SMEs intended to unpack and capture the possible underlying reasons accounting for the limited uptake of scenario planning by managers/owners of SMEs has informed the formulation of this paper. Findings – The study uncovered that SMEs’ managerial mental models, SMEs’ managerial time orientation, severe resource constraints, and industry complexity are some of the salient factors inhibiting the use of scenario planning among managers/owners of SMEs. The author develops a framework of propositions that account for the complexity and challenges of scenario planning by SMEs for future empirical examination and validation. Originality/value – The conventional wisdom is that scenario planning is carried out by large and established firms, and that SMEs are unable to adopt and practice the technique. This paper uncovers that SME have substantial needs for scenario planning, but are only able to engage in simple foresight activities such as brainstorming, desk research, networking and expert interviews to monitor their external environment. They are unable to effectively use scenario planning in its purest form as in large firms. By bringing together the reasons accounting for the difficulty of SMEs to practice scenario planning in its purest form as large firms do, the study therefore extends the limited discourse on scenario planning among SMEs. Implications are discussed and areas for future empirical studies provided. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Industry complexity; Managerial orientation; Organizational learning; Scenario planning; Small and medium size enterprises (SMEs)",,,,,,"Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, 46 (February), pp. 1-62; Amsteus, M., Managerial foresight: concept and measurement (2008) Foresight, 10 (1), pp. 53-66; Amsteus, M., Managerial foresight: measurement scale and estimation (2011) Foresight, 13 (1), pp. 58-76; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Bianchi, C., Introducing SD modelling into planning and control systems to manage SMEs’ growth: a learning-oriented perspective (2002) System Dynamics Review, 18 (3), pp. 315-338; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: an overview of techniques (2007) Foresight – The Journal of Future Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Bogner, W.C., Barr, P.S., Making sense in hypercompetitive environments: a cognitive explanation for the persistence of high velocity competition (2000) Organization Science, 11 (2), pp. 212-226; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., van der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Burmeister, K., Neef, A., Beyers, B., (2004) Corporate Foresight, , Murmann Verlag DE, Essen; Burt, G., van der Heijden, K., First steps: towards purposeful activities in scenario thinking and future studies (2003) Futures, 35 (10), pp. 1011-1026; Calkins, M., Berman, S.L., Special issue: business ethics in global economy (2004) Business Ethics Quarterly, 14 (4), pp. 597-601; Chermack, T.J., Improving decision-making with scenario planning (2004) Futures, 36 (3), pp. 295-309; Chermack, T.J., Studying scenario planning: theory, research suggestions, and hypotheses (2005) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 72 (1), pp. 59-73; Chermack, T.J., Lynham, S.A., Ruona, W.E., A review of scenario planning literature (2001) Futures Research Quarterly, 17 (2), pp. 7-32; Chermack, T.J., Lynham, S.A., van der Merwe, L., Exploring the relationship between scenario planning and perceptions of learning organization characteristics (2006) Futures, 38 (7), pp. 767-777; Cummings, T.G., Worley, C.G., (2001) Organization Development and Change, , South-Western College Publishing, Cincinnati, OH; Cunha, M.P., Palma, P., da Costa, N.G., Fear of foresight: knowledge and ignorance in organizational foresight (2006) Futures, 38 (8), pp. 942-955; Curry, A., From foresight to insight: using scenarios well (2009) Journal of Futures Studies, 13 (3), pp. 119-122; De Geus, A.P., Planning as learning (1988) Harvard Business Review, 66 (2), pp. 70-74; Demirbag, M., Tatoglu, E., Tekinkus, M., Zaim, S., An analysis of the relationship between TQM implementation and organizational performance: evidence from Turkish SMEs (2006) Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 17 (6), pp. 829-847; Franco, L.A., Meadows, M., Armstrong, S.J., Exploring individual differences in scenario planning workshops: a cognitive style framework (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80 (4), pp. 723-734; Fuller, T., Warren, L., Entrepreneurship as foresight: a complex social network perspective on organisational foresight (2006) Futures, 38 (8), pp. 956-971; Gilmore, A., Carson, D., Grant, K., SME marketing in practice (2001) Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 19 (1), pp. 6-11; Godet, M., The art of scenarios and strategic planning: tools and pitfalls (2000) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 65 (1), pp. 3-22; Godet, M., Roubelat, F., Creating the future: the use and misuse of scenarios (1996) Long range planning, 29 (2), pp. 164-171; Grant, R.M., (2013) Contemporary Strategy Analysis: Text and Cases, , Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester; Hiltunen, E., Scenarios: process and outcome (2009) Journal of Futures Studies, 13 (3), pp. 151-152; Jannek, K., Burmeister, K., Corporate foresight in small and medium-sized enterprises (2008) Foresight, (101), pp. 1-4. , Brief; Johnston, M., Gilmore, A., Carson, D., Dealing with environmental uncertainty: the value of scenario planning for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (2008) European Journal of Marketing, 42 (11-12), pp. 1170-1178; MacKay, B., McKiernan, P., Creativity and dysfunction in strategic processes: the case of scenario planning (2010) Futures, 42 (4), pp. 271-281; Mahoney, J.T., Pandian, R.J., The resource-based view within the conversation of strategic management (1992) Strategic Management Journal, 13 (5), pp. 363-380; Malaska, P., Malmivirta, M., Meristö, T., Hansen, S.O., Scenarios in Europe – who uses them and why?

It adopts the concept of sectoral innovation system as its framework. Through in-depth interviews with representatives from firms and other actors in the system, as well as a technology foresight workshop, the study reveals that there were several product innovations, namely, branded ready-to-eat, ready-to-cook, and frozen products based on Thai, Oriental, Western, and fusion recipes. These innovations were the results of changing demand conditions as well as an integration of knowledge and expertise from science, social science, art, and the services industry. These innovations were achieved through R&D departments having personnel from various disciplines, in addition to interaction between R&D and other departments within firms. In several cases, firms leveraged external knowledge through collaboration with local universities and public research institutes. The study finds that in order for convergence innovation to occur, firms must be proactive in their approach to acquiring and creating new knowledge in their industry. Convergence innovation also requires a strong, coherent sectoral innovation system to be in place. © 2015 Korean Society for Innovation Management and Economics (KOSIME).","convergence innovation; seafood industry; sectoral innovation system; technological learning; Thailand",,,,,,"(2012), http://www.thinkasiainvestthailand.com/boicontent/bisopp/pdf_6.pdf, ‘Food Industry in Thailand’, A published report.

These dynamics have a direct influence and will trigger off service innovation. Firstly, the drivers of the service economy are presented, many of them fostering service innovation as a way to face new societal and business challenges. Secondly, emerging developments are discussed to identify the most promising service innovation dynamics. Finally, foresight scenarios demonstrate possible future trends of the new service economy. These scenarios are based on a methodology developed and applied in the context of an EC-funded project on Sectoral Innovation Systems. This exercise is performed for the overall set of services activities although a particular focus is given on activities such as knowledge intensive business services and distributive trade services. Results indicate that emerging developments are those related to the reconciliation between industrialisation and customisation associated with ICT, ageing population, sustainable development and service regression and extension dynamics. The cases of knowledge intensive services and distributive trades have shown how different drivers and emerging developments are interrelated and establish different scenarios for future development. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Europe; Foresight; Future; Knowledge-intensive services; Services; Wholesale and retail trade","Commerce; Sales; Europe; Foresight; Future; Knowledge-intensive services; Retail trade; Services; Dynamics",,,,,"Barone, G., Cingano, F., Service regulation and growth: evidence from OECD countries (2008) Temi di discussione Working Papers, 645; Chesbrough, H., Schwartz, K., Innovating business models with co-development partnerships (2007) Res.

The conventional net present value (NPV) presents a static picture that does not account for the value of waiting for better market conditions to proceed with a DG investment. On the contrary, real options (RO) analysis does account for the managerial flexibility to switch between options over the investment horizon. In this paper we argue that the value of a DG wind-based project can be revisited by means of Longstaff-Schwartz method, originally intended for the evaluation of American financial options. The adaption of this method to the wind power DG setting provides a means for (i) efficiently dealing with the several stochastic processes involved (spot electricity prices and possibly various wind speed processes) avoiding the curse of dimensionality, (ii) accounting for the decaying capital cost of DG, and (iii) solving the perfect foresight problem presented by Monte Carlo conventional simulations. We present in this paper the procedure to follow when applying the method to the wind power DG setting. Particularly, we discuss the standardization of the wind speed and spot price processes, and the advantages of building a state space model that includes all the correlated processes by adequately transforming Box-Jenkins and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Also we discuss the representation of the capital cost forecast by means of learning curves. On the whole, we put together this multivariate setting and show how it is translated to the Longstaff-Schwartz framework. The developed methodological approach allows us analyzing the sensitivity of the RO value to the site and DG capacity factor, the risk-free rate, the current forward projections of global installed capacity, and the aggregation of DGs under a common owner. On the whole, we conclude that the RO analysis is best employed to analyze DG settings in which the NPV yields a close to negative assessment: low power production, for instance. In such cases, RO analysis shows advantages in producing delayed optimal investment times. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Learning curve; Real options; Stochastic processes; Wind energy conversion",,,,,,"Monjas-Barroso, M., Balibrea-Iniesta, J., Valuation of projects for power generation with renewable energy: A comparative study based on real regulatory options (2013) Energy Policy, 55, pp. 335-352; Mason, J.E., Archer, C.L., Baseload electricity from wind via compressed air energy storage (CAES) (2012) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 16, pp. 1099-1109; Johnson, J.X., De Kleine, R., Keoleian, G.A., Assessment of energy storage for transmission-constrained wind (2014) Appl Energy, 124, pp. 377-388; Welch, J.B., Venkateswaran, A., The dual sustainability of wind energy (2009) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 13, pp. 1121-1126; McKenna, R., Hollnaicher, S., Fichtner, W., Cost-potential curves for onshore wind energy: A high-resolution analysis for Germany (2014) Appl Energy, 115, pp. 103-115; Levitt, A., Kempton, W., Smith, A., Musial, W., Firestone, J., Pricing offshore wind power (2011) Energy Policy; Delucchi, M.A., Jacobson, M.Z., Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 1170-1190; Fuguitt, D., Wilcox, S.J., (1999) Cost-benefit Analysis for Public Sector Decision Makers, , Greenwood Publishing Group; Ertürk, M., The evaluation of feed-in tariff regulation of Turkey for onshore wind energy based on the economic analysis (2012) Energy Policy, 45, pp. 359-367; Benaroch, M., Managing information technology investment risk: A real options perspective (2002) J Manage Inform Syst; Venetsanos, K., Angelopoulou, P., Tsoutsos, T., Renewable energy sources project appraisal under uncertainty: The case of wind energy exploitation within a changing energy market environment (2002) Energy Policy, 30, pp. 293-307; Lee, S.-C., Shih, L.-H., Renewable energy policy evaluation using real option model the case of Taiwan (2010) Energy Econom, 32, pp. S67-S78; Kroniger, D., Madlener, R., Hydrogen storage for wind parks: A real options evaluation for an optimal investment in more flexibility (2014) Appl Energy; Yu, W., Sheblé, G.B., Lopes, J.A.P., Matos, M.A., Valuation of switchable tariff for wind energy (2006) Electr Power Syst Res, 76, pp. 382-388; Gupta, A., (2013) Risk Management and Simulation, , CRC Press; Longstaff, F.A., Schwartz, E.S., Valuing American options by simulation: A simple least-squares approach (2001) Rev Financ Stud, 14, pp. 113-147; Díaz, G., Gómez-Aleixandre, J., Coto, J., Statistical characterization of aggregated wind power from small clusters of generators (2014) Int J Electr Power Energy Syst, 62, pp. 273-283; Díaz, G., Casielles, P.G., Coto, J., Simulation of spatially correlated wind power in small geographic areas - Sampling methods and evaluation (2014) Int J Electr Power Energy Syst, 63, pp. 513-522; Durbin, J., Koopman, S.J., (2012) Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods, , 2nd ed.

I maintain that much of the psychological literature on confabulations rests on a dangerous conflation of the reasons for which people act with a variety of distinct motivational factors. In particular, I argue that subjects frequently give correct answers to questions about the considerations they acted upon while remaining largely unaware of why they take themselves to have such reasons to act. Pari passu, experimental psychologists are wrong to maintain that they have shown our everyday reason talk to be systematically confused. This is significant because our everyday reason-ascriptions affect characterizations of action (in terms of intention, knowledge, foresight, etc.) that are morally and legally relevant. I conclude, more positively, that far from rendering empirical research on confabulations invalid, my account helps to reveal its true insights into human nature. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Action explanation; Confabulation; Experimental psychology; Motivation; Reasons; Verbal reports",,,,,,"Aronson, E., (1956) When prophecy fails, , Harper, New York; Bennett, M.R., Hacker, P.M.S., (2003) Philosophical foundations of neuroscience, , Blackwell, Oxford; Bernays E (1928/2005) Propaganda, new edition.

The unprecedented growth of such ships presents an increasing challenge for port infrastructure planners. The paper concludes that during the next 20 years, the growth of container ships will depend on factors related to supply and demand, and to external factors. These factors will be defined as the constraints. These constraints have been determined using a semi-quantitative methodology, which starts with a pre-foresight analysis, then continues with a foresight analysis based on the judgement of experts, using the Delphi technique. The experts’ judgement, with a vision shared by 82% of those participating, establishes that the trend for growth in the size of container ships will depend principally on the following factors: economic growth, port access channels, berth depth alongside, air draft, and limitations in natural channels and straits. This result, representing the experts’ group vision, is offered as a basis for the establishment of long term policies. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"(2011), http://www.alphaliner.com/liner2/research_files/Alphaliner-20Kteu-ULCS.pdf; (2013), http://www.apl.com/wps/wcm/connect/9ac4350041a4b2d5bb2efb62abbb971d/APL%2BHistory.pdf?MOD=AJPERES, “Vessel History.” Accessed July 20; Ashar, A., Revolution Now (2002) Containerization International, 35, pp. 56-59; Bruijn, H., (2010) Ports of the Future—The Strategy of Port of Rotterdam & the International Ambitions, , TU DELFT presentation, Delft, June; Byklum, E., The Quantum Project—Thinking Outside the Box (2010) DNV Container Ship Update, 1, pp. 8-9; (2013), http://port2060.cargotec.com/, “Welcome to Port 2060.” Accessed July 20; Climent, A.G., (1987), http://www.histarmar.com.ar/BuquesMercantes/Onassis-1.htm; Cudahy, B.J., (2006) Box Boats, How Container Ships Changed the World, , New York: Fordham University Press; Dohlie, K., The Future of the Ultra Large Container Ship (2009) DNV Container Ship Updated, 3, pp. 22-24; Dohlie, K., Industry Questionary: Exploring Industries Needs—Environmental Footprint in Fifth Place (2010) DNV Container Ship Updated, 1, pp. 14-17; Goulielmos, A.M., Psifia, M.-E., Forecasting Short-Term Freight Rate Cycles: Do We Have a More Appropriate Method than a Normal Distribution?

Prior studies typically use the midpoint to evaluate analyst reaction to range forecasts, implicitly assuming that analysts place equal weights on the upper and the lower bounds of management range forecasts. We empirically test this restrictive assumption and provide strong evidence of unequal weights - analysts place significantly more (less) weight on the lower (upper) bound of forecast ranges. Moreover, such overweight on the lower bound is more pronounced when analysts face higher ambiguity, consistent with the ""max-min"" axiom, which predicts that decision-makers tend to assign higher probability to the worst-case scenario when facing ambiguity. Further tests show that ""optimal revisions"" with perfect foresight of actual earnings also overweight the lower bound. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,,,,"Ajinkya, B., Bhojraj, S., Sengupta, P., The association between outside directors, institutional investors and the properties of management earnings forecasts (2005) Journal of Accounting Research, 43, pp. 343-376; Ajinkya, B., Gift, M., Corporate managers' earnings forecasts and symmetrical adjustments of market expectations (1984) Journal of Accounting Research, 22, pp. 425-444; Baginski, S., Conrad, E., Hassell, J., The effects of management forecast precision on equity pricing and on the assessment of earnings uncertainty (1993) The Accounting Review, 68, pp. 913-927; Baginski, S.P., Hassell, J., The market interpretation of management earnings forecasts as a predictor of subsequent financial analyst forecast revision (1990) The Accounting Review, 65, pp. 175-190; Baginski, S.P., Hassell, J., Wieland, M., An examination of the effects of management earnings forecast form and explanations on financial analyst forecast revisions (2011) Advances in Accounting, Incorporating Advances in International Accounting, 27, pp. 17-25; Ball, R., Shivakumar, L., How much new information is there in earnings?

Between 1968 and 1974, 568 women with clinical stage I endometrial cancer received 60 Gy of vaginal brachytherapy after hysterectomy. The women were then randomized to 40 Gy pelvic radiation therapy with a central block after 20 Gy or to no further therapy. The initial analysis, published in 1980 by Aalders et al (9), reported a reduction in pelvic recurrences in patients receiving pelvic radiation but no difference in overall survival. A subset analysis of this study was among the first to report that patients with high-risk features, such as deep invasion and high grade, were most likely to benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation. In this updated report, after a median follow-up time of 20 years, there was still no difference in overall survival between the 2 arms except in women younger than 60. In this population, overall survival was lower in those receiving pelvic radiation. The decrement in survival was attributed in part to a 2-fold higher rate of secondary malignancies in the younger women who received pelvic radiation therapy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,"Diseases; Oncology;

Being an educationist and teacher in core and having a great interest to simplify the message convey to conference' participants and readers I decided to maintain the slide format of the presentation. To highlight most effectively the role played by pathogen reduction to supplement the multilayer-strategy already in place, emphasizes were placed by going back to basic focusing on: where we were, where we are now and where we are going!. The unresolved problems of viral safety of blood components and criteria of universal acceptability of PRT are highlighted so is the need for further DDR strategies both in incremental and innovative ways. Finally the issue of who would benefit from implementation of PRT is described based on published data and also providing some visionary foresights for the long term benefits of PRT in both optimizing the safety of blood supply and helping at least in health care containment. I hope this new approach will be useful to readers, providing at least some conceptual and technical supports in understanding the role of PRT in optimizing the safety of blood supply. © 2015 .","Bacterial prevention; Blood safety; Cost containment, health care cost; Criteria of acceptability; Immunomodulations; Microvesicule/BRM; Pathogen inactivation/reduction; Prion removal; Transfusion science/medicine","bacterial infection; biosafety; blood component; blood donor; blood safety; blood sampling; blood storage; blood transfusion; blood transfusion reaction; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; donor selection; health care cost; human; immunocompromised patient; infection prevention; pathogen clearance; patient safety; process optimization; protocol compliance; quality control; Review; thrombocyte preservation; transfusion transmitted infection; variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease; virus infection; Bacterial Infections; blood bank; blood component therapy; blood safety; bloodborne bacterium; cost control; disinfection; male; patient safety; Prion Diseases; procedures; program development; standards; transmission; Virus Diseases; Bacterial Infections; Blood Banks; Blood Component Transfusion; Blood Donors; Blood Preservation; Blood Safety; Blood-Borne Pathogens; Cost Control; Disinfection; Donor Selection; Humans; Male; Patient Safety; Prion Diseases; Program Development; Virus Diseases",,,,,"Salunkhe, V., van der Meer, P.F., de Krote, D., Seghatchian, J., Gutierrez, L., Development of blood transfusion product pathogen reduction treatments: a review of methods, current applications and demands (2015) Transfus Apheres Sci; de Sousa, G., Seghatchian, J., Current opinion on pathogen reduction treatments of blood components (2015) Transfus Apheres Sci, , Trasci 1816; Seghatchian, J., Putter, J.S., Pathogen inactivation of whole blood and red cell components: an overview of concept, design, developments, criteria of acceptability and storage lesion (2013) Transfusion and Apheres Sci, 49, pp. 357-363; Seghatchian, J., Hervig, T., Putter, J.S., Effect of pathogen inactivation on the storage lesion in red cells and platelet concentrates (2011) Transfus Apheres Sci, 45, pp. 75-84; Seghatchian, J., de Sousa, G., Pathogen-reduction systems for blood components: the current position and future trends (2006) Transfus Apheres Sci, 35, pp. 189-196; Irsch, J., Seghatchian, J., Update on pathogen inactivation treatment of Plasma, with the INTERCEPT Blood System: current position on methodological, clinical and regulatory aspects (2015) Transfus Apheres Sci, , Trasci 1819; Goodrich, R.P., Edrich, R.A., Li, J., Seghatchian, J., The Mirasol PRT system for pathogen reduction of platelets and plasma: an overview of current status and the future trends (2006) Transfus Apheres Sci, 35 (1), pp. 5-17; Seghatchian, J., Tolksdorf, F., Characteristics of the Theraflex UV-Platelets pathogen inactivation system - an update (2012) Transfus Apheres Sci, 46, pp. 221-229; Krailadsiri, P., Seghatchian, J., Bode, A.P., Microvesicles in blood components: laboratory and clinical aspects (1997) Clin Appl Thrombosis/Hemostasis, 3, pp. 86-95; Krailadsiri, P., Seghatchian, J., Macgregor, I., The effects of leukodepletion on the generation and removal of microvesicles and prion protein in blood components (2006) Transfusion, 46, pp. 407-417; Neisser-Svae, A., Seghatchian, J., The state of the art of removal of prion proteins in SD-FFP, by specific prion affinity chromatography and its impact on the hemostatic characteristics of the product (2015) Transfus Apheres Sci, , Trasci 1818; Seghatchian, J., Allain, J.P., Current strategies for the provision of safer plasma and its derivatives: an update (2001) Transfus Apheres Sci, 25 (1), pp. 85-87; Seghatchian, J., Walker, W.H., Reichenburg, S., Updates on pathogen inactivation of plasma using Theraflex methylene blue system (2008) Transfus Apheres Sci, 38 (3), pp. 271-280; Seghatchian, J., Struff, W.G., Reichenburg, S., Main properties of the Theraflex MB-plasma system for pathogen reduction (2011) Transfus Med Hemother, 38, pp. 55-64; Solheim, B.G., Seghatchian, J., (2009) Rossi's Principles of Transfusion Medicine, , Chapter 51, Ltd.

To this end, the Netherlands Models and Data-Centre implemented a pilot chain of sequentially linked models to project local climate impacts on hydrology, agriculture and nature under different national climate scenarios for a small region in the east of the Netherlands named Baakse Beek. The chain of models sequentially linked in that pilot includes a (future) weather generator and models of respectively subsurface hydrogeology, ground water stocks and flows, soil chemistry, vegetation development, crop yield and nature quality. These models typically have mismatching time step sizes and grid cell sizes. The linking of these models unavoidably involves the making of model assumptions that can hardly be validated, such as those needed to bridge the mismatches in spatial and temporal scales. Here we present and apply a method for the systematic critical appraisal of model assumptions that seeks to identify and characterize the weakest assumptions in a model chain. The critical appraisal of assumptions presented in this paper has been carried out ex-post. For the case of the climate impact model chain for Baakse Beek, the three most problematic assumptions were found to be: land use and land management kept constant over time; model linking of (daily) ground water model output to the (yearly) vegetation model around the root zone; and aggregation of daily output of the soil hydrology model into yearly input of a so called 'mineralization reduction factor' (calculated from annual average soil pH and daily soil hydrology) in the soil chemistry model. Overall, the method for critical appraisal of model assumptions presented and tested in this paper yields a rich qualitative insight in model uncertainty and model quality. It promotes reflectivity and learning in the modelling community, and leads to well informed recommendations for model improvement. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","assumption hunting; knowledge quality assessment; NUSAP; pedigree analysis; sensitivity auditing; uncertainty","Agriculture; Chains; Climate change; Decision making; Decision support systems; Groundwater; Groundwater geochemistry; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Hydrology; Land use; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; assumption hunting; NUSAP; Pedigree analysis; Quality assessment; sensitivity auditing; uncertainty; Climate models; climate effect; climate modeling; decision support system; regional climate; sensitivity analysis; soil chemistry; uncertainty analysis; Netherlands",,,,,"Bakker, A., Bessembinder, J.J.E., (2012) Integraal Waterbeheer - Kritische Zone and Onzekerheden.

The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approachIan Yeoman interviews one of the world's most prominent and respected futurists, Professor Jim Dator, from the Futures Research Center of the University of Hawaii at Manoa's Political Science Department. FindingsLike a climatologist, futurists discuss long‐term futures which are very uncertain, controversial, and often frightening stories. The past tells how the present occurred. Understanding that story is essential before considering the future. The growth of tourism is a fabulous story dependent on many developments whose future is uncertain. The tourism industry may want a “more of the same” trajectory of continued economic growth but a number changes are on the horizon which Dator calls “The Unholy Trinity,” namely the end of cheap and abundant energy; a profoundly unstable environment and a dysfunctional global economic system. Dator concludes that no government now governs satisfactorily, and so the future of tourism is extremely precarious and uncertain. Originality/valueThe interview provides both insight into how tourism has evolved and foresight of what could occur in the futures. Central to the interview is Dator's identification of the Unholy Trinity, Plus One, that suggests that the future will not neither be like the present nor like the future the tourism industry has hoped for in terms of continued economic growth.

Huxley possessed a sober understanding of the human condition as well as an inspired vision of the human potential. This volume presents an interdisciplinary examination and appreciation of Aldous Huxley�s three visionary novels � Brave New World (1932), Ape and Essence (1948), and Island (1962) � to reveal the extent to which Huxley�s prognoses into our possible futures was prophetic. The author assesses each novel to reveal the foresights that define our current educational, social, religious, political, and economic institutions, while also exposing our conflicts within those institutions. This volume examines the educational, cultural and technological changes that have shaped our society since Huxley�s work, with special reference to the enduring legacy of educational philosopher John Dewey. It offers profound insights into the educational forces and moral foundations of our society that shape us, both inside and outside of our schools. It is the first of its kind to focus exclusively on all three of Huxley�s visionary novels and detail their relevance to our world today. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

To achieve such efficiency, a multitude of technological and process-related approaches are currently being developed. The aim of this paper is to utilize technology foresight to identify the technologies and processes, which might be relevant for sustainable production in the German automotive industry in the future. Therefore, we conducted a Delphi survey with practitioners and practice-oriented researchers concerning future technologies and their postulated effect on sustainability goals in the automotive industry. The assessments were grouped into five categories: short-term developments, uncertain short-term to mid-term developments, (certain) short-term to mid-term developments, mid-term developments, and long-term developments. These categories provide insight regarding potential drivers (cost reduction, customer demands, and legal requirements) and hindrances (costs associated with large investments) for the implementation of various technologies. Major automotive suppliers are expected to adopt new sustainable technologies faster than small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) since they have the financial means to make investments and sufficient production volumes for automation, and modify production arrangements more often. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Automotive; Sustainable production; Technology Delphi; Technology foresight","Automotive industry; Cost reduction; Investments; Supply chains; Automotive; Automotive supplier industry; Environmental sustainability; Long-term development; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Sustainable production; Sustainable technology; Technology foresight; Sustainable development; automobile industry; Delphi analysis; industrial production; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability; technology adoption; Germany",,,,,"Abu-Farha, F.K., Khraisheh, M.K., An integrated approach to the superplastic forming of lightweight alloys: towards sustainable manufacturing (2008) Int.

It is predicted to include climate change, rapid population growth, resource scarcity, resurgence in ideology, and shifts in power from west to east. Many of these changes are likely to have an impact on the health of civil societies and those military personnel deployed by states to counter these challenges. This paper considers the potential impact of emerging global strategic trends on health service support (HSS) in the Future Operating Environment 2035. Global Strategic Trends—Out to 2040, The Future Character of Conflict and NATO Strategic Foresight Analysis Report 2013 provide the foundations of the paper. The study concludes that future impacts on HSS are neither completely predictable nor predetermined, and there is always a possibility of a strategic shock. Knowledge of vulnerability, however, allows an informed approach to the development and evaluation of adaptive strategies to lessen risks to health. © 2015, Royal Army Medical College.

This includes appointing a Commissioner with a newly defined remit for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and the members of the various Committees of the European Parliament with competences related to maritime affairs. These individuals will invariably spend at least part of their first months in office identifying their respective priorities for the coming years. This commentary seeks to contribute to these deliberations by making concrete suggestions for priorities that might be considered as regards the future of the EU's Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP). Seven years since its launch, the IMP remains very much a work in progress. Drawing on recent academic studies of the EU's various ocean related policies this commentary argues that two of the greatest weaknesses of the IMP are the sectoral nature of priority-setting and strategy-making as well as the lack of a funding tool to implement its aims. Two concrete proposals are made, specifically aimed at the incoming EU leadership, which seek to address these weaknesses and to realize the aims articulated in the IMP. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","European Union; Foresight; Innovation; Integrated Maritime Policy","European Union; leadership; marine policy; policy making; Europe",,,,,"(2014), p. 1. , From Decline to Recovery: A Rescue Package for the Global Ocean (Report Summary); (2007) Commission Staff Working Document Accompanying the Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union, 1278, p. 4; http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2004-2009/borg/priorities_en.htm; van Hoof, L., Tatenhove, J., EU marine policy on the move: the tension between fisheries and maritime policy (2009) Mar Policy, 33, pp. 726-732; Rätz, H.-J., Complementary roles of European and national institutions under the Common Fisheries Policy and the Marine Strategy Frame work Directive (2010) Mar Policy, 34, pp. 1028-1035; Wakefield, J., Undermining the Integrated Maritime Policy (2010) Mar Pollut Bull, 60, pp. 323-333; Fock, H.O., Linking marine fisheries to environmental objectives: a casestudy on seafloorin tegrity under European maritime policies (2011) Environ Sci Policy, 14, pp. 289-300; Markus, T., Legal Implementation of Integrated Ocean Policies: the EU's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2011) Int J Mar Coastal Law, 26, pp. 59-90; Salomon, M., Dross, M., Challenges in cross-sectoral marine protection in Europe (See, for example) (2013) Mar Policy, 42, pp. 142-149; (2012) Parts of this section have been previously published as CSAOceans, , Preliminary definitional report and review of existing foresight processes relevant to JPI Oceans; Hoof, L.V., van Tatenhove, J., EU marine policy on the move: the tension between fisheries and maritime policy (2009) Mar Policy, 33, pp. 726-732; (2014) A Practical Guide to Regional Foresight 2001.

Engaging stakeholders in foresight processes can increase the robustness of foresight knowledge, broaden the spectrum of issues addressed, and create 'ownership' of the process. While in foresight practices stakeholder participation becomes more and more popular to resort to as enabling factor for generating salient, legitimate and credible foresight knowledge, participation can also compromise these qualities. We analysed two foresight projects conducted at the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, one that developed future visions for Dutch nature policy and another that focused on future pathways for Dutch urban sustainable development policy. We illustrate that the dynamics of the research setting - changes in the socio-political context and the internal dynamics of the participatory efforts - complicated the balancing process. We conclude that one of the main challenges for futures practitioners is, therefore, to work within the dynamics of the research setting, and to position themselves strategically in this setting; by acting as 'reflective futures practitioners'. © 2014 The Authors.","Credibility; Foresight practice; Legitimacy; Reflective practitioner; Salience; Stakeholder participation","environmental assessment; knowledge; ownership; participatory approach; policy making; stakeholder; sustainable development; urban development; urban policy; Netherlands",,,,,"Andreescu, L., Gheorghiu, R., Zulean, M., Curaj, A., Understanding normative foresight outcomes: Scenario development and the 'veil of ignorance' effect (2013) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 80, pp. 711-722; Berkhout, F., van den Hurk, B., Bessembinder, J., de Boer, J., Bregman, B., van Drunen, M., Framing climate uncertainty: Socio-economic and climate scenarios in vulnerability and adaptation assessments (2014) Regional Environmental Change, 14, pp. 879-893; Borch, K., Mérida, F., Dialogue in foresight: Consensus conflict and negotiation (2013) Participation and interaction in foresight: Dialogue, dissemination and visions, , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, K.

In order to reach this goal, the following intellectual traditions are introduced to review the philosophical and historical contexts that affect the very foundations of futures studies: (a) religions, (b) utopias, (c) historicism, (d) science fiction, and (e) systems thinking. The first phase (beginning in 1945 to the 1960s) was the era of scientific inquiry and rationalization of the futures characterized by the prevalence of technological forecasting, the rise of alternative futures in systematic ways, and the growth of professionalization of futures studies. In the first phase, futures had become objects of rationalization removed from the traditional approaches such as utopia, grandiose evolutionary ideas, naive prophecies, science fiction, religious attitudes, and mystical orientation. The second phase (the 1970s and the 1980s) saw the creation the global institution and industrialization of the futures. This era was marked by the rise of worldwide discourse on global futures, the development of normative futures, and the deep involvement of the business community in futures thinking. In the second phase, futures studies-industry ties were growing and the future-oriented thoughts extensively permeated the business decision-making process. The third phase (the 1990s - the present) reflects the current era of the neoliberal view and fragmentation of the futures. This phase is taking place in the time of neoliberal globalization and risk society discourses and is characterized by the dominance of foresight, the advance of critical futures studies, and the intensification of fragmentation. In the third phase, futures practice tends to be confined to the support of strategic planning, and hence is experiencing an identity crisis and loss of its earlier status of humanity-oriented futures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fragmentation of futures; History of western futures studies; Industrialization of futures; Intellectual tradition; Periodization; Rationalization of futures","decision making; economic history; historical perspective; industrial history; industrialization; modernization; neoliberalism; periodicity; rationalization",,,,,"Anderson, J., The great future struggle: Futures studies and the struggle for the world (2010), Proceedings of the paper presented at conference of governing the future, Ceri, France on June 14; Anderson, M.M., Jørgensen, B.H., Technology foresight: The potential for wiring up the national innovation system (2004) International Association of Management of Technology Conferences, , http://www.iamot.org/conference/index.php, Cited 04.23.10. /ocs/4/paper/view/531/62; Ariell, A., Forest futures: A causal layered analysis (2010) Journal of Futures Studies, 14 (4), pp. 49-64; Arnaldi, S., Framing pragmatic validity: Theoretical reorientations of the regio futures (2008) Faces of the 21st Century, pp. 108-121. , Oficyna Wydawnicza Rewasz, Poland, A.

Different user groups manage and consume these touristic ES differently, resulting in discrepancies and potential conflicts. Despite the urgency to find inclusive local approaches for sustainable development, tourism studies still analyze socio-economic and ecological impacts separately and lack integrated social-ecological approaches to improve foresight in tourism planning. Based on a growing concern regarding the future of Costalegre on the Jalisco coast of Western Mexico, we analyze through interviews, surveys, and participant observation the dependence of tourism on specific ecosystem services and conduct a scenario analysis which shows present and future implications for the social-ecological system. Furthermore, this analysis shows in detail how different scenarios change ES provision and people's livelihoods. Key findings include identifying freshwater provision and cultural ES as the most important touristic ES. At a regional scale, peasants in ejidos are the main ES stewards, whereas high-class tourism facilities constitute important local stewards. Benefits, mainly access to freshwater and the beach, are unequally distributed, provoking conflicts among different ES user groups that may escalate in the near future. Improved communication between all user groups and strengthening of key political actors seem to be the most immediate recommendations to ensure the long term sustainability of this particular region. This work may contribute to improved planning and decision-making as our ES based scenarios are a first step to integrate social-ecological knowledge into improved decision-making. At a local scale, the study reveals the most likely future development options and their social and ecological consequences. It could also serve as a baseline for informed policy making. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecosystem services stewards and beneficiaries; Environmental discrepancies and conflicts; Integrated social-ecological management; Scenario analysis; Touristic ecosystem services","decision making; ecosystem service; ecotourism; integrated approach; service provision; sustainable development; tourism management; Jalisco; Mexico [North America]",,,,,"Andereck, K.L., Valentine, K.M., Knopf, R.C., Vogt, C.A., Residents' perceptions of community tourism impacts (2005) Annals of Tourism Research, 32, pp. 1056-1076; Ávila-García, P., Sánchez-Luna, E., The environmentalism of the rich and the privatization of nature high-end tourism on the Mexican Coast (2012) Latin American Perspectives, 39 (6), pp. 51-67; Barbier, E.B., Hacker, S.D., Kennedy, C., Koch, E.M., Stier, A.C., Silliman, B.R., The value of estuarine and coastal ecosystem services (2011) Ecological Monographs, 81, pp. 169-219; Barton, J., How green is golf?

The Nano 1 => Nano 2 transition is discussed and interpreted, as a transition where, on one hand, applications of nanotechnology are spreading in all sectors of industry, and new research challenges appear. The perception of the term nanotechnology by various stakeholders: academia, industry, public organisations funding research, and society, is discussed. According to the authors, we are in a period, where nanotechnology is becoming so common, and is present in all areas of industry that in most cases mentioned any more as a special kind of technology. Issues of low-cost production of high-quality nanomaterials, as well as their safety and regulation become of crucial importance for economic exploitation of the benefits of nanotechnology. However, the societal perception of nanotechnology is not matching its real understanding and widespread application in science and industry. This may rise barriers for its applications and commercialization. At the same time, research and application opportunities nanotechnology offers are increasing exponentially at a very fast rate. Rapidly expanding is the field of nanoarchitecture and nanobiotechnology, where various nanosized materials as well as molecules are combined in hierarchical nanostructures. Further, picotechnology is emerging, where materials are investigated and engineered at a less than 1 nm scale. Finally, nanotechnology is, or will be soon, offering solutions for most of the societal needs of the 21st century, like radically improved medical treatments and diagnosis, clean water supply, renewable energy supply, and low-cost communication technologies. It may lead also to breakthrough in artificial intelligence development. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Only recently have scholars (for example, Clinton, 2012, American Journal of Political Science, 56, 355-372; Clinton & Meirowitz, 2004, American Journal of Political Science, 48, 675-689) started to assess how knowledge about the sequence of votes may help us to understand the legislative process in more detail. Many of these analyses are, however, predicated on quite important assumptions regarding the forward-looking capacities of MPs. In this paper, this more recent literature is drawn on and brought to bear on an analysis of two bills adopted in the Swiss parliament. Having detailed information available on MPs’ preferences over various options voted upon, it is possible to test whether MPs behave strategically, and to what degree they are capable of anticipating the way forward through the agenda tree. Evidence is found that MPs behave strategically, but their foresight is not as perfect as one would expect from theoretical models. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Agenda; Parliament; Strategy; Swiss politics; Voting",,,,,,"Amorim Neto, O., Cox, G.W., McCubbins, M.D., Agenda power in Brazil’s Câmara Dos Deputados, 1989 to 1998 (2003) World Politics, 55, pp. 550-578; Arrow, K.J., (1951) Social Choice and Individual Values, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Austen-Smith, D., Sophisticated sincerity: Voting over endogenous agendas (1987) American Political Science Review, 81, pp. 1323-1329; Bailer, S., Bütikofer, S., (2013) Party Discipline in Switzerland, , Unpublished manuscript; Bailer, S., Bütikofer, S., Hug, S., Schulz, T., (2007) Preferences, Party Discipline and Constituency Pressure in Swiss Parliamentary Decisions, , Paper presented at the ECPR General Conference, Pisa; Benoit, K., Laver, M., (2006) Party Policy in Modern Democracies, , London: Routledge; Besley, T., Coate, S., Issue unbundling via citizens’ initiatives (2008) Quarterly Journal of Political Science, 3, pp. 379-397; Bjurulf, B.H., Niemi, R.G., Strategic voting in Scandinavian parliaments (1978) Scandinavian Political Studies, 1, pp. 5-22; Bräuninger, T., Debus, M., Legislative agenda-setting in parliamentary democracies (2009) European Journal of Political Research, 48, pp. 804-839; Calvert, R.L., Fenno, R.F., Jr., Strategy and sophisticated voting in the Senate (1994) Journal of Politics, 56, pp. 349-376; Calvo, E., The responsive legislature: Public opinion and law making in a highly disciplined legislature (2007) British Journal of Political Science, 36, pp. 263-280; Carey, J.M., (2009) Legislative Voting and Accountability, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Carroll, R., Poole, K., Roll call analysis and the study of legislatures (2014) The Oxford Handbook of Legislative Studies, pp. 103-124. , S.

Issues arising along the development pathway include cell manufacture and scale-up challenges, affected by regulatory demands emerging from the innovation ecosystem (preclinical testing and clinical trials).

Traditionally, foresight activities involves Delphi, focus group, or Estimate–Talk–Estimate techniques to collect opinions of an expert panel. Often, these techniques are not computerized and data visualization is rudimentary. Our highly-interactive FSS solves a number of inherent issues during the data collection, analysis, and results visualization processes. Despite that MCDM methods have been recommended for technology foresight, a validation with a real field experiment was still required. To evaluate our approach and FSS, we conducted a foresight exercise for the Swiss mobile payments market. Our research confirms that the use of MCDM methods supported with a computerized tool can enhance the foresight processes and results. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Foresight support systems; MCDM methods; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Aguilar, F., (1967) Scanning the business environment, , Macmillan, New York:; Bañuls, V.A., Salmeron, J.L., Scope and design issues in foresight support systems (2011) Int J Foresight Innov Policy, 7 (4), pp. 338-351; Basch, C., Focus group interview: an underutilized research technique for improving theory and practice in health education (1987) Health Educ Behav, 14 (4), pp. 411-448; Benayoun, R., Roy, B., Sussmann, B., Manuel de réference du programme electre.

Strategia Sapiens refers to the fact that strategic work needs to be foresight oriented, and foresight should be directly value driven. Design/methodology/approach – The following areas of strategic foresight are offered for discussion: the content of a vision, its emergence process and the characteristics of strategic foresight in time and in space. Findings – The interdisciplinary approach of this research creates a synthesis of and bases its findings on the empirical and theoretical findings of different scientific fields. The primary finding is that nurture theory offers new perspectives to refine and renew strategic foresight. One perspective is the existence of a value- and culture-driven way of life, and the other is the simultaneous self-realisation of individuals. The paper creates the following models on the basis of nurture theory: the system relations of strategic foresight, a complex model of development, the field and system of strategic foresight activities, the logistic life-cycle model and the field of force of social spaces. Originality/value – This discussion and approach are highly useful for regional and national strategic practitioners, and they contribute to the discussion of the concept and measurement of development. The nurture theory approach strengthens the incorporation of cultural responsibility, as well as an intergenerational view of strategic foresight, which are both fundamental for a renewal of this field. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consciousness; Culture; Methodology; Nurture; Regional development; Strategic foresight; Time management",,,,,,"Ancsel, É., (1978) Történelem és alternatívák: A cselekvés választútjai [History and alternatives: The optional paths of action], , Kossuth, Budapest; Baltes, P.B., Lindenberger, U., Staudinger, U.M., Life span theory in developmental psychology (2007) Handbook of Child Psychology: Theoretical Models of Human Development, pp. 594-664. , Lerner, R.M.

In other words, participants create knowledge about the future. Interaction between the participants is a key ingredient of foresight, yet this dynamic interaction has rarely been studied from the perspective of knowledge creation. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by looking at how, and through what kinds of dynamics, knowledge is created in a foresight workshop; how it is manifested; and what are the special characteristics of futures knowledge. We develop a typology of knowledge in foresight workshops, and construct an exploratory methodological approach for analysing the knowledge creation dynamics in transcribed workshop discussions. Based on the results from the analysis of two workshop discussions, we argue that futures knowledge is founded on the knowledge base formed by the participants and new knowledge is created both through cumulative discussion flow and revelatory statements which reframe the discussion or challenge implicit assumptions. We argue that the typology of knowledge as well as the exploratory method aid in understanding futures expertise and support the planning of foresight processes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Foresight process; Futures knowledge; Knowledge creation; Knowledge typology; Workshop","Knowledge based systems; Foresight; Futures knowledge; Knowledge creations; Knowledge typology; Workshop; Dynamics; knowledge; planning process; stakeholder",,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Holmström, J., Multi-ontology topology of the strategic landscape in three practical cases (2010) Technol.

Future oriented processes and episodic foresight have been indicated as a grounding basis of important developmental achievements such as planning, self-regulation and social adaptation. Also, it was postulated that the theory of mind and episodic foresight are related due to a shared common neural substrate. The objective of the fi rst study, in which 15 children aged 3 and 4 participated, was to explore the developmental coherence between episodic foresight measures and the self-imposed delay of gratifi cation controlled by the reasoning ability. In Study 2, 78 children were tested in episodic foresight, future oriented processes and theory of mind controlled by the language ability. Results show that the different measures of episodic foresight are highly equivalent. Also, in both studies a high behavioral coherence between all the measures analyzed was found. Nevertheless, data do not support the inclusion of episodic foresight in the broader constructs studied.","Episodic cognition; Episodic foresight; Future oriented processes; Prospection; Theory of mind",,,,,,"Atance, C., Jackson, L., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102, pp. 379-391; Atance, C., Meltzoff, A., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361; Atance, C., O'Neill, D., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Science, 5, pp. 533-539; Atance, C., O'Neill, D., The emergence of episodic future thinking in humans (2005) Learning and Motivation, 36, pp. 126-144; Bembenutty, H., Karabenick, S., Inherent association between academic delay of gratifi cation, future time perspective and self-regulated learning (2004) Educational Psychology Review, 16, pp. 35-57; Bischof, D., (2008) Perspective taking, mental time travel, gender constancy and child-parent-relationship in four year olds: How they connect, , July, Paper presented at the International Congress of Psychology, Berlin, Germany; Buckner, R., Carroll, D., Self-projection and the brain (2007) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, pp. 49-57; Burgemeister, B., Hollander, L., Lorge, I., (1983) Escala de Madurez Mental de Columbia, , Madrid, España: TEA; Carlson, S.M., Moses, L.J., Individual differences in inhibitory control and children's theory of mind (2001) Child Development, 72, pp. 1032-1053; Carlson, S.M., Moses, L.J., Claxton, L.J., Individual differences in executive functioning and theory of mind: An investigation of inhibitory control and planning ability (2004) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 87, pp. 299-319; Dunn, L.M., Dunn, L.M., Arribas, D., (2006) PPVT-III PEABODY.

It further tests the moderating effect of environment dynamism (IND) on the associations between these first-order foresight capabilities and SME PSA. The results of the study have endorsed that foresight capabilities, specifically, environmental scanning, developing network ties, analysing, industry dynamics, and planning and visioning all have high level of direct impact on SMEs ability to strategically adapt their products or services to the market and customer needs. However, the results find no support for the interaction effect of industry dynamics on these associations. These findings contribute to the foresight and capabilities literature.

The relationship between foresight and policy-making has been presented in the literature by the policy-related functions of foresight, but the literature reflects a theoretical gap with the systematic evaluation model for the impact of foresight on policy-making. This research seeks to bridge the existing gap and uses the mixed method for this purpose. The mixed method approach used in this paper is the sequential exploratory design. First, the conceptual model is developed in the qualitative part of this research by using meta-synthesis and constant comparative method (CCM) of analysis. Second, in the quantitative part, quantitative tests are used to evaluate the dimensions and components of the developed theoretical model. The data collection tool is a questionnaire. The results confirm the proposed dimensions of the evaluation model. © 2015, Taylor & Francis.","evaluation; impacts of foresight; innovation capability; policy-related functions of foresight; strategic policy intelligence tool","conceptual framework; innovation; methodology; modeling; policy making; policy strategy; technology policy",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., (2011), “Grand Challenges – A New Framework for Foresight Evaluation?” EU-SPRI conference, Manchester, September 20–2; Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting Foresight Process Impacts: Steps Towards the Development of a Framework Conceptualising the Dynamics of ‘Foresight Systems.’ (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75, pp. 539-557; Ashford, L.S., Smith, R.R., De Souza, R.M., Fikree, F.F., Yinger, N.V., Creating Windows of Opportunity for Policy Change: Incorporating Evidence into Decentralized Planning in Kenya (2006) Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 84, pp. 669-672; Boeije, H., A Purposeful Approach to the Constant Comparative Method in the Analysis of Qualitative Interviews (2002) Quality and Quantity, 36, pp. 391-409; Burns, A., (2002), “Is Futures Studies a Science or an Art?” The Knowledge Base of Futures Studies 1–5: 371–37; Calof, J., Smith, J.E., Emerald Article: Foresight Impacts from Around the World: A Special Issue (2012) Foresight, 14, pp. 5-14; Creswell, J.W., Plano-Clark, V.L., Gutman, M.L., Hanson, W.E., Advanced Mixed Methods Research Designs (2003) Handbook of Mixed Methods in Social & Behavioral Research, pp. 209-240. , Tashakkori A., Teddlie C., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sag; Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The Impact of Foresight on Policy-making: Insights from the FORLEARN Mutual Learning Process (2008) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 20, pp. 369-387; De Smedt, P., (2006), “Interactions Between Foresight and Decision-making.” Second international Seville seminar on ‘future-oriented technology analysis: impact of FTA approaches on policy and decision-making’, Seville, September 28–2; Dyba, T., An Instrument for Measuring the Key Factors of Success in Software Process Improvement (2000) Empirical Software Engineering, 5, pp. 357-390; Edwards, M., (2005), “Social Science Research and Public Policy: Narrowing the Divide 1.” Australian Journal of Public Administration 64: 68–7; Georghiou, L., (2006), Issues in the Evaluation of Innovation and Technology Policy.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper describes a case study that investigated the design, implementation, and outcomes of a foresight project at a Finnish higher education institution that selected sales and services as its institutional focus areas. According to the institutional strategy, all students should have acquired solid sales and service skills before the completion of their studies. The foresight methods used in this study were e-Delphi, futures workshops, and futures narratives. The data gathered in this iterative foresight process resulted in the delineation of eight future sales and service roles and their related competences, which were subsequently used for redesigning curricula, new programme development, and personnel training. Findings – With the careful choice of foresight methods, the organisation was not only able to define future competence needs based on the collective wisdom of its stakeholders, but also fostered the organisation’s strategic transformation process. Practical implications – This paper gives insight into how to use a foresight process to foster institution-wide change. Originality/value – This is one of only a few studies on how higher education institutions could implement their positioning strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2015.","Delphi; Foresight; Institutional positioning; Profiling; Sensemaking; Strategy; Transformative change; Universities of applied sciences",,,,,,"Balogun, J., Johnson, G., Organizational restructuring and middle manager sensemaking (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47 (4), pp. 523-549; Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Future Studies, 1. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ; Bonaccorsi, A., Dario, C., Theoretical perspectives on university strategy (2007) Universities and Strategic Knowledge Creation, Specialization and Performance in Europe, pp. 3-30. , in Bonaccorsi, A. and Dario, C, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Boyatzis, R.E., Transforming Qualitative Information (1998) Thematic Analysis and Code Development, , Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA; Dameron, S., Durand, T., (2013) Strategies for Business Schools in a Multi-Polar World, Education+Training, 55 (4-5), pp. 323-335; Deeter-Schmelz, D.R., Kennedy, K.N., A global perspective on the current state of sales education in the college curriculum (2011) Journal of Personal Selling &Amp; Sales Management, 21 (1), pp. 55-75; Donohoe, H., Stellefson, M., Tennant, B., Advantages and limitations of the e-Delphi 57 i technique: Implications for health education researchers (2012) American Journal of Health ’ Education, 43 (1), pp. 38-46; Elena-Perez, S., Saritas, O., Pook, K., Warden, C., Ready for the future?

Design/methodology/approach – Three moderating factors, actors mindfulness, organisational context and organisational ambidexterity, are used in a Routines-Foresight Model to explain how and when organisational routines might influence strategic foresight integration. In addition, the interactions between the ostensive and performative aspects of routines are linked to the concept of routines as generative structures to provide a solid theoretical foundation for the relationship between routines and foresight. Findings – The success (or failure) of foresight integration is partly a result of the nature of interaction between the ostensive and performative aspects of routines within a focal organisation. As a result of the characteristic embeddedness of routines in organisations however, certain factors further act as moderators to contribute to a holistic explanation of how the ostensive and performative interaction influence foresight integration success. Research limitations/implications – This paper proposes that routines, whether seen from a change or stability-inducing perspective, could lead to success or failure in foresight integration depending on how the moderating factors (actor’s mindfulness, organisational context and organisational ambidexterity) are managed to accommodate feedback from an organisation’s external environment. In this way, the model proposed challenges present perceptions of routines as leading to successful change behaviours if flexibility is allowed or to failure if they are rigid and unchanging. Practical implications – Cultivating strategic foresight involves the integration of foresight into organisational decisions and requires organisations to pay attention to understanding the organizing logic of its organizing routines and the contextual factors within which these routines are performed. Originality/value – The paper draws on the organisational routines literature to develop new insights into the cultivation of organisational foresightfulness. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Mindfulness; Organizational routines; Ostensive and performative routines; Strategic foresight",,,,,,"Andersen, P.H., Kragh, H., Managing creativity in business market relationships (2013) Industrial Marketing Management, 42 (1), pp. 82-85; Becker, M.C., A framework for applying organizational routines in empirical research: Linking antecedents, characteristics and performance outcomes of recurrent interaction patterns (2005) Industrial and Corporate Change, 42 (5), pp. 817-846; Becker, M.C., Knudsen, T., The role of routines in reducing pervasive uncertainty (2005) Journal of Business Research, 58 (6), pp. 746-757; Becker, M.C., Lazaric, N., Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., Applying organizational routines in understanding organizational change (2005) Industrial and Corporate Change, 14 (5), pp. 775-791; Becker, M.C., Zirpoli, F., Applying organizational routines in analyzing the behavior of organizations (2008) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 66 (1), pp. 128-148; Becker, M.C., Zirpoli, F., Innovation routines: Exploring the role of procedures and stable behaviour patterns in innovation (2009) Organizational Routines: Advancing Empirical Research, pp. 223-248. , Becker, M. and Lazaric, N.

Weak signals, also conceptualised as trends, can be considered the most relevant input for developing foresight in an organisation. While detecting weak signals has traditionally relied on the news media, cultural products such as literature, movies, art, or computer games appear to have been neglected in the practice of foresight.However, literary genres such as novels can be a valuable source for developing foresight. Literature can be characterised as delivering ""thick descriptions"". Not only do novels describe social practices, but from them the reader also gains, for instance, deep insights into the feelings and emotions of the characters.These thick descriptions are even more interesting in the context of foresight when one considers that these descriptions play a role in the construction of social reality and therefore can influence, over time, reality, or rather translate fiction into fact. It can be argued that the new departs from cultural products, before translating into widely accepted social practices or mass-market products. The value of using literature in foresight also appears to be related to the notion that these narratives can be read as scenarios, revealing the potential of literature. Because of their narrative structure, these scenarios can overcome cognitive barriers in the development of foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cultural products; Foresight; Narratives; Trends","Computer games; Signal detection; Cultural products; Foresight; Market products; Narrative structures; Narratives; Social practices; Social reality; Trends; Translation (languages); conceptual framework; culture; organizational framework; trend analysis",,,,,"Liebl, F., Schwarz, J.O., Normality of the future: trend diagnosis for strategic foresight (2010) Futures, 42 (4), pp. 313-327; Liebl, F., The anatomy of complex societal problems and its implications for OR (2002) J.

When a company fails, this is often not much related to operational aspects but to an inability to think holistically about the driving forces that may change its business landscape in a disruptive way. Based on this, organizations are nowadays seeking different approaches to cope with uncertainty, and as a result, Foresight as a supporting tool to long range planning is gaining popularity at corporate and governmental level. Given that projects share with Foresight the same orientation towards the future and both lead with uncertainty, it is thus relevant to ask whether Foresight can be used to improve Project Management practice. In order to research into these questions, this paper conducted a systematic review on the topic of Foresight in leading Project Management literature. The review revealed that an explicit relationship between Foresight and Project Management exists, and although with limitations, evidence suggests that there is value in adopting Foresight. This study makes a contribution to the body of empirical works in this field and is intended to be primarily used by Project Management practitioners and practically-oriented academics who are interested in developing fresh insights into new approaches for better management of projects. © 2015 The Authors.

The proposed management instrument goes beyond the existing roadmapping and corporate Foresight approaches by integrating them and showing the interface to corporate strategy building. Corporate Foresight and integrated roadmaps are closely interlinked and show reasonable potential to maintain the current level of organizational innovation culture and also enable future improvements. We propose a new roadmap structure and reveal the main ways to use this technique in business planning. Finally, the paper applies the suggested approach through case studies of major Russian companies in the oil & gas, energy, and aviation sectors. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate Foresight; Innovation management; Integrated roadmap; Market routes; Technology management; Technology roadmap","Planning; Corporate Foresight; Innovation management; Roadmap; Technology managements; Technology roadmaps; Innovation; corporate strategy; innovation; management; technology; Russian Federation",,,,,"Reger, G., Technology foresight in companies: from an indicator to a network and process perspective (2001) Tech.

Focusing on government agencies, especially those supporting liberal democratic governments, the purpose of the current paper is to propose a new, practical, low-cost and high-return model for implementing a programmatic strategic foresight function that is collaboratively integrated with the organization’s existing policy, planning and intelligence functions. The paper describes the relevant organizational considerations and options for structural adjustments, and suggests how the proposed model can maximize decision-making effectiveness without disrupting pre-existing structures, operations and products. The paper further discusses the necessity and involvement of a central government foresight agency and a non-hierarchical distributed network linking the foresight units. Design/methodology/approach – Possible solutions are considered with respect to costs of development and implementation, risk (likelihood, consequence and uncertainty) of the new function’s failure, direct negative or positive effect on the performance of existing functions, the level of cross-organizational involvement in or collaboration with the new function, the level of cross-organization tangible benefits and the level of vertical involvement, especially at the executive level. Findings – With few exceptions, the implementation of foresight by governments has not been at all methodical, but has followed many different paths, where it has occurred at all. The approach proposed in this paper – establishing a central foresight agency, propagating individual agency-based small programmatic foresight units and virtual teams and creating a non-hierarchical distributed network to link all of them – appears to best meet the success criteria set out in the paper. Research limitations/implications – Governments, especially liberal democratic ones, and their agencies that have previously shied away from methodically implementing strategic foresight or that have attempted to do so without real success now have an approach that is likely to produce the desired results. Practical implications – The paper creates a sound framework for governments, especially liberal democratic ones, and their agencies to consider and proceed with the implementation of foresight functions and networks to support them. Originality/value – The proposed approach is entirely new and generally challenges current practices. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Intelligence; Planning; Policy; Public sector organizations; Strategic foresight; Virtual teams",,,,,,"Berze, O., (2014) Mapping foresight practices worldwide, , www.search-document.com/pdf/8/4/berze.htm, discussion paper, Strategic Innovation Lab, OCAD University; (2015) About the Army, , www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/about-army/organization.page, (accessed 3 April 2015); Chapman, B., Gizewski, P., (2013) Army 2040 Seminar-A Methodology to Address Capability Development in an Uncertain Future, , Canadian Army Land Warfare Centre, Ontario; Day, J., (2013) Review of Cross-Government Horizon Scanning, , www.google.ca/url?sa_t&rct_j&q_&esrc_s&source_web&cd_2&cad_rja&uact_8&ved_0CCUQFjAB&url_https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fpublications%2Freview-of-crossgovernment-horizon-scanning&ei_NaIcVbnfA8WqyASdiIKwCQ&usg_AFQjCNEHI8xqVvDxP3OVcq-OLS2Bn_I6lg&bvm_bv.89744112,d.aWw, Cabinet Office, London; Dreyer, I., Stang, G., Foresight in governments-practices and trends around the world (2013) Yearbook of European Security: YES 2013, , www.iss.europa.eu/publications/detail/article/euiss-yearbook-of-european-security-2013/, EU Institute for Security Studies, (accessed 29 May 2013); (2015) Strategic Foresight, , www.foresightcanada.ca/strategicforesight, (accessed 25 November 2014); Fuerth, L.S., Faber, E.M.H., (2012) Anticipatory Governance-Practical Upgrades, Project on Forward Engagement, Elliott School of International Affairs, , www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Anticipatory_Governance_Practical_Upgrades.pdf, The George Washington University, Washington, DC; (2015) Departments and Agencies, , www.canada.ca/en/gov/dept/index.html?utm_medium_decommissioned_site&utm_campaign_Canada_Site_Redirect_Tracking&utm_source_canada.gc.ca/depts/major/depind-eng.html&utm_content_Launch_Tracking, (accessed 26 November 2014); (2015) Members of Horizon Scanning Programme Groups, , www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/352238/Membership_of_the_CSAG_GOSH_CoIs_and_Roundtables_September_2014.pdf, (accessed 30 March); Habegger, B., (2009) Strategic Foresight: Anticipation and Capacity to Act, Center for Security Studies (CSS) Analyses in Security Policy, , www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CSSAnalyses-52.pdf, January; Hines, A., (2012) The Role of an Organizational Futurist in Integrating Foresight into Organizations-A Synthesis, , Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds; (2004) Science & Innovation Investment Framework 2004-2014, , HM Treasury, London; (2014) Government horizon scanning, , www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmsctech/703/70302.htm, Ninth Report of Session 2013-2014, House of Commons, London; Kuosa, T., (2011) Practicing Strategic Foresight in Government-the cases of Finland, Singapore and the European Union (monograph), , www.rsis.edu.sg/publications/monographs/Monograph19.pdf, S.

Foresight technology is the most appropriate one. The purpose of this article is to give a brief description of the foresight as a technology of foreseeing and identifying the most promising points of regional capacity, aimed at improving the competitiveness on the example of a particular region of the Russian Federation - the Republic of Adygea. The authors note that conducting the regional foresight project must be preceded by an analysis of economic, natural, innovative, and information-technological capacity of the region. The article reviews the methods for foresight, gives the characteristics of natural, economic, innovation and information-technological capacity of the Republic of Adygea. In the article the development problems of the region, uncertainty factors and trends of socio-economic changes in the republic have been identified. The implementation of the foresight project will allow to form the basis for social partnership of government, business and social community in order to better exploit opportunities and the implementation of the economic capacity of the region. © 2015, Econjournals.

This was a characterisation of population obesity in the United Kingdom at that time. The Foresight programme of different projects aimed to harness scientific evidence to the making of policy in a range of areas, obesity among them. An objective of this particular Foresight project was to 'de-silo' obesity policy by bringing together very diverse stakeholders, and to develop directives that recruited 'joined-up' government to the cause of obesity control. The Foresight process more generally was used to offer science-based solutions to complex problems. Obesity entered the sphere of complex problems that defied resolution that the Labour administration sought to deal with, along with inequality and climate change among others. The take-home message of the Foresight Obesities project was that the causes of obesity are embedded in an extremely complex biological system, set within an equally complex societal framework. While different forms of complexity have been argued for, the type of complexity favoured by Foresight was the one most commonly embraced, romantic, or upward-looking complexity that can be ordered at a more macro-level. This article describes the development of the FOSM and the process through which obesity policy and obesity research were reframed as complex problems. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","body size; complexity; economics; joined-up government; obesity policy",,,,,,"Joined up government in the western world in comparative perspective: A preliminary literature review and exploration (2004) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 14 (1), pp. 103-138. , 6, P; (2011) Obesity Policy in England, , Association for the Study of Obesity Deal, UK: Association for the Study of Obesity; Bluford, D.A.A., Sherry, B., Scanlon, K.S., Interventions to prevent or treat obesity in preschool children: A review of evaluated programs (2007) Obesity, 15 (6), pp. 1356-1372; Bogdanor, V., (2005) Joined-Up Government, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Buckley, W., (1967) Sociology and Modern Systems Theory, , New Jersey: Englewood Cliffs; Butland, B., (2007) Foresight: Tackling Obesities: Future Choices Project Report, , London: Government Office for Science; Charlesworth, J., (2006) Tackling Obesities: The Future of Obesity over the Next 50 Years, , http://www.jessicacharlesworth.com/2006/tacklingobesities/, accessed 13 June 2014; Chipperfield, T., O'Brien, R., Bolderson, T., Eidinow, E., Shafner, L., Parry, V., Visualising the future: Scenarios to 2050 (2007) Foresight Tackling Obesities: Future Choices, , http://www.foresight.gov.uk, accessed July 1 2014; Cole, T.J., Bellizzi, M.C., Flegal, K.M., Dietz, W.H., Establishing a standard definition for child overweight and obesity worldwide: International survey (2000) British Medical Journal, 320, pp. 1240-1245; (2008) Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: A Cross-Government Strategy for England, , Cross-Government Obesity Unit, Department of Health and Department of Children, Schools and Families London: Her Majesty's Government; (2010) White Paper: Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our Strategy for Public Health in England, , Department of Health London: Her Majesty's Government; (2012) An Update on the Government's Approach to Tackling Obesity, , Department of Health London: National Audit Office; Curry, A., Hodgson, T., Kelnar, R., Wilson, A., (2006) Intelligent Infrastructure Futures.

To date, reasonable practical experience has been accumulated, but there is a lack of a comprehensive conceptual approach for using strategic foresight and roadmapping to solve management problems. Design/methodology/approach – This approach integrates corporate strategic foresight and roadmapping in several stages. During the foresight phase, the authors create scenarios of long-term development determined by long-term macro trends and challenges to identify “points of growth” and system of priorities for company growth. A strategic roadmap enables the company to form a “corridor” for specific projects and create a long-term action plan to implement the priorities identified in the first phase. Using a project roadmap makes it possible to ensure the implementation of a specific project, defining a system of goals, the necessary measures, their timing and financing, as well as indicators to assess their effectiveness. Findings – The core result of the suggested methodology is a set of possible trajectories of innovation development, reflecting the whole technological chain involving R&D – technology – product – market. Each path involves a sequence of organizational actions and key decision-making points that are necessary to be taken to introduce new technological solutions and develop innovation products with new features to the customer/user. These routes support decision-making in such fields as the choice of the product line, establishment of new partnerships with developers of innovation technologies, decisions regarding “insourcing-outsourcing” and the requirements for relevant scientific and technological breakthroughs. It allows corporations to create strategies for commercializing innovation products. Originality/value – The methodology proposes to integrate the results of foresight studies and in roadmaps and finally in business planning, adopting innovative strategies and management decisions. It contributes to the development of common principles and approaches to the subject, while taking account of company-specific features that can significantly affect the decision-making mechanism. The methodology is applicable to foreign and Russian companies when creating innovative strategies and management decisions based on the results of foresight. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate foresight; Innovation; Integrated roadmapping; Strategic foresight; Technology route",,,,,,"Alsan, A., Corporate foresight in emerging markets: Action research at a multinational company in Turkey (2008) Futures, 40 (1), pp. 47-55; Battistella, C., The organisation of corporate foresight: A multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Becker, P., (2002) Corporate foresight in Europe: A first overview, , Working Paper European Commission, European Commission, Brussels; Bokov, M.B., Velikanova, N.P., Vishnevskiy, K., Edelkina, A., Klubova, M., Thurner, T., After 300 meters turn right-the future of Russia's GLONASS and the development of global satellite navigation systems (2014) Foresight, 16 (5), pp. 448-461; Carayannis, E.G., Alexander, J., Is technological learning a firm core competence, when, how and why?

This study extends the existing literature on dynamic capabilities in service innovation by operationalizing the capabilities of sensing and seizing new opportunities. The purpose of this chapter is to examine how futures thinking and design thinking can facilitate service innovation from the dynamic capabilities point-of-view. As a result this chapter provides a conceptual framework for service innovation process that is grounded on foresight and service design. To synthesize the literature into a new conceptual framework, this chapter is based on a large body of literature from four burgeoning fields of study: Dynamic capabilities, service innovation, foresight, and service design. The key point the chapter wishes to make is that a forward look at new methodological perspectives in service innovation is needed and that integrating the methods and tools of foresight and service design to the service innovation process provides a promising new avenue to future success. © Springer-Verlag London 2015.","Dynamic capabilities; Foresight; Service design; Service innovation",,,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Sanders, T.I., Complexity as a sensemaking framework for methodology (2005) Complexity as a Sensemaking Framework, pp. 21-37. , Aaltonen M, Barth T, Casti JL, Mitleton-Kelly E, Sanders TI, FFRC-publications 4/2005, Finland Futures Research Centre, Turku; Albright, K.S., Environmental scanning: Radar for success (2004) Inform Manag J, 38 (3), pp. 38-45; Agarwal, R., Selen, W., Dynamic capability building in service value networks for achieving service innovation (2009) Decis Sci, 40 (3), pp. 431-475; Alstyne, G., (2010) How We Learned to Pluralize the Future: Foresight Scenarios as Design Thinking, pp. 69-91. , Shamiyeh (ed) Creating desired futures—how design thinking innovates business.

In addition, each player has an independent probability to observe the opponent's foresight ability. We show that if this probability is not too close to 0 or 1, then the game admits an evolutionarily stable strategy, in which agents who look one step ahead and agents who look three steps ahead coexist. Moreover, this is the unique evolutionarily stable strategy in which players play efficiently at early stages of the interaction. We interpret our results as a novel evolutionary foundation for limited foresight and as a new mechanism to induce cooperation in the repeated prisoner's dilemma. © 2015 Yuval Heller.","Limit Ess; Limited Foresight; Prisoner's Dilemma",,,,,,"Andreoni, J., Miller, J.H., Rational cooperation in the finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma: Experimental evidence (1993) Economic Journal, 103, pp. 570-585; Axelrod, R.M., (1984) The Evolution of Cooperation, , Basic Books, New York; Bendor, J., Swistak, P., The evolutionary stability of cooperation (1997) American Political Science Review, 91, pp. 290-307; Binmore, K.G., Samuelson, L., Evolutionary stability in repeated games played by finite automata (1992) Journal of Economic Theory, 57, pp. 278-305; Bolton, G.E., The rationality of splitting equally (1997) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 32, pp. 365-381; Bruttel, L.V., Güth, W., Kamecke, U., Finitely repeated prisoners' dilemma experiments without a commonly known end (2012) International Journal of Game Theory, 41, pp. 23-47; Camerer, C.F., (2003) Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Cooper, R., DeJong, D.V., Forsythe, R., Ross, T.W., Cooperation without reputation: Experimental evidence from prisoner's dilemma games (1996) Games and Economic Behavior, 12, pp. 187-218; Costa-Gomes, M., Crawford, V.P., Broseta, B., Cognition and behavior in normal-form games: An experimental study (2001) Econometrica, 69, pp. 1193-1235; Crawford, V.P., Lying for strategic advantage: Rational and boundedly rational misrepresentation of intentions (2003) American Economic Review, 93, pp. 133-149; Cressman, R., Local stability of smooth selection dynamics for normal form games (1997) Mathematical Social Sciences, 34, pp. 1-19; Dekel, E., Ely, J.C., Yilankaya, O., Evolution of preferences (2007) Review of Economic Studies, 74, pp. 685-704; Fudenberg, D., Maskin, E., Evolution and cooperation in noisy repeated games (1990) American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings, 80, pp. 274-279; Geanakoplos, J., Gray, L., When seeing further is not seeing better (1991) Bulletin of the Santa Fe Institute, 6, pp. 4-9; Haviland, W.A., Prins, H., Walrath, D., McBride, B., (2007) Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge, , Wadsworth, Belmont; Heller, Y., Stability and trembles in extensive-form games (2014) Games and Economic Behavior, 84, pp. 132-136; Jehiel, P., Limited foresight may force cooperation (2001) Review of Economic Studies, 68, pp. 369-391; Johnson, E.J., Camerer, C., Sen, S., Rymon, T., Detecting failures of backward induction: Monitoring information search in sequential bargaining (2002) Journal of Economic Theory, 104, pp. 16-47; Kim, Y.-G., Evolutionary stability in the asymmetric war of attrition (1993) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 161, pp. 13-21; Kim, Y.-G., Evolutionarily stable strategies in the repeated prisoner's dilemma (1994) Mathematical Social Sciences, 28, pp. 167-197; Kraines, D., Kraines, V., Pavlov and the prisoner's dilemma (1989) Theory and Decision, 26, pp. 47-79; Kreps, D.M., Wilson, R., Sequential equilibria (1982) Econometrica, 50, pp. 863-894; Kreps, D.M., Milgrom, P., Roberts, J., Wilson, R., Rational cooperation in the finitely repeated prisoners' dilemma (1982) Journal of Economic Theory, 27, pp. 245-252; Leimar, O., Repeated games: A state space approach (1997) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 184, pp. 471-498; Lorberbaum, J., No strategy is evolutionarily stable in the repeated prisoner's dilemma (1994) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 168, pp. 117-130; Lorberbaum, J.P., Bohning, D.E., Shastri, A., Sine, L.E., Are there really no evolutionarily stable strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma?

And yet is it the purpose of foresight studies to provide highly detailed analyses and to predict or produce the future in a precise way? Surely not, says Georges Amar, or at least not exclusively. As he suggests in this article, the important thing today in the foresight field is ""rather, to open up the future, to give it some air, some room for manoeuvre."" That is why Amar argues here for a non-predictive form of foresight, more focussed on the paradigm shifts that are likely to happen and on the possibilities opened up by the emerging paradigms. In support of his argument, Georges Amar draws on the paradigm shifts underway in the transport world (the emergence of the ""transmodal"", ""mobile life"" etc.) and their socio-economic effects (in terms of usage, and tools and resources, but also on the actors in the sector). Understood in this way, this foresight approach, which he describes as ""conceptive"", enables new cognitive resources to be identified, offering a fertile, open future both for the actors of today and for future generations.",,,,,,,"(2010) Homo Mohilis.

Design/methodology/approach – Part I provides a sketch of investigations of change and related areas of uncertainty and discontinuity. Part II provides a conceptual framework outlining four types of change: incremental, contextual, structural and foundational. Part III outlines the methodological distinctions required to explore the four types of change characterized here as normal and extraordinary foresight. Part IV combines these examinations to develop a structured approach to scenario analysis. Finally, Part V examines the implications of this work. Findings – A structured approach to scenario planning explores four variations of evolutionary and revolutionary changes. It applies both normal and extraordinary foresight to explore the epistemological and ontological boundaries of change and to analyze the impact of shifts in ontological boundaries. While a structured approach applies established tools and techniques, it also directs our attention to areas where we can do more. It is an integral part of strategic foresight in a changing world. Research limitations/implications – This is a conceptual article based on over 25 years of practice in corporate strategy, including 10 years of work in scenario planning. It is also drawn from doctoral research on the epistemological and ontological boundaries of paradigms (Wayland, 2003), as outlined in Thomas S. Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Kuhn and Hacking, 2012). Originality/value – Recent work examining the epistemological and ontological boundaries of change are linked with a practical framework and methodological distinction. These contributions are combined with a structured approach to scenario planning to improve the ability to anticipate and to plan for change. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change; Discontinuity; Extraordinary foresight; Normal foresight; Ontological; Paradigm",,,,,,"Baltas, A., Gavroglu, K., Kindi, V., A discussion with Thomas S.

Design/methodology/approach – The two courses “Introductory Statistics with R” and “Statistics and Foresight” are designed to provide an introduction to quantitative methods in the social sciences with specific applications to social foresight. In particular, the first course introduces students to data analysis providing the necessary tools to study and represent socio-economic phenomena through graphical summaries and numerical measures. During the course, example applications based on the use of the open-source software R are shown. At the end, the students should be able to perform data management, conduct descriptive analysis of categorical and quantitative variables and analyze bivariate distributions. The subsequent course “Statistics and Foresight” presents the most efficient methods to make decisions in a context of uncertainty while visualizing the potential errors of wrong decisions and computing the probability of their occurrence. Findings – This paper is a description of an interesting and promising way of teaching applied statistics in social sciences. Practical implications – With the main aim of learning the correct use of statistics, specific attention is devoted to the use and interpretation of the aforementioned methods rather than to their theoretical aspects. Even in the second course, an important role is played by the treatment of real data by the use of the R software. Originality/value – This paper attempts to systematize a method of teaching statistics based on the practical use of open-source software. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Open-source software; Social foresight; Statistics; Teaching methods",,,,,,"Agresti, A., Franklin, C., (2014) Statistics: The Art & Science of Learning from Data, , Pearson Education, Harlow; Born, M., Einsteins statistical theories” (1949) Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist, , in Schilpp, P.A.

However, no study to date has assessed whether these neurocognitive difficulties extend to the ability to mentally time travel into one's personal future. This is a surprising omission given that executive control and episodic memory are considered to be critical for episodic foresight. In addition, opiate-related brain changes have been identified in the neural regions that underlie the capacity for episodic foresight. Objective: In the present study, we assessed how episodic foresight is affected in the context of chronic opiate use, as well as the degree to which any deficits are related to difficulties with executive control and episodic memory. Methods and Results: Forty-eight long-term heroin users enrolled in an opiate substitution program and 48 controls were tested. The results showed that, relative to controls, the clinical group exhibited significant impairment in episodic foresight but not episodic memory (as indexed by an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview). For executive function, the clinical group was impaired on only one of three measures (Inhibition). Conclusions: These data provide important preliminary evidence that episodic foresight might be particularly susceptible to the neurocognitive effects of opiate use, as the difficulties identified were not secondary to more general executive control or episodic memory impairment. Because a number of widely used relapse prevention protocols require the ability to mentally project into the future, these data have potentially important practical implications in relation to the treatment of substance dependence disorders. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Autobiographical Interview; Episodic foresight; Episodic memory; Executive functions; Opiate users","buprenorphine plus naloxone; diamorphine; methadone; naloxone; opiate; adult; Article; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; disease association; disease predisposition; disease severity; episodic foresight deficit; episodic memory; executive function; female; heroin dependence; human; male; memory disorder; opiate addiction; opiate substitution treatment; priority journal; complication; drug effects; drug use; executive function; Memory Disorders; middle aged; Opioid-Related Disorders; physiology; psychology; time factor; Adult; Drug Users; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Memory Disorders; Memory, Episodic; Middle Aged; Opioid-Related Disorders; Time Factors",,"diamorphine, 1502-95-0, 561-27-3; methadone, 1095-90-5, 125-56-4, 23142-53-2, 297-88-1, 76-99-3; naloxone, 357-08-4, 465-65-6; opiate, 53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4",,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Age-related changes in the episodic simulation of future events (2008) Psychol Sci, 19, pp. 33-41; Arbuthnott, K., Frank, J., Trail Making Test, part B as a measure of executive control: Validation using a set-switching paradigm (2000) J Clin Exp Neuropsychol, 22, pp. 518-528. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3cvnt1yhsw%3D%3D 10923061; Arnold, K.M., McDermott, K.B., Szpunar, K.K., Imaging the near and far future: The role of location familiarity (2011) Mem Cogn, 39, pp. 954-967; (2001) Australian Alcohol Guidelines: Health Risks and Benefits, , Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Commonwealth of Australia Canberra; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., (1999) Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW): Stimuli, Instruction Manual and Affective Ratings Technical Report C-1. the Center for Research in Psychophysiology, , University of Florida Gainesville; Brown, A.D., Addis, D.R., Romano, T.A., Marma, C.R., Bryant, R.A., Hirst, W., Schacter, D.L., Episodic and semantic components of autobiographical memories and imagined future events in post-traumatic stress disorder (2014) Memory, 22 (6), pp. 595-604; Buckner, R.L., Carroll, D.C., Self-projection and the brain (2006) TRENDS Cogn Sc, 11, pp. 49-57; Burgess, P.W., Shallice, T., (1997) The Hayling and Brixton Tests.

The Critical Path Method (CPM) is the most widely used modeling method in construction due to its simplicity. Discrete-event simulation is more versatile than CPM and is well suited to modeling manufacturing processes since these tend to be repetitive, but it lacks the simplicity in use of CPM and thus has not been widely adopted in construction. This paper demonstrates an alternative modelling approach, Foresight, developed to provide the modeling versatility of simulation, and yet be relatively simple to use and visually insightful. Previous work demonstrated the application of Foresight to in-place construction work and compared its performance to conventional simulation. This paper extends this work, demonstrating the application of Foresight to manufactured construction processes whereby streams of jobs, with design variances, are executed within a factory. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Manufacture; Turnaround time; Construction works; Critical path method; Key process; Manufactured constructions; Manufacturing process; Model construction; Model method; Planning and control; Discrete event simulation",,,,,"Ceric, V., Hierarchical abilities of diagrammatic representations of discrete-event simulation models (1994) Proceedings of the 1994 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 589-594. , edited by J.

Future-oriented information is gathered by various agents, but firms still struggle to find relevant information and transform it into profitable businesses and innovations. Intermediary organisations play an important role in the interfacing of knowledge producers and knowledge exploiters. This paper studies the role of intermediary organisations in promoting the use of foresight information in small and medium-sized enterprises. A qualitative case study approach is used. The study emphasises the importance of interpreting foresight information through communicative processes and combines these ideas at the system level, providing new insights not only on the theoretical level but also for developing the innovation policy practice.

Design/methodology/approach-This paper is based on a multiple case study of major firms of the energy and the mobile communication industries. Findings-The focus is on strategic foresight and organizational flexibility: the author introduces the concept of “boundary uncertainty” and investigates its managerial implications. Originality/value-The main contribution of this paper is to expand our understanding of environmental uncertainty and to reinvigorate the study of strategic decision making in turbulent industries. The author provides descriptive data on the foresight approaches that some of the world’s largest and most influential companies used throughout the 2000s for remaining aligned with their fast-paced environments, and thus informs the debate between the “planning” and the “learning” schools of strategic management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental uncertainty; Flexibility; Strategic decision making; Strategic foresight; Strategic management; Uncertainty management; Volatility",,,,,,"Adner, R., When are technologies disruptive?

The world of the future will demand capacities that currently comprise mere options. There will be a need for new ways of thinking, planning, directing, communicating and managing; with a critical component common to them all-'anticipatory leadership'. Quintessentially, such leadership relates to the future and is concerned with transforming the 'mind-set' of those engaged in policy formulation and plan implementation. Our concept-oriented paper seeks to identify five linking 'anticipatory literacies': Awareness; Authenticity; Audacity; Adaptability; and Action. It concludes with a call to the Professional Futures Community and the world's leading Business Schools to collaborate in creating a 'Grand Transformation' in their collective mind-sets inspired by Anticipatory Leadership through Strategic Foresight.","Anticipatory leadership; Futures; Linked literacies; Strategic foresight",,,,,,"(1925) Science And The Modern World, , New York: Macmillan.

The country's plans to further research and innovation in the sector impact the world energy outlook. The paper examines the energy block of the Russian SandT Foresight 2030, developed by experts in 2011-2013 and approved by the Prime minister in January 2014. The official document, which covers six areas, including 'Energy efficiency and energy saving', defines the key science and technology (SandT) areas Russia has to embark upon in order to boost its competitiveness. The energy part of the study covers global challenges, threats, and opportunities for Russia, prospective innovative markets for its products and services. Moreover, Russia's innovative technologies and products are assessed, including the potential demand and competition aspects and benchmarking against global leaders. The paper features major outcomes of the energy block and puts the exercise in a comparative perspective with similar international studies of Kazakhstan, Germany, Canada, the UK, USA and international organizations. The author concludes that in Russia energy efficiency and energy saving priorities dominate the policy agenda, with relatively little attention to advancing renewable energy technologies. The Foresight horizon is also markedly shorter than that of similar studies in the OECD countries. Following international practice, in 2015 Russia plans to perform a new government-led SandT Foresight for the energy sector alone. © 2015 The Authors.

Services are likely to have an increasing role in the FBS in the future. Design/methodology/approach – The findings are based on a literature review of FBS outlook studies, strategies and programs and services-related studies in FBS and general services literature. Three case examples of services businesses in FBS companies are presented, and possible foresight approaches related to them are discussed. Foresight methods used in parallel sectors are also discussed. Findings – The study provides the first systematic introduction, classification and review of FBS services to include both industry- and non-industry-related services. The paper also points out the need for foresight studies and suggests various approaches for an analysis of the potential of FBS services in the future bioeconomy. Practical implications – The study shows that the role of services in FBS research has been understood too narrowly. As a result, services research has been rather lacking and the future potential of services in the FBS has not been fully acknowledged. The study argues for and points toward the need to use foresight approaches to update FBS strategies, business models and policies to fully benefit from the future potential of services. Originality/value – The study is a novel introduction, review and discussion of the role of services in the FBS and their future outlook. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Foresight; ForeST-BASED SECtor (FBS); Outlook; Services",,,,,,"Ali-Yrkkö, J., Rouvinen, P., (2013) Implications of value creation and capture in global value chains-lessons from 39 grassroots cases, 20p. , ETLA Reports No. 16, 19 August 2013; Ali-Yrkkö, J., Rouvinen, P., Ylä-Anttila, P., Who captures value in global supply chains?

This attitude appears in education and economy, issues in which Finland is highly competitive in Europe. We introduce the futures studiesrelated organizations and the foresight system of Finland. An overview of the development of futures studies and the activities, purposes of foresight institutions, with a major emphasis on the Finland Futures Research Centre will be presented. The main question is how could other countries utilize the Finnish example? Societal changes depend on the environment and its historical background, making it quite a challenge to come up with an all-adaptable answer for this question.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors firstly question the limits of plausibility from an ontological and epistemological perspective to expand scenarios beyond the boundaries of end-states. To incorporate ongoing changes in scenario methodology, the authors propose to explore scenario transformations within the conceptual framework of action-based scenarios. Findings – The authors discuss consequences of playing strategies within ongoing scenarios, as well as the research directions about moving scales, stakeholders’ dominance and time issues. Originality/value – The paper proposes a method to distort and transform scenarios. The authors suggest supplementing strategic foresight in iterative processes to challenge the boundaries of plausible futures, bridging the gap between theoretical ever-changing processes and the moving rhythms of actions. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Action; Methodology; Movement; Scenarios; Transformation",,,,,,"Aunger, R., Major transitions in ‘big’ history (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74 (8), pp. 1137-1163; Baburoglu, O., The vortical environment: the fifth in the emery-trist levels of organizational environments (1988) Human Relations, 41 (3), pp. 181-210; Berger, G., Sciences humaines et prevision (1957) La revue des deux Mondes, 3 (1), pp. 3-12; Berger, G., (1964) Phénoménologie du temps et prospective, , PUFParis:; Bergson, H., (1938) La pensée et le mouvant, , PUFParis:; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: an overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Bradley MacKay, R., Costanzo, L.A., Costonzo, L.A., Bradley MacKay, R., Introduction (2009) Handbook of Research on Strategy and Foresight, pp. 1-12. , ”in(Eds)Edward ElgarCheltenham:; Burt, G., Why are we surprised at surprises?

In order to utilize such ICT-based support systems fully, decision makers need suitable training. This paper proposes and evaluates the use of a Forecasting and Foresight Support System in an undergraduate course in business forecasting, so as to amplify the learning effect. The system provides a simple implementation of the forecasting process via realistic business scenarios that utilize both quantitative and qualitative information. Classical operational forecasting related features, as well as elements of a foresight nature, are considered during an exercise, so as to enhance user experience in terms of collaboration and communication. The system's acceptance and perceived educational effects are determined through responses to a purpose-built questionnaire. The results are very encouraging in terms of the final amplification of the learning effect. © 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.","Decision support system; Forecasting course; Hierarchies; Judgmental forecasts; Reconciliation; Training system",,,,,,"Armstrong, J.S., Collopy, F., Integration of statistical methods and judgment for time series forecasting: principles from empirical research (1998) Forecasting with judgment, pp. 269-293. , John Wiley, Chichester, G.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a reconstruction of the guiding ideas that have been used for designing the social foresight course. Findings – As far as anticipation is concerned, the authors’ understanding of anticipation is still cursory, and the novelty of the perspective may conceal the difficulty implied by this otherwise refreshingly new vision. The theory is at such an early phase of development that it still lacks a unified conceptual language for theorizing and operationalizing anticipation to facilitate cross-disciplinary conversations. Originality/value – The ability to anticipate in complex environments may improve the resilience of societies under threat from a global proliferation of agents and forces by articulating insecurities through anticipatory processes. However, to achieve this end, the joint expertise and theoretical awareness of both the futurists and the human and social scientists is needed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Abstract future; Anticipation; Futures literacy; Latent; Risk; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Adam, B., Groves, C., (2007) Future Matters, , Brill, Leiden; Amara, R., The futures field: Searching for definitions and boundaries (1981) The Futurist, 15 (1), pp. 25-29; Appadurai, A., (2013) The Future as Cultural Fact, , Verso, London; Beckert, J., Imagined futures: Fictional expectations in the economy (2013) Theory and Society, 42 (3), pp. 219-240; Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies, , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick & London; Berthoz, A., (2003) La De=Cision, , Odile Jacob, Paris; De Jouvenel, B., The Art of Conjecture (1967) Basic Books, , New York, NY; Guyer, J.I., Prophecy and the near future: Thoughts on macroeconomic, evangelical, and punctuated time (2007) American Ethnologist, 34 (3), pp. 409-421; Han, C., The work of indebtness: The traumatic present of late capitalist Chile (2004) Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry, 28 (2), pp. 169-187; Inayatullah, S., (2004) The Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) Reader, , Tamkang University, Tamsui; Knight, F.H., (1921) Risk, Uncertainty and Profit, Hart, , Schaffner & Marx, Boston, MA; Louie, A.H., (2009) More than Life Itself, , Ontos Verlag, Frankfurt; Louie, A.H., Poli, R., The spread of hierarchical cycles (2011) International Journal of General Systems, 40 (3), pp. 237-261; Luhmann, N., (1982) The Differentiation of Society, , Columbia University Press, New York, NY; Meadows, D., (1999) Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System, , http://goo.gl/8RYwn; Miller, R., (2006) From Trends to Futures Literacy: Reclaiming the Future, , Centre for Strategic Education, Melbourne; Miller, R., Futures literacy: A hybrid strategic scenario method (2007) Futures, 39 (4), pp. 341-362; Miller, R., Anticipation: The discipline of uncertainty (2012) The Future of Futures, , in Curry, A.

This paper aims to present an integrated foresight framework customized for designing a technology and innovation platform and defining a strategic R,D&I Agenda for oncological drugs in Brazil. This framework encompassed: (i) development of technological roadmaps, looking for technological and market bottlenecks and opportunities for this segment in the period of 2013 to 2030; (ii) identification of local distinctive competences concerning four categories of oncological drugs - chemotherapy; hormone therapy; immunotherapy; and argeted therapies; (iii) establishment of strategic R,D&I portfolios for each category, considering local distinctive competences versus strategic importance for the Brazilian health system; and (iv) strategic roadmapping for designing the technology innovation platform for oncological drugs, considering three distinct time horizons. From this experience, one can conclude that: (i) the integrated foresight framework was demonstrated to be effective for designing a technology and innovation platform for oncological drugs in Brazil; (ii) the most promising local opportunities for cooperative R,D&I projects in this pharmaceutical segment could be identified; and (iii) it was possible to establish conditions for replication of this foresight framework at sectorial level for other drugs segments.

With the emergence of diverse technologies each day, the importance of future studies has become clearer than ever before. Technology foresight is an integral part of decision and policy making at the top level of governance, especially in countries with governmental economics such as Iran which is one of such countries with complicated economic and governmental systems in many areas. For Iran as a developing country, one of the most important sections of technology foresight is planning and decision making on R&D project selection. The present study focuses on introducing a new line in this part of future studies in the country. To this end, a model is established and SWARA method is applied for evaluating the model. SWARA is a new effective MADM method for evaluating criteria at the top level of decision and policy making bodies. The most important part of this study is about identifying the importance of criteria and sub-criteria of the established model for R&D projects selection in Iran. This research proposes a general framework for starting a new horizon in research activities in Iran. © 2015, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Time banks are particularly interesting for the future of services: they address all sorts of services while the time-bank “value” of these different types of services does not necessarily reflect their actual value in the free market; impacts may spread from the mere coverage of people’s needs, to increased social capital and community empowerment; and some scholars consider them as flexible forms of co-production, or even as enablers of wider social change. The purpose of the paper is to examine the emergence, and features of the time banks created during the recent financial crisis in Greece as grass-roots initiatives. Design/methodology/approach – Primary information and data were gathered through eight extensive face-to-face interviews with key members of the four time banks based on a semi-structured questionnaire. The methodology also included desk research and review of the information included in time banks’ websites. The selection of these four time banks was based on the fact that they are the most active ones in Athens, which is the capital of the country gathering around 40 per cent of the Greek population and presenting the severest consequences of the financial crises in terms of unemployment, poverty, shutdown of businesses, share of people with no insurance, etc. Findings – Based on a specific analytical framework summarising the available literature, the Greek time banks are compared with each other but also in relation to the findings in the literature, where some interesting differences emerge. The paper also explores the role that foresight can plan in the development of alternative initiatives like time banks. The interesting conclusion is that foresight can help time banks as much as time banks can help foresight in upgrading its processes to deal with challenges of the twenty-first century. Research limitations/implications – The research focuses on the four most active time banks in Athens. While this selection is justified, future research would be good to include all the time banks in Greece. Social implications – The paper explores how time banks in Greece emerged as well as how they can further develop. This is of direct relevance to society as time banks are by default a community initiative. Originality/value – Time banks in Greece have not been previously studied. Second, time banks in general were never linked to approaches like foresight. This becomes increasingly important in examining possible approaches toward more sustainable and resilient societies. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Co-production; Foresight; Time banks",,,,,,"Allen, J., Barlow, J., Leal, J., Maloutas, T., Padovani, T., (2004) Housing and Welfare in Southern Europe Blackwell, , Wiley, London; Amanatidou, E., (2013) Foresight unplugged beyond any official targets, foresight is bound to serve democracy, , paper presented at the European IFA Academic Seminar, Participatory Foresight for Smarter Futures-From Design to Impact, 16-19 September, ZHAW, Technopark Winterthur (Zurich); Barré, R., Keenan, M., Evaluation, impact and learning: Theme 2-anchor paper (2006) Second International Seville Seminar on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis: Impact of FTA Approaches on Policy and Decision-Making, , Seville, 28-29 September; Bovaird, T., Beyond engagement and participation: Users and community co-production of services (2007) Public Administration Review, 67 (5), pp. 846-860; Boyle, D., Time as currency (1999) Voluntary Action Journal, 1 (3); Boyle, D., (2005) Sustainability and social assets: The potential of time banks and co-production, Grassroots Initiatives for Sustainable Development 10 June 2005, , www.mitimebanks.org/wp-content/uploads/Sustainability-and-social-assets-David-Boyle-2005.pdf, (accessed 21 May 2014); Boyle, D., Harris, M.T., (2009) The Challenge of Co-Production, , NESTA, London; Burns, S., New economy, new equality (2000) New Economy, 7 (2); Cahn, E., (2000) No More Throwaway People: The Co-production Imperative, , Essential Books, WA; Cahn, E., Rowe, J., (1992) Time Dollars: The New Currency That Enables Americans to Turn Their Hidden Resource-Time-Into Personal Security & Community Renewal, , Rodale Press, Emmaus, PA; Callison, S., All you need is love?

Children's memory for which room had toys and which room did not was explicitly assessed. Children were then queried about where they should place a new set of toys for their next visit to the rooms. In Experiment 1, where children were asked about the ""distant"" future, 4- and 5-year-olds, but not 3-year-olds, placed the toys in the ""no-toy"" room at a rate significantly higher than chance. In Experiment 2, where children were asked about the ""immediate"" future, correct responses of 3-year-olds were still no different from chance, those of 5-year-olds were above chance, and those of 4-year-olds trended in this direction. Our discussion centers on the importance of assessing both ""memory"" and ""foresight"" on tasks purported to assess children's episodic foresight, the role of ""temporal distance"" on children's future-oriented behavior, and implications for future research. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive development; Episodic foresight; Memory; Planning; Preschoolers; Temporal distance","age; child psychology; female; forecasting; human; male; preschool child; problem solving; thinking; Age Factors; Child, Preschool; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Male; Problem Solving; Psychology, Child; Thinking",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., Preschoolers' current desires warp their choices for the future (2006) Psychological Science, 17, pp. 583-587; Atance, C.M., Sommerville, J.A., Assessing the role of memory in preschoolers' performance on episodic foresight tasks (2014) Memory, 22, pp. 118-128; Busby Grant, J., Suddendorf, T., Production of temporal terms by 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children (2011) Early Childhood Research Quarterly, 26, pp. 87-95; D'Argembeau, A.D., Renaud, O., Van der Linden, M., Frequency, characteristics, and functions of future-oriented thoughts in daily life (2011) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 25, pp. 96-103; D'Argembeau, A., Van der Linden, M., Phenomenal characteristics associated with projecting oneself back into the past and forward into the future: Influence of valence and temporal distance (2004) Consciousness and Cognition, 13, pp. 844-858; Friedman, W.J., Children's knowledge of the future distances of daily activities and annual events (2002) Journal of Cognition and Development, 3, pp. 333-356; Gilbert, D.T., Killingsworth, M.A., Eyre, R.N., Wilson, T.D., The surprising power of neighborly advice (2009) Science, 323, pp. 1617-1619; Hudson, J.A., Mayhew, E., Prabhakar, J., The development of episodic foresight: Emerging concepts and methods (2011) Advances in Child Development and Behavior, 40, pp. 95-137; Nelson, K., Fivush, R., The emergence of autobiographical memory: A social cultural developmental theory (2004) Psychological Review, 111, pp. 486-511; Premack, D., Human and animal cognition: Continuity and discontinuity (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104, pp. 13861-13867; Raby, C.R., Alexis, D.M., Dickinson, A., Clayton, N.S., Planning for the future by western scrub-jays (2007) Nature, 445, pp. 919-921; Raby, C.R., Clayton, N.S., Prospective cognition in animals (2009) Behavioural Processes, 80, pp. 314-324; Redshaw, J., Suddendorf, T., Foresight beyond the very next event: Four-year-olds can link past and deferred future episodes (2013) Frontiers in Psychology, 4, p. 404; Richmond, J.L., Pan, R., Thinking about the future early in life: The role of relational memory (2013) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 114, pp. 510-521; Russell, J., Alexis, D., Clayton, N.S., Episodic future thinking in 3- to 5-year-old children: The ability to think of what will be needed from a different point of view (2010) Cognition, 114, pp. 56-71; Scarf, D., Gross, J., Colombo, M., Hayne, H., To have and to hold: Episodic memory in 3- and 4-year-old children (2013) Developmental Psychobiology, 55, pp. 125-132; Schacter, D.L., Addis, D.R., Buckner, R.L., Episodic simulation of future events: Concepts, data, and applications (2008) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1124, pp. 39-60; Suddendorf, T., Busby, J., Making decisions with the future in mind: Developmental and comparative identification of mental time travel (2005) Learning and Motivation, 36, pp. 110-125; Suddendorf, T., Corballis, M.C., Mental time travel and the evolution of the human mind (1997) Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs, 123, pp. 133-167; Suddendorf, T., Corballis, M.C., The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel, and is it unique to humans?

A case study was carried out in the field of life science. Recombinant DNA (RbDNA) and Monoclonal Antibody (mAb) were selected as impelling technologies to carry out the case study. ELISA Diagnosis (ELISA) and Fermentation Technology (FT) were defined as non-impelling technologies to be control group. Results revealed that impelling technologies have higher evolving rates from the stage of growth to maturity. Significant policies or programs usually boost the rapid progress of impelling technologies. Impelling technologies have much higher impact than non-impelling ones. Collaboration behaviour is much more broad and general for impelling technologies.

Emerging technologies have been shaping the future of some industries and transforming many others. In many cases, these technologies will determine the restructuring of industries as never before. Specially designed for enabling better planning and future decisions, technology foresight (TF) methods are used to foresee diffusion of innovations, mapping out commercially viable roadmaps for technological development. This paper is concerned with a methodological instrument adopted in Brazil as support for building the Agenda for a National Innovation Initiative (NII), which was articulated by government, universities, R&D institutions, and private firms. It presents and discusses an integrated methodological approach for a TF study, specially designed for the purpose of this Brazilian innovation policy instrument, concerning three emerging technologies – nanotechnology, biotechnology, and information and communication technologies (ICT). © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.","Biotechnology; Brazil; Emerging technologies; Information and communication technologies; Nanotechnology; National innovation initiative; National innovation system; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Adler, M., Ziglio, E., (1996) Gazing into the Oracle, , Jessica Kingsley Publishers, Bristol; Albright, R.E., Kappel, T.A., Roadmapping in the corporation (2003) Research Technology Management, 46, pp. 31-40; Almeida, M.F.L., Sustentabilidade corporativa, inovação tecnológica e planejamento adaptativo: Dos princípios à ação (2006) Doctoral Dissertation (Production Engineering).

Moreover this activity has no institutional frameworks. This article reviews past efforts in this field in South Africa. In the end of 1990s, the Department of Arts Culture, Science and Technology announced the results of the National Research and Technology Foresight. One of the key implications of these results was that, in contrast to the rest of the world, South African stakeholders fail to recognize the importance of emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, micro-production as well as simulation technologies as cost-effective components of new product and process development. These results appear to have permeated the STI policy and as a result, the country appears to be lagging in terms of research in emerging technologies. The main focus of the authors is on the findings of the most recent effort supported by the Department of Trade and Industry to identify changes in industrialists' opinions related to technology priorities. The recent results indicate that the country is integrating into the global economy, as national priorities are converging with priorities elsewhere.","Foresight; National innovation system; Science and technology (S&T) priorities; South Africa",,,,,,"Blankley, O.W., Pouris, A., Identification of strategic priority areas in technology development (1993) South African Journal of Science, 89, p. 169; DACST, (1996) White Paper on Science and Technology: Preparing for the 21st Century, , Pretoria: Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology; DACST, (2001) Foresight Synthesis Report: Dawn of a New Century, , Pretoria: Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology; DTI, (2004) Benchmarking of Technology Trends and Technology Developments, , Pretoria: Department of Trade & Industry; DST, (2015) Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2015-2020, , Pretoria: Department of Science and Technology; Georghiou, L., Keenan, M., Evaluation of national foresight activities: Assessing rationale, process and impact (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73, pp. 761-777; Government Office for Science, (2010) Technology and Innovation Futures: UK Growth Opportunities for the 2020s, , http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/foresight/docs/general-publications/10-1252-technology-and-innovation-futures.pdf, London: Foresight Horizon Scanning Centre, Government Office for Science, accessed 07.05.2015; Havas, A., Schartinger, D., Weber, M., The impact of foresight on innovation policy-making: Recent experiences and future perspectives (2010) Research Evaluation, 19 (2), pp. 91-104; Hewitt, K., The future of U.

In order to address this goal, Delphi forecasting method was utilized in the Polish-nationwide study with 150 invited experts. Paper presents results of research project dealing with development of directions of road pavement technologies with regards to the environmental aspects. As a result of the analyses, it was concluded that binding materials with improved viscoelastic range (often with modifications) would continue to play a leading role. Furthermore, according to the experts, the technologies that enable to monitor the state of road pavement in a continuous manner will be used to a greater range. Introduction of sensors into the pavement network will lead to the construction of ""smart"" roads while the spread of nanomaterial technologies in road construction will improve the durability and reliability of road pavement construction. © 2015 The Authors.

However, informing the public about what the future holds based on the development of S&T is an equally important role of TF. Since the introduction of the first TF in 1994, Korea has conducted four such studies. TF in Korea has become a key process in setting S&T policy, such as the Science and Technology Basic Plan (S&T Basic Plan). The S&T Basic Plan determines the national strategic technologies by ref lecting on future technology. The S&T Basic Plan is a mandatory legal planning process established every five years by the Korean government. It is the top-level policy document affecting S&T-related policy making in Korea. TF in Korea primarily utilizes the Delphi method. The third and fourth TFs have strengthened the links between S&T and society by determining future technologies capable of solving future needs. The fourth TF presented scenarios and special illustrations to show members of the public the future technologies and their implications for society. Additionally, the fourth round of TF analyzed the potential negative impacts of future technologies.","Delphi method; S&T strategies; Science and technology (S&T) policy; Technology assessment; Technology Foresight",,,,,,"Choi, M., Choi, H., Yang, H., Procedural characteristics of the 4th Korean technology foresight (2014) Foresight, 16 (3), pp. 198-209; Lim, K., (2001) The 2nd Technology Forecast Survey by Delphi Approach in Korea (NISTEP Research Material No 77), Tokyo: National Institute for Science and Technology Policy, pp. 105-118; MSIP, KISTEP, (2013) Technology Assessment: 3D Printing, Seoul: Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, , Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning in Korean; MSIP, KISTEP, (2013) Technology Level Evaluation: 120 National Strategic Technologies of the Third S&T Basic Plan, Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, , Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning in Korean; MSIP, KISTEP, (2013) The Third Science and Technology Basic Plan, Seoul: Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, , Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning; MST, KISTEP, (2008) The Third Technology Foresight Revision, Seoul: Ministry of Science and Technology, , Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning in Korean; NSTC, KISTEP, (2012) Technology Assessment: Big Data, Seoul: National Science & Technology Commission, , Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning in Korean; NSTC, KISTEP, (2012) The Fourth Technology Foresight, Seoul: National Science & Technology Commission, , Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning in Korean; Park, B., Son, S., Korean technology foresight for national S&T planning (2010) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 6 (1-3), pp. 166-181. , 2; Shin, T., Using delphi for a long-range technology forecasting, and assessing directions of future R&D activities: The Korean exercise (1998) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 58 (1-2), pp. 125-154",,,,,,,,,23129972,,,,"English","Foresight STI Gov.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988273440

These programmes target the development of products that will not be sold for several years; therefore, one of the risks is that the products will no longer be in demand or will have been overtaken by more advanced technologies. In several cases, the authors have seen these programmes fail because the intended targets of the programme did not apply to use the programme funds (poorly targeted program) or did not use the programme properly. An integrated programme involving foresight, competitive intelligence and business analytics assists in decreasing the probability of the risks and problems described above, resulting in better designed and more successful industrial policy. These techniques can also be used to create a dashboard for monitoring programme use so that any problems can be corrected early on. The dashboard uses advanced analytics to assess programme applications and programme inquiries to assess whether the programme is being used properly. Via an integrated intelligence process, it monitors the external environment to ensure that programme assumptions in terms of what technologies are most appropriate remain valid. The dashboard relies on information available in open sources and available to the government.","Business analytics; Competitive intelligence; Dashboard; Foresight; Monitoring; Profiling; State programmes",,,,,,"Ashton, B.W., Klavans, R.A., (1997) Keeping Abreast of Science and Technology: Technical Intelligence for Business, , Columbus, OH: Batelle Press; Bergeron, P., Government approaches to foster competitive intelligence practice in SMEs: A comparative study of eight governments (2000) Proceedings of the Annual Meeting - American Society for Information Science, 37, pp. 301-308; Bonthous, J., Understanding intelligence across cultures (1995) Competitive Intelligence Review (Summer/Fall), pp. 12-19; Calof, J., Event intelligence: Time to invite your government (2007) Competitive Intelligence Magazine, 10 (5), pp. 55-57; Calof, J., Skinner, B., What's Happening in Canada.

Through a comparative case analysis, this paper looks at what firms do to make the information usable and create value. It explores factors that cause different firms to respond differently to the same trends. It analyzes the passenger car segment of the automobile industry and the response of six major firms to fossil fuel and changing environmental regulations through an analysis of their policies and strategic activities, such as new product development. It finds foresight to be an important link between firm capabilities and environmental changes. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopts the case approach to capture the linkage between the issue and the context (Yin, 1994) and uses multiple cases to explore the variables by comparing and contrasting the cases on key aspects (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). As the paper's objective is to understand the similarities and differences between dominant firms in the sector, it chooses through theoretical sampling, six firms that have a presence in all the major regions of the world – two each from the USA, Europe and Japan – Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, Renault, Toyota and Honda. This sample represents the firms and regions traditionally strong in the passenger car industry. Findings – Thus, it is seen that the relationship that was posited in the conceptual model between the goal of the firms, the vision of the future and the nature of products and approach to technology/competence development seems to be valid. However, in addition, the paper perceives that some additional linkages that link between foresight and the goals and vision of the future seem to be influenced by the extent of uncertainty. In addition, the decisions regarding portfolio of products and approaches to technology and competence development seem to be also influenced by the perception of existing competencies and the external competitive context. Research limitations/implications – This paper was based on multiple cases created out of secondary information, hence the constructs used are those which are perceived and stated. Practical implications – The paper could help firms understand decisions related to technology choices in field involving high levels of uncertainty and competition. Social implications – This paper could improve learning processes from foresight exercises, and enable strategic decisions to be taken on these. Originality/value – Thus, this paper has explored the linkages between what firms perceive and state, and what is reflected in their actions. It has looked at this linkage from the perspective of foresight, and the strategic perspective of the firm. It has come up with additional issues and questions that influence this relationship. These can inform future research in this domain. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Automotive industry; Forecasting; Strategic planning; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value creation in innovation ecosystems: how the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, 31 (3), pp. 306-333; Anonymous, A., Renault’s woes, carmakers (2011) The Economist, 399 (8736), p. 78. , p; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Barker, D., Smith, D.J.H., Technology foresight using roadmaps (1995) Long Range Planning, 28 (2), pp. 21-28; Battistella, C., The organization of corporate foresight: a multiple case study in the telecommunications industry (2014) Technology Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-69; Bennet, J., (2014) General Motors to debut next-generation Chevrolet Volt in January; GM to Unveil 2016 plug-in hybrid at Detroit Auto Show, , 7August; Bohnsack, R., Pinkse, J., Kolk, A., Business model for sustainable technologies, exploring business model evolution in the case of electric vehicles (2014) Research Policy, 43 (2), pp. 284-300; Bright, J.R., Evaluating signals of technological change (1970) Harvard Business Review, 48 (1), pp. 62-70; Brown, J.S., Minding and mining the periphery (2004) Long Range Planning, 37 (2), pp. 143-151; Cohen, B., Winn, M.I., Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship (2007) Journal of Business Venturing, 22 (1), pp. 29-49; Costano, L.A., Strategic foresight in a high speed environment (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 219-235; Daim, T., Harell, G., Hogaboam, L., Forecasting renewable energy production in the US (2012) Foresight, 14 (3), pp. 225-241; D’Aveni, R.A., (1994) Hypercompetition: Managing the Dynamics of Strategic Maneuvering, , Free PressNew YorkNY:; Dutton, J.E., Duncan, R.B., The influence of the strategic planning process on strategic change (1987) Strategic Management Journal, 8 (2), pp. 103-116; Eisenhardt, K.M., Graebner, M.E., Theory building from cases: opportunities and challenges (2007) Academy of Management Journal, 50 (1), pp. 25-32; Ford, F., (2012) Annual Report 2012, , Ford MotorsDearbornMichigan:; Ford, F., (2013) Annual Report, 2013, , Ford MotorsDearbornMichigan:; Galbraith, C.S., Merrill, G.B., The politics of forecasting: managing the truth (1996) California Management Review, 38 (2), pp. 29-43; General Motors, G.M., (2012) Annual Report, 2012, , General MotorsDearbornMichigan:; General Motors, G.M., (2013) Annual Report, 2013, , General MotorsDearbornMichigan:; General Motors, G.M., (2013) Sustainability Report, 2013, , General MotorsDearbornMichigan:; General Motors, G.M., (2014) Annual Report, 2014, , General MotorsDearbornMichigan:; Hambrick, D.C., Environmental scanning and organizational strategy (1982) Strategic Management Journal, 3 (2), pp. 159-174; Hoffman, A.J., Ocasio, W., Not all events are attended equally: toward a middle-range theory of industry attention to external events (2001) Organization Science, 12 (4), pp. 414-434; Honda, H., (2012) Striving to be a Company Society Wants to Exist, CSR Report 2012, , Honda MotorsTokyo:; Hubers, C., Lyons, G., Assessing future travel demand: a need to account for non transport technologies?

We examine data from a top management team’s activity in which they collectively display a hyperopic approach. A single in-depth field study is analysed retroductively to examine the plausibility of potential causal mechanisms that might explain the emergence of hyperopia. In the case examined, hyperopia appears to emerge from a strategic learning approach that emphasises foresightful learning mechanisms while neglecting experiential learning from direct exposure to operations. To avoid the emergence of pathologies of managerial approaches, such as hyperopia or myopia, practitioners are encouraged to engage with balanced strategic learning mechanisms of varying temporal, spatial and cognitive scope. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Foresight; hyperopia; multi-method; myopia; retroduction; strategic learning; strategy",,,,,,"Ackroyd, S., Fleetwood, S., Realism in contemporary organisation and management studies (2000) Realist Perspectives on Management and Organisations, pp. 3-25. , Ackroyd S., Fleetwood S., (eds), London: Routledge,,.

It introduces original data illustrating the declining mortality rate from CVD, and the diminishing contribution of these diseases to overall mortality rate - globally and, to a larger extent, in developed countries. The paper also analyses the reasons for continuing CVD epidemic in Russia. Based on factual evidence, it argues that those include insufficient expenditures on treating CVD patients, and critically inadequate funding of prevention programmes. Unsatisfactory use of these funds to subsidise Russian regions (without taking into account their actual needs determined by the CVD mortality rate) only makes the problem worse. Through modelling, «average» efficiency of the Russian health care system in reducing CVD mortality was revealed. The paper describes various scenarios for future development of the Russian CVD situation. In the context of innovation-based scenario, the advantages of technological foresight are analysed; specifically, the authors summarise major S&T development trends in the health sector (using data of the Russian S&T Foresight 2030), which could significantly contribute to stopping the CVD epidemic in Russia.","Cardiovascular diseases; Funding; Government; Priorities; Technological foresight","Cardiovascular Diseases; cost; economics; forecasting; health care organization; health care planning; human; needs assessment; organization and management; preventive health service; public health; Russian Federation; statistics and numerical data; survival; trends; Cardiovascular Diseases; Costs and Cost Analysis; Forecasting; Health Care Rationing; Health Priorities; Humans; National Health Programs; Needs Assessment; Preventive Health Services; Russia; Survival Analysis",,,,,"http://gov.garant.ru/SESSION/PILOT/main.htm, 6.03.015; Salazar, A., Miles, I., The impact assessment of telematics applications in health care in Europe (2004) Int.

However, few of these have examined these questions at the ""micro"" level. Yet many regions, particularly in France, are already feeling the impact of change (droughts, repeated torrential downpours etc.) and should concern themselves more with the mid-long term consequences of these alterations to the climate. The Adour-Garonne Water Agency, which has charge of water management in the greater South West area, has acted on this issue and carried out a foresight exercise between 2010 and 2013 with a view to adapting the management of water resources to the developments expected between now and 2050. This article reviews this exercise, entitled ""Garonne 2050"". Determinedly participatory, the study gives a good indication of the extent of future challenges in this agricultural - and, at the same time, attractiveregion recurrently prone to summer droughts. After reminding us of the exploratory scenarios and quantifications underlying the exercise, the authors present the three strategic scenarios selected, oriented around two key determinants: the shortage of water linked to climate change and water withdrawals for agricultural purposes. They then show what compromise solution they settled on and why, stressing the political courage required for a foresight exercise, whose timehorizon (2050) and conclusions have the potential to seriously trouble the actors and populations concerned.",,,,,,,"Chisne, P., Lagardelle, G., Pauthier, M., Gaillard, B., Hydrometrie et optimisation de l'efficience des réserves contribuant au soutien des étiages en adour garonne (2014) La Houille Blanche.

For a sustainable and stable knowledge-based economy and society it is indispensable to maintain the value-added chain also for enabling technologies inside an area such as Europe or a specific country. The maintenance of prosperity in Europe requires an innovative and stimulating environment. Creating awareness and support from a wide variety of agencies and institutions with regard to he system for enabling technologies (knowledge creation and production) is a challenge. However foresight methodologies provide approaches which can take into account a broad variety of aspects and experts for dealing with such a challenge. Therefore the Austrian Society for Metallurgy and Materials, the Montanuniversität Leoben, and the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology designed and accomplished a foresight project for developing scenarios for the manufacturing bases in Austria regarding structural materials such as steel, non-ferrous metals, polymers, and ceramic each regarded together with their composites for high-tech technologies along the whole value-chain. The emphasis of this contribution is put on the adaptation of the methodology to this specific problem. Foresight is a systematic view of the longer-term future of science, technology, business and society to identify areas for strategic research and technology with the greatest economic and social benefits. The process was organized into three stages. At the first stage the frame was defined in details. Essential elements of the first stage were the following. The advisory board with high representatives from universities, industries, and policy makers was defined and organised. The definition of the experts to be invited for workshops and the adaptation of the scenario method was worked out and discussed with the advisory board. At stage two scenarios in each of the four structural material areas (steel, non-ferrous metal, polymers, ceramic) were developed in several workshops with a strict structured procedure. At stage three a ""future conference"" discussed the developed scenarios and worked out the topics and actions across all scenarios and lead to three central issues, which were to be pursued in a follow up process. The consortium was optimally composed because of the complementary expertise. The developed procedure managed to involve and reach most of the important people for further support of the thematic outcome.

Design/methodology/approach – Service perspective is examined in the context of socio-technical transition and linked to the bottom-up and top-down social processes that foster sustainability. The foresight method applied is trend analysis. Findings – Two groups of trends were identified: the trends driven by technological development and the trends focussing on societal, managerial and consumer issues. The former consists of renewable energy sources, hybrid solutions, smart grids and smart energy markets. The latter involves distributed energy production, demand response, optimisation of sustainability and the role of energy as an opportunity and as service. The study reveals that energy is increasingly understood as a comprehensive and tailor-made service solution for communities and individual households. Consumers will enter the energy market as active participants; it raises the need for many types of services. Research limitations/implications – Deepening of understanding is required in several topics of this study, and more formal methods of foresight are needed to test the generalisability of its qualitative results. Practical implications – More effective policy measures are needed for fostering new services and social and system innovations in the area of sustainable energy. Innovation management practices should be developed in these areas. Originality/value – The paper aims to narrow the research gap linked to foresight in services by examining services in the area of sustainable energy systems – one of the “grand challenges” today. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Empowerment; Future energy services; Service innovations; Social innovations; Socio-technical transition; Sustainable energy; Trend analysis",,,,,,"Bouteligier, S., Exploring the agency of global environmental consultancy firms in earth system governance (2011) International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics, 11 (1), pp. 43-61; Brax, S., Jonsson, K., Developing integrated solution offerings for remote diagnostics: A comparative case study of two manufacturers (2009) International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 29 (5), pp. 539-560; Bryman, A., Bell, E., (2011) Business Research Methods, , 3rd ed., Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Carlborg, P., Kindström, D., Kowalkowski, C., The evolution of service innovation research: A critical review and synthesis (2013) The Service Industries Journal, 34 (5), pp. 373-398; Coates, J., An overview of futures methods (1996) The Knowledge Base of Futures Studies, , Slaughter, R.

Discrete-event simulation is the most versatile of all modeling methods, but it lacks the simplicity in use of other modeling techniques and so has not been widely adopted in construction. The Critical Path Method (CPM) is the most popular project modeling method in construction since it is simple to use. However, it is limited to time-dependent constraints and does not handle work repetition very efficiently. Many other modeling techniques have been developed over the years but have a limited scope of application, being aimed at specialized types of project. Linear scheduling is one such example, being limited to work that progresses along a line, but is otherwise very easy to use and provides powerful visual insight into the interactions between crews and the performance of a project. Foresight is a new graphical constraint-based method of modeling construction processes, designed to offer the simplicity in use of CPM, the visual insight of linear scheduling, and the versatility of simulation. This paper compares Foresight with discrete-event construction simulation in terms of the simplicity of the resultant models for manufactured and on-site based produced components. A qualitative comparison of the two approaches is also included highlighting the superior visual insight provided by Foresight, a feature that facilitates verifying a model and determining an optimal project plan. © 2015 ASCE.",,"Construction; Scheduling; Turnaround time; Construction process; Construction projects; Construction simulation; Critical path method; Discrete-event construction simulations; Graphical constraints; Scope of application; Time-dependent constraints; Discrete event simulation",,,,,"Ceric, V., Hierarchical abilities of diagrammatic representations of discrete-event simulation models (1994) Proceedings of the 1994 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 589-594. , Editors: J.

Green energy technologies can contribute to solutions of global problems such as climate change, growth of energy consumption, depletion of natural resources, negative environmental impacts, and energy security. In this article the prospective directions of technology development in green energy are studied and analyzed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative research involves participation of key experts in the field of green energy, while quantitative analysis includes collecting and processing data from different information sources (scientific publications, patents, news, foresight projects, conferences, projects of international organizations, dissertations, and presentations) with a help of Vantage Point software. In addition, key challenges for green energy as well as its relationships with other technological and non-technological areas are identified and briefly described on the basis of expert and analytical results.

In this course, students having various backgrounds in arts and engineering schools participates and forms several interdisciplinary teams for project-based learning. The systematic methods such as Design Thinking Process and Strategic Foresight and Innovation have been combinatorially adopted for this course. Those methods are human-centered approaches, which allow deep understanding on users' needs and wants by being empathized with users and their environments. This empathy activity can enable the students to actively consider users' various aspects, which has been of much significance in the current interdisciplinary design education. It is also shown that the collaboration among the team members with the backgrounds of arts and engineering can be effective to generate more creative and innovative ideas by combining their holistic and analytic views. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Engineering schools; Graduate course; Innovative ideas; Inter-disciplinary designs; Interdisciplinary teams; Project based learning; Strategic foresight; Systematic method; Design",,,,,"National Science Foundation, (2004) ED2030: Strategic Plan for Engineering Design, Final Report NSF Workshop on Engineering Design in Year 2030, , National Science Foundation; Payne, G., Morris, L., (2007) High-level Skills for Higher Value, , Creative & Cultural Skills 2007, Design Council; Design London, (2008), http://www.designlondon.net; Innovation Design Engineering, (2015), http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/courses/design-engineering/innovation-designengineering; Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, (2015), http://www.io.tudelft.nl; Stanford Institute of Design, (2015), http://http://dschool.stanford.edu; Design Science @ the University of Michigan, (2015), http://http://isd.engin.umich.edu/degree-programs/design-science/index.htm; Treffinger, D.J., (1980) Encouraging Creative Learning for the Gifted and Talented, , Ventura County Schools/LTI, Ventura, CA; Kim, Y.S., Lee, S.W., Park, J.A., Jeong, J.Y., Exercises for cognitive elements of design creativity (2009) Proc.

Based on the assumption that new technologies may support more sustainable business, the challenge of really integrating sustainability thinking into business processes is crucial. This paper aims at discussing the importance of sustainable growth thinking in business and strategic foresight as a backdrop to purpose a flexible toolkit for supporting strategic technology management in companies, based on Voros' conceptual model. The toolkit comprises operational modules that can be combined to address a range of R, D&I management challenges. Due to its flexibility and internal consistency, the authors argue that the dissemination of the proposed toolkit can contribute to significant organizational changes related to current corporate practices of strategic technology management.

The article addresses the questions to what extent initiatives such as the foresight programmes, strategic research and development programmes, and sectoral research programmes facilitate the entrepreneurial discovery process for smart specialisation. The role of different groups of actors varies substantially in terms of their involvement and impact on such initiatives. The foresight and strategic research and development programmes were dominated by representatives of the research community and embody a research-oriented top-down approach. The sectoral research programmes are most closely related to the bottom-up and demand-driven approach in which the leading role is played by entrepreneurs. For this reason, they are more familiar with the conditions of the entrepreneurial discovery process. In this case, the important role is also played by the governmental agency which facilitates those processes. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012.","Entrepreneurial discovery process; Priority setting; Research and development; Smart specialisation strategy; Stakeholder involvement",,,,,,"Arancegui, M.N., Querejeta, M.J.A., Montero, E.M., (2011) Smart specialisation strategies; the case of the Basque country, , http://i3s.ec.europa.eu/commitment/30/download/5256.html;i3sid=2x3lTTzVBkpSqzhfJ4v1SLwW1kZJJsh2fJBpynkMGxYQ1FYrnhTG!93932101, Orkestra Working Paper Series in Territorial Competitiveness.

The objective of the developed model is to maximize the leader's market share while predicting the follower's response. In the classical competitive facility location model, it is assumed that the facility competes for all customers no matter how far they are. Although widely applied the model is, the flaws are obvious. This paper considers the service distance constraint and propose a new customer behavior, which is more accurate than the existing models. For solving the model, a two-stage hybrid tabu search algorithm is proposed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a set of randomly generated instances are presented and analyzed statistically. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides an effective means to solve the problems and the service distance is proved to be a significant factor in the model.","Bilevel nonlinear integer programming; Competitive facility location problem; Gravity-based model; Service distance; Tabu search","Competition; Facilities; Integer programming; Location; Problem solving; Tabu search; Competitive facility location; Competitive facility location models; Customer behavior; Distance constraints; Gravity-based models; Hybrid tabu search; Non-linear integer programming; Service distance; Location based services",,,,,"Plastria, F., Static competitive facility location: An overview of optimisation approaches (2001) European Journal of Operational Research, 129 (3), pp. 461-470; Ashtiani, M.G., Makui, A., Ramezanian, R., A robust model for a leader-follower competitive facility location problem in a discrete space (2013) Applied Mathematical Modelling, pp. 62-71; Beresnev, V., Branch-and-bound algorithm for a competitive facility location problem (2013) Computers and Operations Research, 40 (8), pp. 2062-2070; Hakimi, S.L., On locating new facilities in a competitive environment (1983) European Journal of Operational Research, 12 (1), pp. 29-35; Eiselt, H.A., Laporte, G., Sequential location problems (1997) European Journal of Operational Research, 96 (2), pp. 217-231; Kress, D., Pesch, E., Sequential competitive location on networks (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 217 (3), pp. 483-499; Shiode, S., Drezner, Z., A competitive facility location problem on a tree network with stochastic weights (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 149 (1), pp. 47-52; Ahn, H.K., Cheng, S.W., Cheong, O., Golin, M., Van Oostrum, R., Competitive facility location: The Voronoi game (2004) Theoretical Computer Science, 310 (1), pp. 457-467; Plastria, F., Vanhaverbeke, L., Discrete models for competitive location with foresight (2008) Computers and Operations Research, 35 (3), pp. 683-700; Alekseeva, E., Kochetova, N., Kochetov, Y., Plyasunov, A., (2010) Heuristic and Exact Methods for the Discrete (r∥ P)-centroid Problem//Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 11-22. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Shiode, S., Yeh, K., Hsia, H., Optimal location policy for three competitive facilities (2012) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 62 (3), pp. 703-707; Glover, F., Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelligence (1986) Computers and Operations Research, 13 (5), pp. 533-549","Qi, M.-Y.; Division of Logistics and Transportation, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua UniversityChina; email: qimy@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn","Kacem I.","","Universite de Lorraine","45th International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering, CIE 2015","28 October 2015 through 30 October 2015",,118692,,,,,"English","Proc. - CIE: Int.

To develop the study, a questionnaire with 196 variables classified into 5 areas was elaborated: Technological innovations, commodities for biodegradable polymers production, commodities for biodegradable packaging production, additives and technologies, the questionnaire was sent to 92 national and international people with knowledge on the topic. The expert panel was made up of 30 people who gave response to the questionnaire for three rounds. According to statistical analysis raised, in the first round, 51 priority variables and 140 variables under discussion were obtained, the 5 variables remaining were classified as non-priority. In the third round, a total of 78 prioritized variables were obtained. The results obtained in the area of technological innovations, natural coatings, active packaging and smart packaging, were considered priorities during the three rounds. In the area of commodities for the production of biodegradable polymers, the potato, cassava and corn starch were considered a priority, in addition to Agroindustrial wastes and in the technology area, reactive extrusion, blow molding and extrusion injection molding were kept for three rounds as priority variables.","Biodegradable packaging; Consensus percentage; Delphi methodology; Foresight",,,,,,"Balaraman, S., Venkatakrishnan, K., Identifying Engineering Education goals and priorities for the future: an experiment with the Delphi technique (1980) Higher Education.

Depending on the respective setting and research domain, developing or selecting an appropriate selection procedure is a complex and challenging task. This paper proposes a procedure for selecting a set of options out of a large amount of alternatives. The procedure is used within a Design Science Context. It has been developed, applied and evaluated in the course of a current research project addressing the highly dynamic Front End of Innovation. This represents a classic “wicked” and challenging Design Science problem. The selection procedure proposed in this paper can serve as a reference framework for other Design Science based projects in similar “wicked” application domains, where a theory- and practice-based definition of selection criteria and a structured evaluation process requires comprehensive domain knowledge and deep practical insights. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Corporate Foresight; Design Science Research; Focus Group Study; Front End of Innovation; Selection procedure","Artificial intelligence; Computers; Corporate Foresight; Design-science researches; Focus group studies; Front-end of innovations; Selection procedures; Design",,,,,"Lai, V.S., Trueblood, R.P., Wong, B.K., Software selection: A case study of the application of the analytical hierarchical process to the selection of a multimedia authoring system (1999) Information &Amp; Management, 36, pp. 221-232; Maiden, N.A., Ncube, C., Acquiring COTS software selection requirements (1998) IEEE Softw, 15, pp. 46-56; Nelson, B.L., Goldsman, D., Comparisons with a Standard in Simulation Experiments (2001) Management Science, 47, pp. 449-463; Jack, C.E., A revisit of two-stage selection procedures (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 210, pp. 281-286; Chen, Y., Okudan, G.E., Riley, D.R., Sustainable performance criteria for construction method selection in concrete buildings (2010) Automation in Construction, 19, pp. 235-244; Pal, O., Gupta, A.K., Garg, R.K., Supplier Selection Criteria and Methods in Supply Chains: A Review.

Although originally viewed as different cognitive skills, they are now both viewed as components of the episodic memory system. Recently, it has been suggested that the episodic system may allow us to not only pre-experience and predict our own future but also that of another person. In the current study, we investigate this possibility by examining the ability of three- and four-year-old children to plan for their own future and for that of another person. We found that both three- and four-year-old children performed equally, when planning for their own future or when planning for the experimenter's future. These data are consistent with the finding that planning for someone else's future recruits the same neural structures that are used when planning for one's own future. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Episodic foresight; Episodic memory; Mental time travel; Planning","episodic memory; female; forecasting; human; male; preschool child; recall; self concept; time; Child, Preschool; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Male; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Self Concept; Time Factors",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., Preschoolers' current desires warp their choices for the future (2006) Psychological Science, 17, pp. 583-587; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., How developmental science contributes to theories of future thinking (2007) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 30, pp. 314-315; Atance, C.M., Sommerville, J.A., Assessing the role of memory in preschoolers' performance on episodic foresight tasks (2014) Memory, 22 (1), pp. 118-128; Bauer, P.J., Kroupina, M.G., Schwade, J.A., Dropik, P.L., Wewerka, S.S., If memory serves, will language?

It manifests itself particularly in the diversity of the undertaken research topics, in the variety of the adopted research approaches (theoretical, methodological, normative, empirical-descriptive), and in the flexibility and the ability to see both the scientific problems as well as the economic and social needs. The ability to cross the boundaries between the fields of technical and social sciences, to identify problems and to seek solutions at the frontiers of scientific disciplines, the eagerness to work in research teams diverse in terms of competence, age and skills, creating conditions for both the personal development and that of individual team members, breaking the stereotypical ways of thinking in the process of solving problems and anticipating future events are all features of an academic culture nurtured by Professor Joanicjusz Nazarko.

Atherton is concerned with a single but very important facet of the behavior of labor unions-the ways in which their bargaining objectives are determined. He begins by reviewing the existing literature and briefly sketches the conceptual structure of the union. The analysis starts with a theory whose form and substance are close to existing theories, and then is altered by adding unfamiliar elements. An eclectic ""economic"" model is built with two provisional assumptions: complete internal homogeneity of preferences about bargaining objectives, and perfect knowledge and foresight of everything relevant to the attainment of these objectives. The main innovation at this stage is the inclusion of anticipated strike length as a variable which affects union preferences of goals to be pursued. In Chapter IV the first provisional assumption is dropped and the model becomes ""politico-economic."" Allowance is made for diversity of goals within the union and for the leaderships' concern to stay in office. The theory is then restated in axiomatic terms, enabling the author to dispense with the second assumption, that of the union's perfect knowledge and foresight. The theory is now adapted to deal with a union faced with probabilities rather than certainties, and additional adaptations deal with the effect of internal threats to the leaders' control of the organization. © 1973 by Princeton University Press.

Unlike operators in conventional public transit, ridesharing operators maintain flexible routes and schedules that are used in providing door-to-door service. These routes and schedules are typically created by using the assumption of perfect foresight about future travel times. In practice, however, vehicles may encounter traffic congestion, be delayed because of road work or an accident, or even break down. Thus, the routes and schedules may adhere to quality-of-service constraints in planning when perfect conditions are assumed, but operationally they often violate such constraints. This paper investigates the effectiveness of routes and schedules created under a deterministic travel time assumption. The paper evaluates practical solutions that force the schedules to include excess slack. Finally, the paper proposes and assesses a recourse option for use in actual operations of assigning to taxis those passengers who are likely to be picked up late. The evaluation was completed on a real-world case study in Richmond, Virginia. Copyright © 2015 National Academy of Sciences.

This paper reframes the evolution of attitudes towards the future in our recent history through technological positivism, acknowledgment of a complex and unknowable future, emphasis on marketing reactivity in place of anticipation, and increased development of dystopic visions of threatening unsustainable future. It will review the current situation where the future is omnipresent in media stressing its poor, uniformed, technologydriven form lacking creative imagining, accessible and attractive envisioning and rich public deliberation. The authors then build on a series of recent sustainable visioning activities (i.e. public cultural exhibition, digital interactive media, foresight visualisations for public authorities, projection exercises involving youths in schools and universities, etc.) to show how emerging practices involving designers skills to generate participative visioning processes resulting in concrete forms of anticipation accessible to all and likely to enable both formal deliberative processes and informal social conversations on the future, as well as empowerment of citizens in education for responsible living and democracy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Envisioning; Foresight; Scenarios; Sustainability; Visualization",,,,,,"Cazes, B., (1986) Histoire Des Futurs, Les Figures De l’avenir De Saint Augustin Au Xxie Siecle, , Seghers, Paris; Cuhls, K., (2003) From Forecasting to Foresight Processes, pp. 93-111. , Journal of Forecasting; Kicker, D., (2009) Wendell Bell and Oliver W.

In this paper we summarize a brief history of nanoscience and nanotechnology by documenting the main milestones on the roadmap of this branch since the beginning of the twentieth century. We discuss the new properties of materials and structures appearing in the nanoworld that originate from both classical and quantum phenomena. We provide a critical analysis of inflated versus realistic expectations of the new technology. Attention is also paid to risks and regulations in the field, as well as codes of conduct of responsible nanoscientists and specific aspects of nanoethics that open a new chapter in ethical studies. The study elaborates on five foresight topics covering the building of structures atom-by-atom, the possibilities to close the appearing nano-divide, the future of silicon, single-particle devices, and sustainability in the field and single-particle devices. Among single particle devices the focus is on the transistors and sensors. We also highlight the role of social sciences and humanities in nanoscience and nanotechnology in the fields such as philosophy, psychology, security, the protection of privacy and intellectual property rights.

However, European Americans had higher levels of intrinsic motivation than Asian Americans when they made choices for themselves. We attempted to explain this effect by examining cultural differences in social perceptions of the choice situation in two studies. Study 1 found that feelings of closeness with parents and beliefs about who has better long-term foresight mediated the predicted group differences in intrinsic motivation in a parent-choice condition when comparing Indian and Chinese undergraduates with European American undergraduates. However, perceptions of how acceptable it is for the decision maker to make the choice mediated group differences in intrinsic motivation in a personal-choice condition. Although there were some exceptions, Study 2 generally replicated these findings in a comparison of Indian and European American undergraduates, and showed that cultural differences in beliefs about how accurately the decision maker knows and takes into account the participants’ immediate preferences played an additional mediating role in the personal-choice condition, as did personal foresight. These studies suggest that cultural differences in how children construe decision making affect the relationship of such decision making to resultant intrinsic motivation. © The Author(s) 2015.","Cross-cultural psychology; Family/child rearing; Interpersonal relationships",,,,,,"Bao, X., Lam, S., Who makes the choice?

Their main purpose is to control, regulate and monitor a system to secure efficiency, reliability and specificity for a certain application under realtime requirements. Their importance manifests in a considerably increasing number of fields of technological applications, e.g. automotive, aviation and railway engineering, telecommunications as well as machinery and plant engineering. In this context, the identification of new technologies is an essential success factor in a highly competitive environment and therefore of high relevance for enterprises of ES. Hence, this paper analyses different types of methods, the importance of technology scouts, the process and relevant success factors related to the identification of new technologies in the field of ES. Open-ended and guided interviews are chosen as research method consisting of a sample of 48 experts from several industries originating in the European Metropolitan Area of Nuremberg, Germany. These interviews have been analysed employing a qualitative content analysis, which is a suitable method to systematically extract relevant information from text material. The results show that technology identification is of essential importance for companies of ES and beyond. Within the sample there exist 15 relevant methods for the identification of new technologies, e.g. subject related publications, exhibitions, internet, customer and supplier/producer. Roughly 73 % of the interviewed enterprises do not employ distinct technology scouts, instead technology identification is perceived as part of every employee's continuous duties. 36 companies use a formalised process which follows a predefined pattern. Regarding the factors influencing the success of identifying novelties in terms of ES, our study reveals six factors, namely networking, cost and profit optimisation, applicability, currency, corporate culture and competitive advantage. Our findings are highly relevant for the evaluation of technology identification processes which are critical for the success of Technology Scouting (TS), managing innovation, planning technologies as well as foresight and forecasting related to emerging technologies. This study concerning technology identification and TS commends itself as a starting point for further investigations towards the closely related theoretical concepts of Technology Foresight and Technology Management.

By using a case study of a multinational chemical company, the authors intend to show how global organizations use scenario planning as part of their strategic planning processes. Concentrating on scenario planning for regional strategies, the authors want to contribute to best practice of scenario methodology and ideally inspire academic research. Design/methodology/approach – Reviewing the literature of scenario planning and strategy elaboration, the authors focus on the Hax strategy process of strategy formation, as been applied in the case study’s company. They explain the scenario creation process in detail using a concrete example of India. The outcomes of the scenario creation process are then linked to the Hax strategy process’s description, to identify where scenario planning has created concrete value. Finally, the authors describe lessons learnt and list best practices for practitioners. Findings – Based on the analysis, the authors argue that scenario processes add value when embedded in established strategic planning processes. Lessons learned include among others that it is beneficial that the participants creating the scenarios are also those who join the strategy elaboration and that significant effort needs to go into systematically translating scenarios into implications for the organization. Originality/value – This designed case study is based on the experience of 17 process iterations during a period of five years with over 170 participants during which the core scenario process moderator team did not change. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Chemical industry; Corporate foresight; Emerging countries; Multinational; Scenario planning; Strategy",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., (1965) Corporate Strategy: Business Policy for Growth and Expansion, , McGraw-Hill Book, New York, NY; Bennett, N., Lemoine, G.J., What a difference a word makes: Understanding threats to performance in a VUCA world (2014) Business Horizons, 57 (3), pp. 311-317; Bowman, G., Mackay, R.B., Masrani, S., Mckiernan, P., Storytelling and the scenario process: Understanding success and failure (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80 (4), pp. 735-748; Boyd, B.K., Strategic planning and financial performance: A meta-analytic review (1991) Journal of Management Studies, 28 (4), pp. 353-374; Cairns, G., Ahmed, I., Mullett, J., Wright, G., Scenario method and stakeholder engagement: Critical reflections on a climate change scenarios case study (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80 (1), pp. 1-10; Darkow, I.-L., The involvement of middle management in strategy development-development and implementation of a foresight-based approach (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, , www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162513003089; Darkow, I.-L., von der Gracht, H.A., Scenarios for the future of the European process industry-the case of the chemical industry (2013) European Journal of Futures Research, 1 (1), pp. 1-12; Eriksson, T., Ritchey, T., Scenario development using computerised morphological analysis (2002) Winchester International OR Conference, , University of Winchester, Winchester; Gausemeier, J., Fink, A., Schlake, O., Scenario management: An approach to develop future potentials (1998) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 59 (2), pp. 111-130; Godet, M., The art of scenarios and strategic planning: Tools and pitfalls (2000) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 65 (1), pp. 3-22; Hax, A.C., Majluf, N.S., (1996) The Strategy Concept and Process: A Pragmatic Approach, , Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle, NJ; Johnson, G., Scholes, K., Whittington, R., (2008) Exploring Corporate Strategy: Text and Cases, , Pearson Education, Upper Saddle, NJ; Mackay, B., Tambeau, P., A structuration approach to scenario praxis (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80 (4), pp. 673-686; Mintzberg, H., The strategy concept I: 5 Ps for strategy (1987) California Management Review, 30 (1); O'Brien, F.A., Meadows, M., Scenario orientation and use to support strategy development (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80 (4), pp. 643-656; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage.

Great hopes are projected on technology to support solutions for many of the challenges arising from this trend, thus making our lives more independent, more efficient and safer with a higher quality of life. But, as research and innovation ventures are often closely linked to the market, their focus may lead to biased planning in research and development as well as in policy-making with severe social and economic consequences. Thus the main research question concerned desirable settings of ageing in the future from different perspectives. The participatory foresight study CIVISTI-AAL cross-linked knowledge of lay persons, experts and stakeholders to include a wide variety of perspectives and values into productive long-term planning of research and development. Results include citizens' visions for autonomous living in 2050, implicitly and explicitly containing basic needs towards technological, social and organizational development as well as recommendations for implementation. Conclusions suggest that personalized health and living environments play an important part in the lay persons' view of aging in the future, but only if technologies support social and organizational innovations and yet do not neglect the importance of social affiliation and inclusion. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.","Aging; Assessment of Health Care Needs; Assisted Living Facilities; Foresight; Patient-Centered Care; Public Participation","Aging of materials; Assisted living; Public policy; Assessment of Health Care Needs; Economic consequences; Foresight; Organizational development; Organizational innovation; Patient-centered care; Public participation; Research and development; Economic and social effects; aged; aging; assisted living facility; basic needs; cross linking; human; neglect; organizational development; vision; assisted living facility; Austria; community participation; consumer attitude; health care planning; health service; nonbiological model; organization and management; procedures; Assisted Living Facilities; Austria; Community Participation; Consumer Behavior; Health Planning; Health Services Needs and Demand; Models, Organizational",,,,,"United Nations, Department of Economic and Social, (2013), http://esa.un.org/wpp/Documentation/pdf/WPP2012_HIGHLIGHTS.pdf, AffairsPopulation Division, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision, Highlights and Advance Tables ESA/P/WP.228 last access 12.12.2014; World Health Organization & National Institute on Aging, Global Health and Aging, (2011), http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/global_health.pdf, WHO, Geneva last access 30.01.2015; Svedin, U., (2009) The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning.

Such detailed modeling is necessary wherever the existing stock plays a key role in determining policy cost. The soon-to-be-implemented Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS) regulation imposes unit-level emissions rate constraints on nearly 1100 coal-fired units, forcing retrofit or retire decisions at a large portion of the existing fleet. Covered emissions and retrofit costs depend in a detailed way on unit configuration and coal quality, forcing development of new techniques to handle the enormous expansion in model size and detail. These retrofit/retire decisions are being made under uncertainty about future carbon policies for the sector. FACETS was used to compare ""foresight"" scenarios in which the model could ""see"" both the MATS requirements and a power sector clean energy standard (CES) to ""myopic"" scenarios in which the MATS decisions made in the Reference scenario are fixed in the model solution up through the MATS compliance window in model year 2018, after which the model is free to begin responding to the CES. The overall national costs of myopia were found to be small, except when the carbon policy ramps up very quickly after air quality compliance decisions are made, but significant regional heterogeneity exists. Stranded asset costs from retrofitted units that must be underutilized or abandoned later range from $2 to 8 billion in the myopic cases. Substantially fewer retrofits are undertaken in the foresight cases, reducing stranded asset costs in some regions by up to 100 %. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Air quality; Carbon; Coal; Regulatory compliance; Retrofitting; Air quality compliance; Carbon policy; Clean energy standards; Coal fired units; Detailed modeling; Emissions rates; Model solution; TIMES modeling; Costs",,,,,"Pizer, W., Sanchirico, J.N., Batz, M., Regional patterns of u.S.

With a focus resolutely on the future and the pooling of knowledge, the La Fonda association began a foresight exercise in 2010 entitled ""Building 2020 Together"". The aim of the study was to explore the future of the voluntary sector in France, so that those in the sector could spot the major upcoming issues and take account of them in their strategies. In this article, Helene Bonvalot, who coordinated the exercise up until July 2014, explains what it consisted in and presents the lessons learned. After outlining the general features of the sector and the method employed in this foresight exercise, she shows how voluntary organizations are currently at a parting of the ways in a society affected by three major trends (towards fragmentation of institutional patterns, fluidity of social relations, and empathy) and in a world in crisis and transition. This new context offers significant opportunities for the voluntary world, since it can create opportunities for new partnership models through participation in the implementation of new regulations, promoting the links between the global and the local, or finding a place in emergent socio-economic logics (the circular or the collaborative economy) etc. It is up to the actors in the sector to grasp these opportunities and so play a part, in this (long) transitional phase, in building a future which is chosen rather than merely endured.",,,,,,,"http://www.fonda.asso.fr; Bazin, C., Malet, J., (2012) La France Associative en Mouvement, , 10e édition, Paris: Recherches et solidarités; (1964) Phénoménologie du Temps et Prospective, , Paris: Presses universitaires de France; http://www.kisskissbankbank.com/, On peut notamment citer; http://fr.ulule.com/; http://www.helloasso.fr/","Bonvalot, H.",,,"Futuribles",,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

We find that instability continues to be a robust outcome for transformations such as differencing and detrending the data, the two most typical approaches in econometrics to handle nonstationary time series data. We also find that inverting the data, a transformation that can be motivated by the agent reversing the time direction in an attempt to improve her forecasts, may lead the dynamics to a perfect-foresight path. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Ordinary least squares learning; Stability; Temporary equilibrium",,,,,,"Anderson, T.W., On asymptotic distributions of estimates of parameters of stochastic difference equations (1959) Ann.

This paper extends the examples in Bagnoli et al. to a general model of a durable-goods seller selling over a finite horizon to any finite number of individually significant consumers with different reservation prices for the product and provides a complete characterization of the equilibrium pricing strategies of the seller. ©2015 by De Gruyter.","durable goods; game theory; pricing",,,,,,"Bagnoli, M., Salant, S.W., Swierzbinski, J.E., Durable-Goods Monopoly with Discrete Demand (1989) Journal of Political Economy, 97 (6), pp. 1459-1478; Besanko, D., Winston, W.L., Optimal Price Skimming by a Monopolist Facing Rational Consumers (1990) Management Science, 36 (5), pp. 555-567; Bond, E., Samuelson, L., Durable Good Monopolies with Rational Expectations and Replacement Sales (1984) RAND Journal of Economics, 15 (3), pp. 336-345; Bulow, J.I., Durable-Goods Monopolists (1982) Journal of Political Economy, 90 (2), pp. 314-332; Butz, D.A., Durable-Good Monopoly and Best-Price Provisions (1990) American Economic Review, 80 (5), pp. 1062-1076; Coase, R.H., Durability and Monopoly (1972) Journal of Law and Economics, 15, pp. 143-149; Conlisk, J., Gerstner, E., Sobel, J., Cyclic Pricing by a Durable Goods Monopolist (1984) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 99 (3), pp. 489-505; Erat, S., Kavadias, S., Introduction of New Technologies to Competing Industrial Customers (2006) Management Science, 52 (11), pp. 1675-1688; Gul, F., Sonnenschein, H., Wilson, R., Foundations of Dynamic Monopoly and the Coase Conjecture (1986) Journal of Economic Theory, 39 (1), pp. 155-190; Kahn, C., The Durable Goods Monopolist and Consistency with Increasing Costs (1986) Econometrica, 54 (2), pp. 275-294; Levine, D.K., Pesendorfer, W., When Are Agents Negligible?

Compared to other prospective exercises, the originality of the approach lies in an interdisciplinary, participative and inductive method based on perceived features from the field. The proposed scenarios are illustrated by examples for professions and organizations related to justice.

We also show that irrespective of production technology employed by the firms, the capital stock sequence converges to the steady state stock and from some time onward all impatient households are in the maximum borrowing state, whereas the most patient household owns entire capital stock and the debts of all other households. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Convergence; Existence; Growth; Heterogeneous agent; Limited borrowing; Turnpike property",,,,,,"Becker, R.A., On the long-run steady state in a simple dynamic model of equilibrium with heterogeneous households (1980) Q.

This paper addresses recent concern that the mobilities paradigm has neglected two domains relevant to cargo: global production networks and global cultures of consumption. These domains are examined in relation to three key elements in this paper: distribution, consumption and marketing. In assessing moving consumption from the perspective of the mobilities paradigm, this paper recommends that the future of cargo, the ease of which consumers take utterly for granted, is far from clear-cut from a strategic foresight perspective. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","cargo; global consumption; mobilities; networks; supply chain",,,,,,"Amis, J., Silk, M.L., Transnational Organization and Symbolic Production: Creating and Managing a Global Brand (2010) Consumption Markets & Culture, 13 (2), pp. 159-179; van Asperen, E., (2009) Essays on Port, Container, and Bulk Chemical Logistics Optimization, , Rotterdam: Erasmus University; (1947), Series A518 Item Y840/1/1.

We show how some of the technologies highlighted may impact future space programmes, in particular novel ideas to enable future long-life large telescopes to be deployed. The study's final report was presented to ESA's High level Science Policy Advisory Committee (HISPAC) in late 2014. The goals of the study were to forecast the development of breakthrough technologies to enable novel space missions in the 2030-2050 timeframe, and to identify related partnerships through synergies with non-space specialists. It was not prepared to serve as a definitive guide for very specific technologies to be developed for future space missions, but to inform on and flag up the main developments in various technological and scientific areas outside space that may hold promise for use in the space domain. The report does this by identifying the current status of research for each domain, asserting the development horizon for each technology and providing some entry points, in the form of key European experts and institutions with knowledge of the domain. The identification of problems and solutions specific to the space area led us to focus the discussion around the concept of ""Overwhelming Drivers"" for space research and exploration, i.e. long-term goals that can be transposed into technological development goals. Two of these overwhelming drivers are directly relevant to ambitious future telescope projects, and we will show how some of the technologies we identified such as biomimetic structures, nanophotonics, novel materials and additive manufacturing could be combined to enable revolutionary new concepts for space telescopes. © 2015 SPIE.",,"Biomimetic materials; Biomimetics; Innovation; Societies and institutions; Space flight; Space research; Space telescopes; Technological forecasting; Advisory committee; Biomimetic structures; Breakthrough technology; European Space Agency; Problems and Solutions; Technological breakthroughs; Technological development; Technology foresight; Biomimetic processes",,,,,"European Science Foundation, Scientific Forward Looks, , http://www.esf.org/publications/forward-looks.html; European Science Foundation, Technological Breakthroughs for Scientific Progress (TECHBREAK), , http://www.esf.org/fileadmin/Public_documents/Publications/techbreak.pdf; Postman, M., Brown, T., Sembach, K., Giavalisco, M., Traub, W., Stapelfeldt, K., Calzetti, D., Hyde, T., Advanced Technology Large- Aperture Space Telescope: Science drivers and technology developments (2012) Optical Engineering, 51 (1), p. 011007; MacEwen, H.A., In-space infrastructures and the Modular Assembled Space Telescope (MAST) (2013) Proc.

We distinguish the classical prospective approach, based on works of French philosopher Gaston Berger and approaches combining the works of G. Altshuller with the theory of logistic growth curves.

This study transforms an otherwise standard dynamic macroeconomic model into an open-ended dynamic game by requiring consumers and firms with intertemporal utility and profit objectives to be locally constructive. Tested locally constructive decision processes for the consumers and firms range from simple reactive reinforcement learning to adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Computational experiments are used to explore macroeconomic performance under alternative decision-process combinations relative to a social planner benchmark solution. A key finding is that simpler decision processes can outperform more sophisticated decision processes such as ADP. However, memory length permitting some degree of adaptive foresight is critical for good performance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Constructive rationality; Game theory; Intertemporal optimization; Learning; Macroeconomics",,,,,,"Alden, J.M., Smith, R.L., Rolling horizon procedures in nonhomogeneous Markov decision processes (1992) Oper.

Humans have been found to exhibit systematic affective forecasting biases that involve overestimation of the intensity and duration of future feelings. Although recent research has elucidated the proximate mechanisms underlying our ability to predict future feelings, explanations concerning the potential adaptive significance of these biases have attracted little attention. Here we consider the function of affective forecasts as signals of biological value, drivers of goal pursuit, and tools for eliciting collaboration. Although affective forecasting biases can have significant costs, for instance in terms of one's pursuit of happiness, they may ultimately serve adaptive functions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive function; Affective forecast; Episodic foresight; Impact bias; Motivation; Prospection","Biology; Cognitive systems; Motivation; Adaptive functions; Biological values; Episodic foresight; Impact bias; Prospection; Recent researches; Forecasting; affective forecasting; attention; cost; endowment effect; fitness; forecasting; happiness; human; motivation; Review; anticipation; emotion; social behavior; Anticipation, Psychological; Emotions; Humans; Motivation; Social Behavior",,,,,"Killingsworth, M.A., Gilbert, D.T., A wandering mind is an unhappy mind (2010) Science, 330, p. 932; Stawarczyk, D., Phenomenology of future-oriented mind-wandering episodes (2013) Front.

Field research by scientists from DPZ started in the middle 1980s at a time when this was not yet considered a major task for DPZ. Establishment of field research became possible due to recommendations from institutional and departmental evaluations and the formation of a working group ""Ethology and Ecology"", which was later transformed into a department in the 1990s. Since then, field research has gained momentum, and has become part of the research program of other DPZ departments. The DPZ is now unique, as it runs field sites in all major areas of primate distribution. The foresight and support of Hans-Jürg Kuhn during his period as scientific director was seminal and essential for the evolution of primate field research at DPZ. © Author(s) 2015.",,,,,,,"Barelli, C., Matsudaira, K., Wolf, T., Roos, C., Heistermann, M., Hodges, J.K., Ishida, T., Reichard, U., Extra-pair paternity confirmed in wild white-handed gibbons (2013) Am.

Contextual intelligence is described as the ability to recognize patterns of interrelated artifacts inherent in events or circumstances, which result in intentional behaviors that facilitate influence. This chapter is divided into sections that introduce the concept of contextual intelligence as a framework rooted in three core concepts. Those concepts include understanding non- Newtonian thinking, synchronicity, and tacit knowledge. Following a discussion of these core concepts, the model is expanded to include three-dimensional (3D) thinking, which requires the practical application of hindsight, insight, and foresight through the lenses of the three core concepts. The chapter concludes with a diagram of the contextual intelligence circumplex and a breakdown and description of 12 meta-competencies (behaviors) associated with contextual intelligence. © 2015 by IGI Global.

The possibility that it could become a dual carriageway was considered. It was designed so it could be easily widened in order to increase its capacity. The same principle was applied to all the structures in that section of the highway. Among them, there are two singular ones: San Timoteo and Canero viaducts, a record in Spain’s push launched bridges because of the length of its spans. In 2003, Acciona Ingeniería co-designed the widening of that section of the highway, carrying out the happy foresight decided years ago. The decks of both viaducts are of the same composite steel/post-tensioned concrete type and are defined by a steel box girder of 6.00m in width.

An artificial beetle could gather and relay data and images from compromised environments on earth and other planets to decision makers. It could also be used for surveillance of foes and friends alike, and will require ethical foresight and oversight. What would it take to develop an artificial beetle? Several biotemplating techniques can be harnessed for the replication of external structural features of beetle bodies, and thus preserve functionalities such as coloration of the exoskeleton and the hydrophobicity of wings. The body cavity must host a power supply, motors to move the wings for flight, sensors to capture ambient conditions and images, and data transmitters and receivers to communicate with a remote command center. All of these devices must be very small and reliable. © 2015 SPIE.","Artificial beetle; Bioreplication; Communication; Exoskeleton; Flight control; Hydrophobicity; Imaging optics; Power supply","Communication; Decision making; Hydrophobicity; Artificial beetle; Bioreplication; Exoskeleton; Flight control; Imaging optics; Power supply; Biomimetics",,,,,"Béthoux, O., The earliest beetle identified (2009) Journal of Paleontology, 83, pp. 931-937; Grove, S.J., Stork, N.E., An inordinate fondness for beetles (2000) Invertebrate Taxonomy, 14, pp. 733-739; Hunt, T., Bergsten, J., Levkanicova, Z., Papadopoulou, A., St. John, O., Wild, R., Hammond, P.M., Vogler, A.P., A comprehensive phylogeny of beetles reveals the evolutionary origins of a superradiation (2007) Science, 318, pp. 1913-1916; Seago, A.E., Brady, P., Vigneron, J.-P., Schultz, T.D., Gold bugs and beyond: A review of iridescence and structural colour mechanisms in beetles (Coleoptera) (2009) Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 6, pp. S165-S184; Stevens, M., Merilaita, S., Defining disruptive coloration and distinguishing its functions (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 364, pp. 481-488; Bar-Cohen, Y., (2006) Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, USA; Lakhtakia, A., Martín-Palma, R.J., (2013) Engineered Biomimicry], , Elsevier Waltham, MA, USA; Lilienthal, O., (1911) Birdflight As the Basis of Aviation: A Contribution Towards A System of Aviation, , Longmans & Green London, United Kingdom; February 9, 1990: Death of George de Mestral (2004) APS News, 13 (2), p. 2; Autumn, K., Gravish, N., Gecko adhesion: Evolutionary nanotechnology (2008) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 366, pp. 1575-1590; Hawkes, E.W., Eason, E.V., Christensen, D.L., Cutkosky, M.R., Human climbing with efficiently scaled gecko-inspired dry adhesives (2015) Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 12, p. 20140675; Dutta, P.K., Dutta, J., Tripathi, V.S., Chitin and chitosan: Chemistry, properties and applications (2004) Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research, 64, pp. 20-31; Rinaudo, M., Chitin and chitosan: Properties and applications (2006) Progress in Polymer Science, 31, pp. 603-632; Dushkina, N., Lakhtakia, A., (2013) Structural Colors, , Lakhtakia, A., and Martín-Palma, R.

The extreme borrowing constraint used in the classical version of the model, surveyed in Becker (2006), and the limited form of borrowing constraint examined in Borissov and Dubey (2015) are relaxed to allow more liberal borrowing by the households. A perfect foresight equilibrium is shown to exist in this economy. We describe the steady state equilibria for the liberal borrowing regime and show that as the borrowing regime is progressively liberalized, the steady state wealth inequality increases. Unlike the case of a limited borrowing regime, an equilibrium path need not converge in the case of liberal borrowing regime. We show through an example that a two period cyclic equilibrium exists when agents are allowed to borrow against their two period future wage income. This result is similar to the possibility of non-convergent equilibrium capital stock sequences in the model with no borrowing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Existence; Gini coefficient; Growth; Heterogeneous agents; Liberal borrowing; Turnpike property",,,,,,"Alesina, A., Perotti, R., Income distribution, political instability, and investment (1996) Eur.

This perception of competitive intelligence as a strategic tool is only widely used in developed countries but it has been effectively used in developing economies as well. The research will be a survey of companies in eleven industrial sectors in Malaysia to evaluate the existence and the process of use of CI in Malaysian companies. Finding from the survey shows that CI awareness is needed in making sure that companies take the advantages of CI.","Competitive intelligence; Developing country; Strategic management","Competitive intelligence; Developing countries; Economics; Industrial research; Information management; Planning; Regional planning; Strategic planning; Surveys; Sustainable development; Competitive dynamics; Developed countries; Developing economies; Industrial sector; Market factors; Strategic management; Strategic management tools; Strategic tool; Competition",,,,,"Bellinger, G., Castro, D., Mills, A., (2004) Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom, , http://www.systems-thinking.org/dikw/dikw.htm, Retrieved May 15, 2012; Canongia, C., Synergy between competitive intelligence (CI), knowledge management (KM) and technological foresight (TF) as a strategic model of prospecting - The use of biotechnology in the development of drugs against breast cancer (2006) Biotechnology Advances, 25, pp. 57-74; Havenga, J., Botha, D., (2003) Developing Competitive Intelligence in the Knowledge-based Organization, , www.saoug.org.za/archive/2003/0312a.pdf, Retrieved December 16, 2012, from; Huggins, R., Regional competitive intelligence: Benchmarking and policy-making (2010) Regional Studies, 44 (5), pp. 639-658; Kahaner, L., (1996) Competitive Intelligence: From Black Ops to Boardrooms - How Businesses Gather, Analyse, and use Information to Succeed in the Global Marketplace, , New York, NY: Simon and Schuster; Luo, H., Determinants of knowledge sharing in university academic team (2009) The 2009 Second International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling, , Paper presented at Huazhong, China; Nasri, W., Competitive intelligence in Tunisian companies (2011) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 24 (1), pp. 53-67; Strauss, A.C., (2008) Competitive Skills Needed in South Africa, , https://ujdigispace.uj.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10210/3469/Strauss.pdf?sequence=1, Retrieved August 10, 2012, from; Woods, P.C., (2010) Considering Intelligence, , Keynote Address, KMICE2, Penang; Xu, K., Liao, S.S., Li, J., Song, Y., Mining comparative opinions from customer reviews for competitive intelligence (2011) Decision Support Systems, 50 (4), pp. 743-754; Kahaner, L., (1996) Competitive Intelligence: From Black Ops to Boardrooms - How Businesses Gather, Analyse, and use Information to Succeed in the Global Marketplace, , New York, NY: Simon and Schuster; Pellissier, R., Kruger, P., Understanding the use of strategic intelligence as a strategic management tool in the long-term insurance industry in South Africa (2011) South African Journal of Information Management, 13 (1); Hanninger, E., (2009) What is the Difference between Quantitative and Qualitative Research?, , http://voices.yahoo.com/what-difference-between-qualitative-quantitative-2994901.html?cat=4, Retrieved November 20, 2012, from",,"Soliman K.S.","","International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA","25th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Vision 2020: From Regional Development Sustainability to Global Economic Growth, IBIMA 2015","7 May 2015 through 8 May 2015",,114272,,9780986041945,,,"English","Proc.

The ""old-school"" entrance examination is now replaced by selection at the end of a first year in university, but awareness of the value of the new system has not been helped by the reluctance and fears (often unjustified) of some professional physiotherapists. This lack of foresight has undoubtedly slowed the formal establishment of the new method of selecting our students and, consequently, delayed the implementation of the reform of physiotherapy training. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Entrance examination; Initial training; Physiotherapy studies; Reform; Selective admission","Article; awareness; educational mobility; fear; human; medical education; medical school; medical student; physiotherapist; physiotherapy practice; school admission",,,,,"République française, http://www.legifrance.gouv, Arrêté du 8 juillet 1998 modifiant l'arrêté du 19 janvier 1988 modifié relatif au fonctionnement des écoles paramédicales; Syndicat national des directeurs d'école.

Although there has been some shift to incorporate perspectives and ideas about emergent strategy, these draw primarily from theory related to organizational learning. This paper presents a critique of conventional approaches to strategic management by taking an inter-disciplinary perspective of strategy drawing on organizational learning, system dynamics, complexity theory, futures thinking, creativity and decision-making. It argues instead for a shift of perspective to that of strategy making, by way of a strategic enactment process that embraces a more organic, dynamic, emergent nature of strategy. A set of practices is proposed that may facilitate strategic conversation in such a strategic enactment process. This is a systemic set of practices to facilitate effective strategy and in traversing complexity and turbulence. It overcomes the formulation and implementation dichotomy by taking a holistic perspective and integrating them into a single gestalt of thinking-action, applicable in a wide variety of organizations and contexts.","Complexity; Emergence; Foresight; Strategic enactment; Strategy",,,,,,"Anderson, P., Complexity theory and organization science (1999) Organization Science, 10 (3), pp. 216-232; Bodhanya, S., Strategic enactment: An interpretive approach to organisational strategy (2014) Problems and Perspectives in Management, 12 (2), pp. 130-138; Brown, J., Isaacs, D., (2005) The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter, , San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler; Buchanan, M., (2003) Small World: Uncovering Nature's Hidden Networks, , Phoenix, London; Burgelman, R.A., Strategy making as a social learning process: The case of internal corporate venturing (1988) Interfaces, 18 (3), pp. 74-85; Chaffee, E.E., Three models of strategy (1985) Academy of Management Review, 10 (1), pp. 89-98; Checkland, P., Scholes, J., (1999) Soft Systems Methodology in Action, , Wiley, Chichester; De Bono, E., (1990) Lateral Thinking, , Penguin Books, London; De Bono, E., (1969) The Mechanism of Mind, , Simon and Schuster, New York; Eisenhardt, K.M., Martin, J.A., Dynamic capabilities: What are they?

The managerial judgment perspective closely integrates resource-based theories and theories of managerial cognition. It builds centrally on the construct of ""management's theory of success"" as a representation of managers' beliefs and expectations concerning the factors that lead to desired outcomes in the light of Knightean uncertainty and that is formed through learning from small samples over time. The managerial judgment perspective may be seen as a theory that explains the formation of strategies independently from their eventual performance, but may also shed light on the cognitive antecedents of superior performance. It also argues for a conception of strategic agency in terms of ecological rationality.

In this paper, we review the pioneering activities of the program’s founder, Charles Moore, and provide insights into his foresight about the potential importance of information systems to business organizations. We explain how the program’s founding marked a shift in the epistemological view of information systems education in the mid-1960s. We show the course offerings of business data processing and information systems and the timeline at MSU over the past five decades. We also share how his efforts are instilled in the continuing development of the business information systems program at Mississippi State University to this day. © 2015 by the Association for Information Systems.","Data processing; Information systems; IS career; IS curriculum; IS history; Programming","Biographies; Curricula; Data handling; Data processing; Information systems; Mathematical programming; Business information systems; Business organizations; Continuing development; Information systems educations; IS career; IS curriculum; Is history; Mississippi State University; Punch card systems",,,,,"Ackoff, R., Management misinformation systems (1967) Management Science, 14 (4), pp. 18-20; Aron, J.D., Information systems in perspective (1969) Computing Surveys, 1 (4), pp. 213-236; Bacon, J., Fitzgerald, B., A systemic framework for the field of information systems (2001) The DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems, 32 (2), pp. 46-67; Couger, J.D., Davis, G.B., Dologite, D.G., Feinstein, D.L., Gorgone, J.T., Jenkins, A.M., Kasper, G.M., Valacich, J.S., IS'95: Guideline for undergraduate IS curriculum (1995) MIS Quarterly, 19 (3), pp. 341-359; Davis, G., Olson, M., (1974) Management Information Systems: Conceptual Foundations, Structure, and Development, , New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; (1974) Starkville, 2p. , Dr. Moore to present paper in England; Drucker, P., What the computers will be telling you (1966) Nation’s Business, 54 (8), pp. 84-91; (1958) Anniston, 39p. , Electronic data processing course set at university; Gray, W., (1962) A Compiler for the Bama-Bell Floating Point Interpretive System, , (Masters thesis).

This is mainly due to increasing awareness among politicians, academics and the wider population on the importance of environmental aspects in daily life. Consequently demand for environmentally friendly solutions is expected to grow continuously in the next decade. The present study is part of a broader research project which examines the long-term science and technology (S&T) agenda in Russia up to 2030. The project's results were approved by the Prime Minister of Russia in early January 2014. Researchers from the National Research University Higher School of Economics carried out the research project at the request of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science between 2011 and 2013. The research comprised six interrelated spheres: ICT; biotechnology, medicine and public health; new materials and nanotechnologies; environmental management; transport and space systems; and energy efficiency and energy conservation. For each sphere, the project explored in-depth the global emergent challenges and opportunities, the risks, and their degree of influence on Russia. The authors analysed the most important potential market niches, products and services that are capable of radically shaping world markets and highlighted their competitive advantages. Within the framework of these priority science areas authors emphasised several spheres of particular potential value and compared the level of research carried out in Russia and the leading countries. The current paper also covers the analyses of the natural resources sector made within a project aimed at integration of national and sectoral S&T Foresight studies funded by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science. Findings show that the potential applications for environmental products and services are manifold. The study is based on a thorough analysis of expert opinions and their assessment of future applications and the development of demand for these applications. However the authors note that the expert opinions included in the assessment of prospective products, services and markets, despite being based on rigorous assessment, still reflect expectations. Their opinions incorporate a degree of uncertainty especially with regard to how and when (or whether) the markets, technologies, products and services will develop in the expected ways.

Michigan Avenue, Chicago, IL  60605, United States","Using the concept of Postnormal Times to investigate the Internet’s infectious connectivity, this study deploys a new foresight method to explore the emerging forces and issues pushing and weighing the Internet in the years to come. The Centre for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies’ Three Tomorrows method explores temporally diffuse, yet interconnected, alternative future(s) scenarios through the lens of a single phenomenon or thematic. In this instance, affect is the locus of inquiry. While affect has received greater attention in philosophical and theoretical circles, it remains an understudied concept in Futures Studies and within scenarios for the future of the Internet specifically. Wielding black swans, black elephants, and black jellyfish—a new concept for emerging issues analysis—to seed scenarios for and within the context of postnormal times, this chapter uses the Three Tomorrows method to construct and extrapolate the concept of infectious connectivity, which aims to understand the ways with which Internet-related factors and forces can and might affect our all-too-human bodies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Affect; Black jellyfish; Futures studies; Infectious connectivity; Postnormal times",,,,,,"Abbott, M., (2014) When Social Media Makes Something Go Viral in Real Life, , http://www.huffington-post.com/megan-abbott-/dont-look-now-social-medi_b_5534200.html; Admin, W.K.B.W., (2012) Social Networking to Blame for Spreading Leroy Illness?, , http://www.wkbw.com/news/Social-Networking-to-Blame-for-Spreading-LeRoy-Illness-138821059.html; Amodio, M., (2013) High-Tech Babysitters: Gadgets as Attention Grabbers for Little Ones, , http://zone.tmcnet.com/topics/articles/343806-high-tech-babysitters-gadgets-as-attention-grabbers-little.htm; Blackman, C., Brown, I., Cave, J., Forge, S., Guevara, K., Srivastava, L., Tsuchiya, M., Popper, R., (2010) Towards a Future Internet: Interrelation between Technological, Social and Economic Trends, , http://www.internetfutures.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/TAFI-Final-Report.pdf, Oxford Internet Institute, Oxford; Brzezinski, Z., (1970) Between Two Ages: America’s Role in the Technetronic Era, , The Viking Press, New York; Burns, A., McGrail, S., Australia’s potential Internet futures: Incasting alternatives using a new technology images framework (2012) Journal of Futures Studies, 16 (4), pp. 33-50; Children, adolescents, and the media (2013) Pediatrics, 132 (5), pp. 958-961; Creech, H., Andjelkovic, M., Vetter, T., Maclean, D., Rothman, D., Vergragt, P.J., (2009) Mapping the Future of the Internet onto Global Scenarios: A Preliminary View.

The concept of a classification system of automatic cataract detection based on retinal fundus images has been proposed in previous research work which consists of fundus image preprocessing, feature extraction and the building of classifier. This paper proposes to make use of the method of PCA (principal component analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of two sets of features extracted from fundus images which are wavelet features and sketch features, respectively. We find the classification accuracy rate based on new features after PCA transformation is nearly the same with the original ones, but the computation cost can really be decreased a lot. Experiment results provide a bright foresight in later practical application of classification system of automatic cataract detection. © 2015 IEEE.","cataract; classification accuracy; PCA; practical application; reduce the dimensionality","Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Grading; Image processing; cataract; Classification accuracy; Classification system; Grading and classifications; PCA (principal component analysis); Protein denaturation; reduce the dimensionality; Retinal fundus images; Principal component analysis",,,,,"Yang, M., Yang, J., Zhang, Q., Niu, Y., Li, J., Classification of retinal image for automatic cataract detection (2013) E-Health Networking, Application & Service(Healthcom), 2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on, pp. 674-679. , Oct. 9; Guo, L., Yang, J., Peng, L., Li, J., A computer-aided healthcare system for cataract classification and grading based on fundus image analysis (2015) Computer in Industry, 69, pp. 72-78. , May; Niya, C.P., Jayakumar, T.V., Analysis of different automatic detection and classification methods (2015) Advance Computing Conference(IACC), 2015 IEEE International, pp. 696-700. , Year; Zeng, Y., Classification of Cataract Fundus Images Based on Ensemble Learning Algorithm, , submitted for publication; Siddalingaswamy, P.C., Prabhu, G.K., Automated detection of anatomical structures in retinal images (2007) International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications, 3, pp. 164-168; Sekhar, S., Al-Nuaimy, W., Nandi, A.K., Automated localization of retinal optic disk using hough transform (2008) 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro, pp. 1577-1580; Goldbaum, M., Moeui, S., Taylol, A., Chatterjee, S., Boyd, J., Huntel, E., Jain, R., Automated diagnosis and image understanding with object extraction, object classification, and inferencing in retinal images (1996) International Conference on Image Processing, 3, pp. 695-698; David, J., Krishnan, R., Kumar, S., A neural network based retinal image anonent extraction (2008) Proceedings of 2008 IEEE International Symposium on IT in Medicine and Education; Li, H., A computer-aided diagnosis system of nuclear cataract (2010) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, pp. 1690-1698. , Jul.14; Breiman, L., Bagging predictor (1996) Machine Learning, 24 (2), pp. 123-140; Jolliffe, I.T., (2002) Principal Component Analysis, 2nd, Ed.","Li, J.; School of Software Engineering, Beijing University of TechnologyChina; email: lijianqiang@tsinghua.org.cn",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","17th International Conference on E-Health Networking, Application and Services, HealthCom 2015","13 October 2015 through 17 October 2015",,121261,,9781467383257,,,"English","Int.

Recent advances in the literature have developed approaches to integrate technology and market roadmaps to allow a more comprehensive understanding of technology development. Inspired by the companies' widespread implementation of integrated roadmaps, public authorities have recently begun to adopt this tool for identifying science, technology and innovation priorities nationally. Making public investment in science, technology and innovation a priority is essential as countries must often make strategic choices about where to invest due to limited public resources. Accordingly, a thorough analysis of potential fields is required which provides a reasonable ratio of cost and expected value of the investment. The paper develops an integrated approach of roadmapping and scenario planning for public authorities' priority setting in science, technology and innovation. The methodology combines foresight, roadmapping and scenario planning in particular and then tests this methodology using a case study on priority setting in Russia. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Roadmapping; Scenario planning; Technology priority setting",,,,,,"Ahlqvist, T., Valovirta, V., Loikkanen, T., Innovation policy road mapping as a systemic instrument for forward-looking policy design (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39 (2), pp. 178-190; Cheng, A., Foresight mechanism for policy coordination: Some explanations based on transaction-cost view within knowledge networks (2010) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 6 (1-2), pp. 66-78. , 3; (2006) Emerging Science and Technology Priorities in Public Research Policies in the EU, the US and Japan, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/foresight/pdf/21960.pdf, European Commission.

This architectural tradition continued with remarkable continuity throughout the San Juan Basin to the end of Pueblo III. Many of the Great Houses in Chaco, which appear to be massively enlarged front-facing unit pueblos typical of the Northern San Juan, continued this tradition. Orientations of the back walls of Great Houses to the solstice sun or standstill moon may never have been intended by the builders. Claimed inter-site alignments of Great Houses to minor or major standstill limits appear to be the results of local topography and not intended by the builders. Late Bonito phase (AD 1100-1140) Great Houses are distinguished by their planned designs, relatively short construction period, and negligible middens. Solstice sunrise or sunset horizon foresights are present at the majority of these Great Houses, which may have been designed in part to provide demonstrations of the astronomical knowledge of the Chacoan leadership. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.",,,,,,,"Brandt, J.C., Maran, S.P., Williamson, R.A., Harrington, R.S., Cochran, C., Kennedy, M., Kennedy, W.J., Chamberlain, V.D., Possible rock art records of the crab nebula supernova in the western united states (1975) Archaeoastronomy in Pre-Columbian America, pp. 45-57. , Aveni AF, University of Texas Press, Austin; Carlson, J.B., Romancing the stone, or moonshine on the sun dagger (1987) Astronomy and Ceremony in the Prehistoric Southwest, pp. 71-88. , Carlson JB, Judge WJ, Papers of the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, Albuquerque; Ellis, F.H., A thousand years of the pueblo sun-moon-star calendar (1975) Foundations of New World Cultural Astronomy: A Reader with Commentary, pp. 647-667. , Aveni AF, University Press of Colorado, Boulder; Fisher, V.B., Classic object lessons in southwestern archaeoastronomy (2010) Archaeoastron J Astron Cult, 23, pp. 27-34; Fritz, J.M., Paleopsychology today: Ideational systems and human adaptation in prehistory (1978) Social Archaeology: Beyond Subsistence and Dating, pp. 37-59. , Redman CL, Academic, New York; Fritz, J.M., Michell, G., (2001) New Light on Hampi, , Marg, Mumbai; Hayes, A.C., A survey of chaco canyon archaeology (1981) Archaeological Surveys of Chaco Canyon, pp. 1-68. , Hayes AD, Brugge DM, Judge WJ, New Mexico Publications in Archaeology 18A, Chaco Canyon studies.

We conducted a quantitative survey to identify the associations between the strategic profiles embedded into the profiling tool (Intelligence Provider, Vigilant Learner, Opportunity Captor and Opportunity Defender) and four variables with high impact on organizational knowledge: strategic scope, organizational agility, organizational cultural change process and the approach of competitors. We found that the relevance of our Strategic Intelligence tool's variables is a consistent base for testing the robustness of the model in software industry, in order to validate the profiling instrument. We consider that the originality of the Strategic Intelligence profiling tool, tailored to software industry requirements, resides mainly in the foresight capability of the firm, which is highly dependent on less acknowledgeable factors such as: anticipative versus non-anticipative signal processing; the profile specific equilibrium of recognitional versus analytical strategic decision and rising the actionability of tacit managerial knowledge through collective intelligence reliability.","Intelligence provider; Maturity model; Opportunity captor; Opportunity defender; Software industry; Strategic intelligence; Vigilant learner",,,,,,"Ajila, S.A., Sun, Z., Knowledge management: impact of knowledge delivery factors on software product development efficiency (2004) Information Reuse and Integration, 2004, pp. 320-325. , IRI 2004.

The chemical constituents within the organism can be replaced with the desired functional constituents by using the multi-level, multi-dimensional and multi-scale intrinsic bio-structure as template, through physical and chemical process. This innovative material, which endows the desired function while maintains the original bio-structure at the same time, is named morpho-genetic material. This manuscript presents the design, manufacture, characterization and mechanism of optical function morpho-genetic material, illustrates by two typical examples: metal-semiconductor functional wings enhanced infrared absorption and photothermal conversion, metal wing surface enhanced Raman scattering.

It looks in detail at neglected factors such as the nature of the selection environment, the agency of actors, and the influence of structure. On the basis of that evidence, as well as the premise that feedback, rather than foresight, drives behavior, we reach new conclusions on what drove the crisis, and open up an exciting opportunity for historical methods to inform theory. This challenges current policy in terms of the idea of ‘Too Big To Fail’ and the focus of regulation; it also helps us revisit the lessons that we should take from this crisis, taking us away from macro-economic factors and individual malfeasance towards structure. Overall, the analysis suggests that a historical, institutional, and evolutionary analysis, based in theory, can add a fresh perspective. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","agency; business models; feedback; financial crisis; industry architecture; structure","economic history; evolutionary theory; financial crisis; historical record; industrial structure; macroeconomics",,,,,"Acharya, V.V., Richardson, M., Causes of the Financial Crisis (2009) Critical Review, 21 (2-3), pp. 195-210; Acharya, V.V., Richardson, M., (2009) Restoring Financial Stability: How to Repair a Failed System, 542. , London: Wiley; Acharya, V.V., Beck, T., Evanoff, D.D., Kaufman, G.G., Portes, R., (2013) The Social Value of the Financial Sector: Too Big to Fail or Just Too Big?, , World Scientific, London:; Adam, A., Til, S., Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit, , http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/FIN-024, FRBNY working paper, December 2007. and; Admati, A.R., Hellwig, M., (2013) The Bankers' New Clothes: What's Wrong with Banking and what to Do about it, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Akerlof, G.A., Shiller, R.J., (2009) Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why it Matters for Global Capitalism, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Ariely, D., Norton, M., Building a Better America—One Wealth Quintile at a Time (2011) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 6 (1), pp. 9-12; Ashcraft, A.B., Schuermann, T., Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit, , Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Report 318, March, 2008; Bair, S.C., (2012) Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself, , New York: Free Press; Baldwin, C.Y., Where Do Transactions Come From?

Very different kinds of neighbourhoods can be created in our own cities. We can open up new housing options and lifestyles for a range of household types while reducing resource use and associated pollution. Using the example of the area of Leeds South Bank, it is argued that there is a chance to design an exemplary neighbourhood where future urban dwellers will be able and willing to live, work and meet a wide range of requirements within a relatively small area, thus reducing their environmental impact while ensuring a reasonable level of prosperity and wellbeing. But this will only be achieved if there is a willingness to use imaginative foresight, learn from elsewhere, and break down some of the barriers that stand in the way of innovation and the adoption of practical and far-sighted solutions.",,"environmental impact; innovation; neighborhood; sustainability; urban area; England; Leeds [England]; United Kingdom",,,,,"Adams, D., (2014) Compulsory Sale Orders: A Land Reform Proposal, , http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1047646/Prof_David_Adams-Land_Reform_Review_Group.pdf, Available at; Adams, D., Disberry, A., Hutchinson, N., Munjoma, T., Managing urban land: the case for Urban Partnership Zones (2001) Regional Studies, 32 (2), pp. 153-162; Adams, D., Payne, S., 'Business as usual?'-Exploring the design response of UK speculative housebuilders to the brownfield development challenge (2011) Urban Design in the Real Estate Development Process, pp. 199-218. , Tiesdell, S. and Adams, D.

The model takes into account the possibility that a center might suffer a disruption (being unavailable to serve some demand) and assumes that every site will be covered by its closest available center. The problem is of interest when the goal is to locate emergency centers while, at the same time, taking precautions against an unforeseen incident (natural disaster, labor strike, accident...) which can cause failure of a center. We consider different formulations for the problem and extensive computational tests are reported, showing the potentials and limits of each formulation in several types of instances. Finally, a preprocessing phase for fixing variables has been developed and different families of valid inequalities have been proposed to strengthen the most promising formulations, obtaining in some cases much better resolution times. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) withinthe International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

First, the main part is related to similarities between the Prophet Samuel and King Saul, which should lead readers to compare these two personalities. The text shows us that they both have a great deal in common by having a similar structural genealogy; both having been chosen by God and provided with prophetic gift. Second, at the beginning of Saul's stories (1 Sam 9:15) where Saul is repeatedly elected as king, and later rejected twice, there is an inner textual structure, whose goal is to stress the importance of God's providence and foresight, unlike the limited view of the average person. The identification of this textual structure helps readers see the position of King Saul's understanding, that because God does not view things the way men do, we can only judge God's actions retrospectively.","Double narrative; Election; King Saul; Prophet; Rejection; Structure",,,,,,"McCarter, P.K., (2008) I Samuel: A New Translation with Introduction, Notes and Commentary, p. 172. , The Anchor Bible, New Haven: Yale University Press; Birch, B.C., The development of the tradition on the anointing of saul in i sam 9:1-10:16 (1971) Journal of Biblical Literature, 90 (1), p. 57; Green, B., (2003) How Are the Mighty Fallen?: A Dialogical Study of King Saul in 1 Samuel, pp. 195-196. , London: Sheffield Academic Press; Tsumura, D.T., (2007) The First Book of Samuel, p. 263. , The New International Commentary on the Old Testament, Grand Rapids: William B.

Based on the word phren, phronesis means 'thought, 'intellectual perception, 'sense, 'prudence, 'practical wisdom, while prudentia is derived from prouidentia, meaning 'ability to look ahead, 'forecast, 'foresight and also 'Providence. Why, although their etymological roots were apparently different, did the Romans choose the word prudentia in order to translate Greek phronesis And how did such a translation alter the evolution of the philosophical concept of prudence in Latin culture It seems that Cicero offers a new analysis of prudentia by dividing the term prouidentia, from which it was formed, into two parts. The prefix pro- alludes not only to Aristotelian phronesis (a virtue especially related to the future and most important in political field), but also to Stoic pro-noia (or Pro-vidence) on a cosmological level, while the Latin verb videre ('to see) leads Ciceronian prudence, in ethics, towards a theoretical, i.e. contemplative, wisdom (sophia), inspired by Plato. © koninklijke Brill Nv, Leiden 2014.","Cicero; Greek and Latin philosophy; phronêsis; prudence; prudentia",,,,,,"Achard, G., (1989) Rhétorique À Herennius, , (Paris); Alesse, F., (1994) Panezio di Rodi e la Tradizione Stoica, , (Napoli); Aubenque, P., (2004) La Prudence Chez Aristote, , (Paris); Chantraine, P., (1968) Dictionnaire Étymologique de la Langue Grecque.

These resources are not only diffused equally around the world, but also they are common in some places which their neighbors often come into conflicts. Consequently, it is vital for those countries to manage their resource utilization. Lately, game theory was applied in conflict resolution of common resources, such as water, which is a proof of its efficacy and capability. This paper models the conflicts between Iran and its neighbors namely Qatar and Iraq between their oil and gas common resources using game theory approach. In other words, the future of these countries will be introduced and analyzed by some well-known 2 × 2 games to achieve a better perspective of their conflicts. Because of information inadequacy of the players, in addition to Nash Stability, various solution concepts are used based on the foresight, disimprovements, and knowledge of preferences. The results of mathematical models show how the countries could take a reasonable strategy to exploit their common resources. © The Author(s) 2015.","Conflict resolution; Non-cooperative game theory; Oil and gas common resources; Stability definitions",,,,,,"Aplak, H.S., Sogut, M.Z., Game theory approach in decisional process of energy management for industrial sector (2013) Energy Convers Manag, 74, pp. 70-80; (2009), http://www.asriran.com/fa/news/97062/%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%87-%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B2%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B7-%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%82%D8%A8-%D9%86%D8%B4%DB%8C%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%81%DA%A9%D9%87, Boundary lines are conditioned by Iraq for Iran: Retreat from Alpha Coronae Borealis!.

These technologies regd bocalorics, electrocalorics, magnetocalorics, elastocalorics and recently discovered spin-caloritronics (spin-Seebeck effect). Among the alternatives, the most advanced developments have been performed in the domain magnetic refrigeration. Because of the fact, that many of these technologies represent a potential for improvements in energy efficiency, compactness, sound level, as well as the reduction of the environmental impacts, it is obvious, that they will fulfil certain future mket niches as the replacement of the vapour compression principle. The aim of this ticle is to present and discuss the chacteristics of the above mentioned solid state energy conversion technologies, which could serve for further exploitation and future engineering. These regd material requirements and their availability, thermodynamics and energy efficiency, applications or mket niches, as well as the foresight of their future developments.","Air conditioning; Energy conversion; Heat pump; Refrigeration; Solid state physics","Air conditioning; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Magnetic refrigeration; Refrigeration; Solid state physics; Thermodynamics; Emerging technologies; Heat pumping; Heat pumps; Material requirements; Solid state energy conversions; Sound level; Vapour compressions; Energy efficiency",,,,,"Paul, J., Quo vadis, heat pump?

Run generation is the first phase of external-memory sorting, where the objective is to scan through the data, reorder elements using a small buffer of size M, and output runs (contiguously sorted chunks of elements) that are as long as possible. We develop algorithms for minimizing the total number of runs (or equivalently, maximizing the average run length) when the runs are allowed to be sorted or reverse sorted. We study the problem in the online setting, both with and without resource augmentation, and in the offline setting. First, we analyze alternating-up-down replacement selection (runs alternate between sorted and reverse sorted), which was studied by Knuth as far back as 1963. We show that this simple policy is asymptotically optimal. Next, we give online algorithms having smaller competitive ratios with resource augmentation. We demonstrate that performance can also be improved with a small amount of foresight. Lastly, we present algorithms tailored for “nearly sorted” inputs which are guaranteed to have sufficiently long optimal runs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computers; Asymptotically optimal; Average run lengths; Competitive ratio; External memory; On-line algorithms; On-line setting; Replacement selections; Resource augmentation; Algorithms",,,,,"Aggarwal, A., Vitter, J.S., The input/output complexity of sorting and related problems (1988) Commun.

Those studies experience today an emerging interest, also due to the large sets of data made available by the social media and big data phenomena. This paper presents a review of widely adopted approaches in these study activities, with three levels of detail scale: starting from a wide scale mapping of related disciplines, the second level focuses on the traditionally adopted methodologies and, on the level of greater detail, the paper describes methodological and software analysis tools that cope also with the semantic web and social media aspects. The paper finally proposes the architecture of an extensible and modular support platform for these study activities, able to offer and integrate a number of tools and functionality oriented to the harmonization of aspects related to semantics, document warehousing and social media aspects. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Collaborative tools; Foresight 2.0; Future Studies; ICT platforms","Semantic Web; Social networking (online); Collaborative tools; Document warehousing; Foresight 2.0; Future Studies; ICT platforms; Prediction and analysis; Science and Technology; Technological tools; Big data",,,,,"Accordino, F., The Futurium-a Foresight Platform for Evidence-Based and Participatory Policymaking (2013) Philosophy & Technology, 26 (3), pp. 321-332; Bell, W., What do we mean by futures studies?

Some, like London, attract an excess of speculative, momentum or tax-informed inward investment to finance their intensification. Provincial towns, on the other hand, which sustain extractive metropolii, can wither without capital or talent. Sensible planning and calibrated regional investment is the antidote to polarisation but confronts an apparent 'smart' or 'sustainable' conundrum. Grandiose, technical megaprojects like Songdo or Masdar cities and sprawling, disconnected estates are an anathema. We articulate a putative smart and sustainable solution ('. smart-SUR') with 'institutional', 'project' and innovative 'funding' components and explore mega-urban regeneration projects in the UK and Holland. Smart-SUR has geographical, procedural and teleological aspects. Its mechanism involves local engagement, institutional strengthening, tight project screening and innovative regenerative funding.

This paper, which has five parts, is mainly concerned with the past six years, which I spent as a PhD student and later as a colleague of Peter's until his death. The first analyses Peter's influence on my PhD research on the impacts of high-speed rail investment. The second demonstrates how Peter disseminated and engaged research findings in HSR policy-making through media coverage, wide professional and political networks, and in cooperation with local actors. Section three describes Peter's continuing commitment to addressing widening regional inequality in the case of Blackpool, initially as a chairman of the ReBlackpool Urban Regeneration Company and later as the leader of the EU SINTROPHER project. In section four, I show how, apart from his optimism, foresight, and enthusiasm in cities, his working philosophy and his view of the key elements which characterize a planner make him a role model for younger academics to look up to. In the final section I discuss his influence on my future development.",,"biography; philosophy; railway; urban region",,,,,"Adonis, A., Lessons of High Speed One (2009), The Chancellor's Lecture, University of Kent, 30 January; Banister, D., Hall, P., The second railway age.

To streamline their work in the field, IAEA inspectors would benefit from being able to position themselves and navigate inside vast and complex sites. Automated positioning of the inspector will result in more accurate and complete documentation of the measurements and data that they collect. While outdoor positioning using GPS is a mature technology, an autonomous system providing ubiquitous positioning without relying on any infrastructure is still an emerging technology. This paper presents the results of the Technology Evaluation Workshop that was conducted in 2014 by the Department of Safeguards of the IAEA to assess the readiness level of existing technologies, identify gaps, and validate the identified operational needs.

The cyclotron laboratory at MSU has been known for years as the best university nuclear physics laboratory in the United States, and perhaps in the world. But very few, even in its hometown of East Lansing, know how it achieved that status or why it prospered when laboratories at many other famous universities faded. In this book Austin, a nuclear physicist who has been at the laboratory since the beginning of its ascent, gives us a remarkable story. It begins with an exceptional individual, Henry Blosser, who founded the laboratory, built a cyclotron accelerator of uniquely high precision, and recruited a team of nuclear physicists that used it to establish the laboratory’s reputation. Its credibility led to a sequence of accelerators, each operating in a different sub?eld while continuing a tradition of forefront science, and to a laboratory culture that fostered the courage and foresight to compete for the FRIB in the face of daunting odds. © 2015 by Michigan State University.

In this way, we conducted a quantitative survey in view to identify the associations between the strategic profiles embedded into the profiling tool (Intelligence Provider, Vigilant Learner, Opportunity Captor and Opportunity Defender) and four variables with high impact on organizational knowledge: strategic scope, organizational agility, organizational cultural change process and the approach of competitors. We appreciate that the relevance of our Strategic Intelligence tool's variables previously mentioned is a consistent base for testing the robustness of the model in software industry, in order to validate the profiling instrument. We consider that the originality of the Strategic Intelligence profiling tool, tailored to software industry requirements, resides mainly on the foresight capability of the firm, which is highly dependent on less acknowledgeable factors as: anticipative versus non-anticipative signal processing; the profile specific equilibrium of recognitional versus analytical strategic decision and rising the actionability of tacit managerial knowledge through collective intelligence reliability.","Intelligence provider; Maturity model; Opportunity captor; Opportunity defender; Software industry; Strategic intelligence; Vigilant learner","Instrument testing; Signal processing; Software design; Software engineering; Software reliability; Software testing; Intelligence provider; Maturity model; Opportunity captor; Opportunity defender; Software industry; Strategic intelligence; Vigilant learner; Knowledge management",,,,,"Ajila, S.A., Sun, Z., Knowledge management: impact of knowledge delivery factors on software product development efficiency.

Over time, research on C. elegans has expanded to explore a wealth of diverse areas in modern biology including studies of the basic functions and interactions of eukaryotic cells, host-parasite interactions, and evolution. C. elegans has also become an important organism in which to study processes that go awry in human diseases. This primer introduces the organism and the many features that make it an outstanding experimental system, including its small size, rapid life cycle, transparency, and well-annotated genome. We survey the basic anatomical features, common technical approaches, and important discoveries in C. elegans research. Key to studying C. elegans has been the ability to address biological problems genetically, using both forward and reverse genetics, both at the level of the entire organism and at the level of the single, identified cell. These possibilities make C. elegans useful not only in research laboratories, but also in the classroom where it can be used to excite students who actually can see what is happening inside live cells and tissues.",,"animal; biological model; Caenorhabditis elegans; genetics; human; physiology; Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Humans; Models, Biological",,,,,,,,,,,,,,15518507,,,"26087236","English","WormBook",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995896895

To weaken this assumption, a class of games (called games with short sight) was proposed in literature, modelling the game scenarios where players have only limited foresight of the game tree due to bounded resources and limited computational ability. As a consequence, the notions of equilibria in classical game theory were refined to fit games with short sight. A crucial issue that thus arises is to determine whether a strategy profile is a solution for a game. To study this issue and address the underlying idea and theory on players’ decisions in such games, we adopt a logical way. Specifically, we develop a logic through which features of these games are demonstrated. More importantly, it enables us to characterize the solutions of these games via formulas of this logic. This work not only provides an insight into a more realistic model in game theory, but also enriches the possible applications of logic. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Dynamic logic; Extensive games; Short sight; Solution concept","Computation theory; Data privacy; Forestry; Multi agent systems; Network security; Trees (mathematics); Classical game theory; Computational ability; Dynamic logic; Extensive games; Logical characterization; Realistic model; Short sight; Solution concepts; Game theory",,,,,"van Benthem, J., Modal Logic for Open Minds (2010) Center for the Study of Language and Information Lecture Notes, , Stanford University; van Benthem, J., Pacuit, E., Roy, O., Toward a theory of play: A logical perspective on games and interaction (2011) Games, 2 (1), pp. 52-86; Blackburn, P., de Rijke, M., Venema, Y., (2001) Modal Logic, , Cambridge University Press; Bonanno, G., Magill, M., Van Gaasback, K., (2003) Branching Time Logic, Perfect Information Games and Backward Induction, , Working Papers 9813, University of California, Davis, Department of Economics; Cui, J., Luo, X., Sim, K.M., A new epistemic logic model of regret games (2013) KSEM 2013.

Key findings are as follows. Firstly, factors inducing the emergence of the window of opportunity are multi-dimensional. Secondly, the process of innovation catch-up enabled by the window of opportunity can be divided into three stages: identifying, breaking through and broadening the window of opportunity. The stage of identifying the window of opportunity requires the capabilities of perceptive market foresight and confident technology selection. The stage of breaking through the window of opportunity requires strong capabilities for decisive risk-taking actions in technology integration, complementary R&D investment, and new market development. Finally, the stage of broadening the window of opportunity requires the capabilities of close industrial network integration and rapid market expansion.

When these weaknesses involve mechanisms common to several aspects of transnational commerce, the effect of illicit behavior, and conversely of anti-crime policy, can be magnified. This study introduces a script-network method to estimate the impact of targeting illicit behavior within the context of an entire market system. Using the high-value art and antiquities market as a case study, we anticipate the effects of two anti-crime policy directives—movement control and monitoring financial transactions. In addition to advancing a new method, two original metrics are presented—one measures the complexity of sectors in a trade system (complexity) and the other anticipates the incentive to work around crime control efforts (transformity). In consideration of these system characteristics, our results suggest that maximum decoupling of illicit\legal trade is more likely with the introduction of safeguards targeting central trade functions that are associated with valuing and gifting objects. Network-oriented research could help the prevailing market reduction approach (MRA) to be more effective in reducing transnational illicit trade because network analytics are specially crafted for dealing with the statistical challenges that are inherent to studying transnational illicit market systems. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.","antiquities; art; cultural property; illicit markets; network analysis; network complexity; scripting; transnational crime",,,,,,"(2011) Transportation, , http://www.artex.vas.com/services/index.html, .

Each oligopoly can be described using its size and composition, that is, the fraction of firms that are rational. We take into account two frameworks, one in which the decisional rules are exogenously assigned and the other in which the firms may change their heuristics. We consider a switching mechanism based on a logit rule, where the switching propensity is regulated by a parameter which represents the evolutionary pressure. In the fixed fractions setting, we prove that, in general, the composition has a stabilizing effect, while increasing the oligopoly size leads to instability. However, we show that, for particular parameters settings, stability is not affected by the composition or the firms number. Similarly, in the evolutionary fractions setting, we analytically prove that when marginal costs are identical, increasing the evolutionary pressure has a destabilizing effect. Nevertheless, focusing on particular examples with different marginal costs we are able to show that evolutionary pressure may also have a stabilizing or a neutral role. © 2015 Fausto Cavalli et al.",,,,,,,"Cournot, A.A., (1838) Reserches sur les Principles Mathematiques de la Theorie des Richesses, , Hachette, Paris, France; Palander, T.F., Konkurrens och marknadsjamvikt vid duopol och oligopol (1939) Ekonomisk Tidskrift, 41, pp. 124-250; Theocharis, R.D., On the stability of the Cournot solution on the oligopoly problem (1960) The Review of Economic Studies, 27 (2), pp. 133-134; Lampart, M., Stability of the Cournot equilibrium for a Cournot oligopoly model with n competitors (2012) Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 45 (9-10), pp. 1081-1085; Matsumoto, A., Szidarovszky, F., Stability, bifurcation, and chaos in N-firmnonlinear Cournot games (2011) Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society, 2011. , Article ID 380530, 22 pages; Naimzada, A.K., Tramontana, F., Controlling chaos through local knowledge (2009) Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 42 (4), pp. 2439-2449; Bischi, G.I., Chiarella, C., Kopel, M., Szidarovszky, F., (2009) Nonlinear Oligopolies: Stability and Bifurcations, , Springer, Berlin, Germany; Agiza, H.N., Elsadany, A.A., Nonlinear dynamics in the Cournot duopoly game with heterogeneous players (2003) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 320 (1-4), pp. 512-524; Agiza, H.N., Elsadany, A.A., Chaoticdynamics innonlinear duopoly game with heterogeneous players (2004) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 149 (3), pp. 843-860; Agiza, H.N., Hegazi, A., Elsadany, A.A., Complex dynamics and synchronization of a duopoly game with bounded rationality (2002) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 58 (2), pp. 133-146; Agiza, H.N., Elabbasy, E.M., Elsadany, A.A., Complex dynamics and chaos control of heterogeneous quadropoly game (2013) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 219 (24), pp. 11110-11118; Ahmed, E., Agiza, H.N., Dynamics of a Cournot game with n-competitors (1998) Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 9 (9), pp. 1513-1517; Angelini, N., Dieci, R., Nardini, F., Bifurcation analysis of a dynamic duopoly model with heterogeneous costs and behavioural rules (2009) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 79 (10), pp. 3179-3196; Bischi, G.I., Naimzada, A., Global analysis of a dynamic duopoly game with bounded rationality (2000) Advances in Dynamic Games and Applications, pp. 361-385. , J.

The proposed model simulates the generation investment decisions taken by a particular agent (i.e. a generating company) in a market environment taking into account its competitors’ strategic investment. The investment decision of a particular company is modeled taking into account that such company has imperfect foresight on the future system development hence electricity prices. The delay in the construction of new plants is also explicitly modeled, in order to compute accurately the yearly revenues of each agent. On top of a conventional energy market, several capacity incentive mechanisms including capacity payment and capacity market are simulated, so as to assess their impact on the investment promotion for generation expansion. Results provide insight on the investment cycles as well as dynamic system behavior of long-term generation expansion planning in a competitive electricity industry. © 2015 The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","Agent-based modeling;

Companies need a conceptual structure to assess the value of their patent portfolio. This paper develops a practical and reproducible framework that can support scholars and practitioners to leverage the value of patents and to extract all possible strategic information from patent portfolio. The patent assessment process aims at comparing and contrasting the management of patents to the company's technologic and innovative strategy. The framework employs determinants of patent value that are elicited from patent databases, such as claims, citations, and market coverage, and that are expressed in terms of judgments achieved by interviewing involved managers, such as strategic relevance and economic relevance. The paper examines the main methodological issues in assessing patent portfolio value then, it describes the characteristics of the framework; subsequently, it illustrates the implementation of the proposed framework into two companies which operate in the aerospace and defense sector. The two implementations showthat the framework can be used for strategic planning and strategic technology management. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Patent analysis; Patent portfolio; Patent value; Patent value assessment; Strategic foresight; Strategic technology management","Industrial management; Patent analysis; Patent portfolio; Patent value; Strategic foresight; Strategic technologies; Value assessment; Patents and inventions; assessment method; defense industry; innovation; legal rights; strategic approach; technological development; technology policy",,,,,"Arundel, A., Patel, P., (2003) Strategic patenting.

However, it could be fairly difficult when there are narrow passages in the configuration space. Solutions to this problem can be applicable to not only mobile robots but also other domains such as computer animation and computational biology. This paper presents a novel method called Narrow Passage Watcher (NPW) to cope with narrow passage issues in changing environments. It approximately predicts the variation trend of narrow passages and analyzes their security and thus guides safe path planning. Meanwhile, a supporting hybrid boost strategy is presented to increase the sampling density inside narrow passages with different variation trend. Compared with existing work, the predictive mechanism provided by NPW gives the planner foresight so that it can find safer paths in changing environments with a higher success rate. Experiments conducted with a dual-manipulator system with 12 DOFs show that NPW can reduce the number of replanning times and total planning time remarkably as well as improving the success rate of path planning. © Liu and Wang; Licensee Bentham Open.","Manipulator planning; Narrow passage; Robot and mechanism; Safe motion planning","Animation; Bioinformatics; Manipulators; Motion planning; Robots; Changing environment; Computational biology; Computer animation; Configuration space; Dual-manipulator system; Narrow passage; Predictive mechanisms; Sampling densities; Robot programming",,,,,"Kavraki, L.E., Svestka, P., Latombe, J.-C., Overmars, M.H., Probabilistic roadmaps for fast path planning in highdimensional configuration spaces (1996) IEEE Trans.

Agriculture both contributes to and suffers from climate change. The interaction between both is of substantial complexity; the need for action is urgent and sometimes stakeholders lack scientific evidence or political will to agree on solutions. There are different lenses through which to address the interface between agriculture and climate change: mitigation, adaptation, resilience, sustainable intensification and civic response. However none of these directions of desirable action would provide the only right answer on their own. There is a need for multiple solutions and aligned action at every governance level involving all actors in the food system: farmers, food industry, consumers and regulatory institutions. Every actor needs to take certain responsibilities. We have to be innovative, responsive and practice solidarity, looking for transition pathways. Recent EU Framework projects and foresight exercises on agriculture provide policymakers with relevant insights and recommendations. This article considers four directions in which responses and shared responsibilities could be enabled to address the climate challenge in agriculture: recognise multiple modernisation pathways; support learning and innovation networks; harness local resources and solutions; and acknowledge 'quiet' sustainability. There is reflection on the policy implications at EU, Member State and more local levels. © 2015 The Author.",,,,,,,"Summary for policymakers (2014) Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

As one of the most notable official development assistance methods for developing countries, appropriate technology has been widely used for improving location situations in various industry sectors such as IT (information technology), environment and energy. Among these sectors, the energy industry is considered one of the most active fields for appropriate technology. However, only a few studies have provided the in-depth analysis of an ecosystem necessary for the sustainable growth of appropriate technology and foresight about the future directions of this technology. This study presents the definitions, antecedents, assessment of appropriate technology and recommendations for the future of appropriate energy technology in the context of many successful cases in the energy industry. The concepts of generating ‘shared social value’ and ‘local reverse innovation' are introduced, and how they play a key role in the recommendations is explained.

However, (approximately) optimal solutions to forward-looking experiential learning problems are complex, limiting their behavioral plausibility and empirical feasibility. We propose that consumers use cognitively simple heuristic strategies. We explore one viable heuristic—index strategies—and demonstrate that they are intuitive, tractable, and plausible. Index strategies are much simpler for consumers to use but provide close-to-optimal utility. They also avoid exponential growth in computational complexity, enabling researchers to study learning models in more complex situations.Well-defined index strategies depend on a structural property called indexability. We prove the indexability of a canonical forward-looking experiential learning model in which consumers learn brand quality while facing random utility shocks. Following an index strategy, consumers develop an index for each brand separately and choose the brand with the highest index. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that an index strategy achieves nearly optimal utility at substantially lower computational costs. Using IRI data for diapers, we find that an index strategy performs as well as an approximately optimal solution and better than myopic learning. We extend the analysis to incorporate risk aversion, other cognitively simple heuristics, heterogeneous foresight, and an alternative specification of brands. © 2015 INFORMS.","Cognitive simplicity; Forward-looking experiential learning; Heuristics; Index strategies; Indexability; Multi-armed bandit problems; Restless bandit problems; Structural models",,,,,,"Ackerberg, D.A., Advertising, learning, and consumer choice in experience good markets: An empirical examination (2003) Internat.

We suggest that different future thoughts require different processes of scene construction. Thirty-five participants were asked to imagine desirable and less desirable future events. Imagining desirable events increased the ease of scene construction, the frequency of life scripts, the number of internal details, and the clarity of sensorial and spatial temporal information. The initial description of general personal knowledge lasted longer in undesirable than in desirable anticipations. Finally, participants were more prone to explicitly indicate autobiographical memory as the main source of their simulations of undesirable episodes, whereas they equally related the simulations of desirable events to autobiographical events or semantic knowledge. These findings show that desirable and undesirable scenarios call for different mechanisms of scene construction. The present study emphasizes that future thinking cannot be considered as a monolithic entity. © 2014, The Experimental Psychology Society.","Episodic future thinking; Foresight; Life script; Prospection;

In the Cold War context of the 1970s social scientist István Bibó observed and explained this phenomenon and suggested a mechanism to correct it. His idea was to set up a special international court for impartial political arbitration and to solve ""territorial and state-formation conflicts"" by the principle of national self-determination. He proposed to recognize the global territorial status quo as the ""constitution of international relations"" but to ""amend it"" by fostering ethnic-linguistic separation in the special case of irreconcilable conflicts. Viewed from today Bibó's case studies of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Cyprus question have shown remarkable foresight and several of his specific suggestions have become core elements in road maps for solving them. Additionally, in contemporary political and scientific discourses on other ethnic-territorial conflicts, opinions seem to shift in line with his views as experiences of the last decades seem to corroborate the validity of his analytical framework and general policy recommendations. © 2015, East European Journal Of Society and Politics.","Ethnic conflicts; International relations; István Bibó; Nationalism; Self-determination",,,,,,"Baskin, G., (2002) The Oslo Peace Process-Lessons Learned, , http://www.mideastweb.org/log/archives/00000017.htm, Accessed: 30-01-2015; Bibó, I., (1976) The Paralysis of International Institutions and the Remedies, , A Study of Self-Determination, Concord among the Major Powers, and Political Arbitration.

This paper comprehensively took the innate characteristics of target and the target local background characteristic into consideration, which affected the algorithm performance of target extraction and recognition, then made generalizations of three classes of evaluation methods: methods based on the target characteristic, including the target shape characteristic, the gray standard deviation of target pixels, the target Local background entropy difference, etc; methods based on the target similitude, including the edge profile and structural characteristic similitude between target and phony target; methods based on the background characteristic, including texture characteristic edge ratio, etc. And on this basis, we made research on the relationship of structural features and evaluation parameters, and analyzed the foundation and properties of each method by contrast.

Despite this fact, managerial fixation on short term performance objectives, their penchant fear of the unpredictable future and their sheer inability to face the alternative futures generated in the scenario planning exercises has led to little value capture from this activity. The paper analyzes the factors that determine the willingness of decision-makers, to be actively involved in scenario planning. The authors suggest that effective incentives to promote the interest in this activity and its impact can be found, if we consider the decision-makers, as 'consumers' of certain ideas, concepts, expectations, and competencies. In particular, the paper hypothesizes and validates the assumptions that the selection of appropriate targets for scenario planning, commitment to achieving them, expectations of positive outcomes, increasing the frequency of scenario planning exercises are more likely to be expressed in the growing interest of managers and stakeholders to develop scenarios. The presented results are tested on the most common - intuitive logic approach to scenario planning. The authors expect future research to go further to empirically test the proposed hypotheses, and if possible, ascertain whether similar hypotheses could be generated in the context of other tried and tested scenario planning methodologies such as the probabilistic modified trends, competitive intelligence and cross impact analysis.","Conceptual consumption; Intuitive logics methodology; Scenario planning; Strategic foresight",,,,,,"Amer, M., Daim, T.E., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, 46, pp. 23-40; Armor, D.A., Taylor, S.E., Situated optimism: Special outcome expectancies and self-regulation (1998) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 30, pp. 309-379; Ariely, D., Norton, M.I., Conceptual consumption (2009) Annual Review of Psychology, 60, pp. 475-499; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Cesario, J., Grant, H., Higgins, E.T., Regulatory fit and persuasion: Transfer from feeling right (2004) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86, pp. 388-404; Chen, M., Bargh, J., Non-conscious behavioural confirmation processes: The self-fulflling consequences of automatic stereotype activation (1997) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43, pp. 719-726; Cunha, M., Palma, P., Costa, N., Fear of foresight: Knowledge and ignorance in organizational foresight (2006) Futures, 38 (8), pp. 942-955; Cairns, G., Sliwa, M., Wright, G., Problematizing international business futures through a critical scenario method (2009) Futures, 42 (9), pp. 971-979; Fang, X., Singh, S., Ahluwalia, R., An examination of different explanations for the mere exposure effect (2007) Journal of Consumer Research, 34 (1), pp. 97-103; Ferraro, R., Bettman, J.R., Chartrand, T.L., The power of strangers: The effect of incidental consumer brand encounters on brand choice (2009) Journal of Consumer Research, 35 (5), pp. 729-741; Fishbach, A., Dhar, R., Goals as excuses or guides: The liberating effect of perceived goal progress on choice (2005) Journal of Consumer Research, 32, pp. 370-377; Fiske, S., Taylor, S., (2008) Social Cognition: From Brains to Culture, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Fitzsimons, G., Morwitz, V., The effect of measuring intent on brand: Level purchase behaviour (1996) Journal of Consumer Research, 23, pp. 1-11; Foster, M.J., Scenario planning for small businesses (1993) Long Range Planning, 26 (1), pp. 123-129; Gollwitzer, P.M., Moskowitz, G.B., Goal effects on action and cognition (1996) Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles, pp. 361-399. , (eds.

Design/methodology/approach – Discussion paper with special reference to the report “A Review of the e-learning markets of the UK, EU and China 2014”, published by Learning Light in 2014. Findings – Learning is not changing – but the need and the opportunities for that learning are expanding. What is changing in the learning world is not learning per se but delivery technologies – and also the relative importance in the overall learning delivery mix of this growing range of learning delivery technologies. Research limitations/implications – We’re standing on the shoulders of giants but we appear to be looking at an extremely foggy landscape. And, since we do not have “20/20 foresight”, our danger is that we spend our time “training to fight the last war” rather than “training to win the next war”. Practical implications – There are a number of technological factors as well as demographic factors that learning and development professionals need to take into account when designing and developing (online) learning materials. Social implications – As technology makes the work of subject matter experts more accessible, other factors – such as money or time availability – are likely to come into play to maintain some form of established intellectual elite.

Box 5003, Ås, 1432, Norway","Forest sector models are widely used for policy and economic analyses. Basic assumptions vary considerably between models, but little attention has been paid to the impacts these differences may have on model results. Norway provides a great opportunity to fill this void as it has two forest sector models currently in use based on different modeling assumptions, but sharing the same data source. In one model, agents are assumed to be myopic in the meaning that they rely only on the current market conditions. Harvest behavior is in this model based on econometric relations and exogenous forest growth rates. The second model approach employs extensive forest data and assumes that agents have perfect information over the model time horizon. We discuss the differences between the two modeling approaches and compare quantitatively the model results of two case studies. However, both types of models are rather sensitive to changes in assumptions and data. The strengths and weaknesses of the two model approaches and their appropriateness for responding to the study questions should be considered when choosing modeling methodology. Using both models in parallel removes the uncertainty caused by the foresight assumption/optimization routine and thus provides in total more information. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","dynamic recursive models; forest economics; forest sector models; intertemporal optimization models; myopic models; partial equilibrium","Economic analysis; Optimization; Forest economics; Forest sector model; Intertemporal optimization; Partial equilibrium; Recursive models; Forestry",,,,,"Adams, D.M., Latta, G.S., Costs and regional impacts of restoration thinning programs on the national forests in eastern Oregon (2005) Can J For Res, 35, pp. 1319-1330; Adams, D.M., Latta, G.S., Timber trends on private lands in Western Oregon and Washington: a new look (2007) West J Appl For, 22, pp. 8-14; Amacher, G.S., Christine Conway, M., Sullivan, J., Gregory, S.A., Econometric analyses of nonindustrial forest landowners: is there anything left to study?

Conversely, efforts to delineate treat-to-target in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have failed in pinpointing common goals and treatment strategies, probably because of disease heterogeneity and lack of measurable biomarkers predicting disease course and ensuring a safe treatment tapering during quiescence. Given the detrimental effects of persistent disease activity and protracted corticosteroid therapy on patients' outcome in lupus, disease remission should be pursued whenever possible. Fortunately, clinical remission is currently realistic for a greater number of patients than it was in the past, yet tight monitoring is required in order for patients to benefit from disease- and corticosteroid-free intervals, while minimizing the risk of disease flares. In everyday practice, patients should be brought to the lowest level of disease activity ensuring a significant benefit over a persistently active disease, being either clinical remission or low disease activity. © The Author(s), 2015.","Corticosteroid tapering; Low disease activity; Outcome; Remission; Systemic lupus; Target","corticosteroid; corticosteroid; Article; corticosteroid therapy; disease activity score; disease exacerbation; early diagnosis; human; medication compliance; overall survival; priority journal; prognosis; remission; SLEDAI; synovitis; systemic lupus erythematosus; time to treatment; disease course; disease management; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; severity of illness index; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Disease Management; Disease Progression; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Prognosis; Remission Induction; Severity of Illness Index",,"Adrenal Cortex Hormones",,,"Doria, A., Gatto, M., Zen, M., Iaccarino, L., Punzi, L., Optimizing outcome in SLE: Treating-to-target and definition of treatment goals (2014) Autoimmun Rev, 13, pp. 770-777; Van Vollenhoven, R.F., Mosca, M., Bertsias, G., Treat-to-target in systemic lupus erythematosus: Recommendations from an international task force (2014) Ann Rheum Dis, 73, pp. 958-967; Lopez, R., Davidson, J.E., Beeby, M.D., Egger, P.J., Isenberg, D.A., Lupus disease activity and the risk of subsequent organ damage and mortality in a large lupus cohort (2012) Rheumatology, 51, pp. 491-498; Schoels, M., Knevel, R., Aletaha, D., Evidence for treating rheumatoid arthritis to target: Results of a systematic literature search (2010) Ann Rheum Dis, 69, pp. 638-643; Smolen, J.S., Aletaha, D., Bijlsma, J.W., Treating rheumatoid arthritis to target: Recommendations of an international task force (2010) Ann Rheum Dis, 69, pp. 631-637; Rydèn, L., Standl, E., Bartnik, M., Guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases: Executive summary.

Design/methodology/approach – Aspirational futures process, intuition-based visioning and “Type II” thinking that has high credibility for knowledgeable experts but low credibility to most others. Findings – Megacrisis is a Type II wild card needing anticipatory mitigation via strategies such as are suggested. While descent paths may be a suitable meme for technical professionals, ascent paths to higher levels of civilizational maturity are a better guiding image for the public. Aspirational methods whose core involves intuition-based creativity, wisdom and co-creative emergence are a vital complement to rational/ analytic futures methods, especially in times of epochal change and uncertainty when a new “regime” of guiding world views, institutional processes and innovative technologies may emerge. Research limitations/implications – Results represent a high degree of uncertainly as well as “fringe” thinking needing to be more widely considered. Practical implications – Strategic suggestions based on Type II thinking are a unique category for “leading edge” funding and application. Originality/value – The Type II perspective offered here is unique and offers a promising approach for transformative megacrisis mitigation. © Oliver Markley, 2015.","Ascension; Aspirational; Descent paths; Ecological sustainabllity; Epochal change; Forecasting; Foresight; Intuition; Intuition; Scenario planning; Transformation; Type II wild cards",,,,,,"Agor, W., (1989) Intuition in Organizations: Leading and Managing Productively, , Sage, Newbury Park, CA; Ahmed, N., (2014) The open source revolution is coming and it will conquer the 1%-ex CIA spy, , www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/jun/19/open-source-revolutionconquer-one-percent-cia-spy, (accessed 30 June 2014); Beck, D., Cohan, C., (1996) Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership and Change, , Blackwell, Hoboken, NJ; Beddoe, R., Costanza, R., Farley, J., Garza, E., Kent, J., Kubiszewski, I., Martinez, L., Woodward, J., Overcoming systemic roadblocks to sustainability: The evolutionary redesign of worldviews, institutions, and technologies (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106 (8), pp. 2483-2489; Bezold, C., Aspirational futures (2009) Journal of Futures Studies, 13 (4), pp. 81-90; Brown, L.R., (2011) World on the Edge, , Earth Policy Institute/Norton, New York, NY; Callenbach, E., (1975) Ecotopia, , Bantam, New York, NY; Cohen, Arkin, (1993) Cooperative Housing Compendium: Resources for Collaborative Living, , University of California Davis Center for Cooperatives, Davis, CA; Dallmayr, F., (1998) Alternative Visions, , Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Lanham, MD; Dallmayr, F., (2001) Achieving Our World: Toward a Global and Plural Democracy, , Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Lanham, MD; Dallmayr, F., (2002) Dialogue Among Nations: Some Exemplary Voices, , Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, Hampshire; Dallmayr, F., (2010) Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars, , The University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, KY; Diamondis, P., Kotler, S., (2012) Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think, , Free Press, New York, NY; Drexler, K.E., (2013) Radical Abundance: How a Revolution in Nanotechnology will Change Civilization, , Public Affairs, New York, NY; Earth Charter Initiative, (2000) The Earth Charter: Values and Principles for a Sustainable Future, , The Earth Charter Fund/TPC, Middlebury, VT; Ehsan, M., Wild cards applications in futures studies (2014) International Journal of Modern Management & Foresight, 1 (8), pp. 255-263; Eisler, R., (2008) The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics, , Berrett-Koehler, San Francisco, CA; Feinberg, M., Willer, R., Apocalypse soon?

The region's ability to effectively meet these challenges will require foresight, investment, and cooperation. As a contribution to this special issue, this paper presents one plausible 50-year scenario of the emergence of these challenges and the region's response to them. In it, early signs of economic, environmental, and governmental vulnerability are not adequately addressed. Investments aren't made to provide needed funding for monitoring and evaluation. The region's intellectual and environmental capital isn't leveraged, limiting the region's ability to address its economic and environmental challenges and compete with the rest of the world. The pursuit of local self-interest and short-term survival outweighs cooperation across jurisdictions and long-term planning. The vision of the future presented here is one in which the region's economy is dependent on stagnant extractive industries, its ecosystems are compromised, and its global standing is greatly reduced. In response to all of these developments, by 2063 hopelessness and violent tension is spreading throughout the region's population. © 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.","Climate change; Divergence; Fracking; Green economy; Lake levels","Economic and social effects; Economics; Hydraulic fracturing; Lakes; Divergence; Environmental capital; Environmental challenges; Extractive industry; Fracking; Green economies; Lake levels; Monitoring and evaluations; Climate change; adaptive management; economic analysis; economic planning; environmental economics; investment; state role; survival; vulnerability; Saint Lawrence Basin",,,,,"Adelaja, A., McKeown, C., Calnin, B., Hailu, Y., Assessing offshore wind potential (2012) Energ Policy, 42, pp. 191-200; Allison, I., Bindoff, N.L., Bindschadler, R.A., Cox, P.M., de Noblet, N., England, M.H., Francis, J.E., Weaver, A.J., (2009) The Copenhagen Diagnosis, 2009: Updating the World on the Latest Climate Science, , The University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC), Sydney, Australia; Andrews, A., Folger, P., Humphries, M., Copeland, C., Tiemann, M., Meltz, R., Brougher, C., (2009) Unconventional Gas Shales: Development, Technology, and Policy Issues, , http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40894.pdf, Congressional Research Service, (Accessed online 10-05-2013 at:); Asian Carp Control Strategy Framework, , http://asiancarp.us/documents/2011Framework.pdf, Accessed online 10-22-2014 at:; Austin, J., Dezenski, E., Affolter-Caine, B., (2008) The Vital Connection: Reclaiming Great Lakes Economic Leadership in the Bi-national US-Canadian Region, , Metropolitan Policy Program of the Brookings Institution, Washington, DC; Auty, R., (1993) Sustaining Development in Mineral Economies: The Resource Curse Thesis, , Routledge, London, UK; Bailey, S.A., Deneau, M.G., Jean, L., Wiley, C.J., Leung, B., MacIsaac, H.J., Evaluating efficacy of an environmental policy to prevent biological invasions (2011) Environ.

Kahn was a reluctant deregulator of the US interstate airline industry. The 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, which he “fathered,” however, not only ushered in a wave of other similar actions both within and outside of transportation in the United States, but also provided a demonstration effect that resulted in a more general rolling back of microeconomic regulation across the globe. Kahn was head of the US Civil Aeronautics Board for only eighteen months or so, but he brought about considerable changes to the airline industry and, through its spread effects, to all other modes of transportation. Here we focus on the degree to which he actually foresaw, or at least generally predicted, what the outcome of airline deregulation would be. While Kahn himself acknowledged that market outcomes are, almost by definition, unpredictable, he clearly had some ideas of what the results of his would be. Here we look at what he thought would happen, what did happen, and at whether his own short term ex post assessment of outcomes has been of durable accuracy. © 2015 by Duke University Press.",,,,,,,"Alexander, C.R., Lee, Y.-H.A., The Economics of Regulatory Reform: Termination of Airline Computer Reservation System Rules (2004) Yale Journal of Regulation, 21, pp. 369-440; Kahn, A., (2011) Economist, p. 20. , www.economist.com/node/17956457; Averch, H., Johnson, L.L., Behavior of the Firm under Regulatory Constraint (1962) American Economic Review, 52 (5), pp. 1052-1069; Bailey, E.E., Air-Transportation Deregulation (2010) Better Living through Economics, pp. 188-202. , edited by John J.

The image they paint is both coherent and consistent. Education, governance, personal attitudes and societal trends, rather than specific events, are drivers of a future which is perceived as being largely shaped by human choices. Innovation is believed to be more necessary in novel social arrangements than in further technology. The most feared futures arise from an amplification of trends already at play in the present: economic growth at the expense of the environment and quality of life, lack of equity, poor government, corporate greed, commercialism and erosion of social values. Economic and material growth does not feature in the most desired futures which are local, inclusive, peaceful, equitable and in some cases frugal. The visions and scenarios developed find a place within established foresight frameworks and global political narratives, but seem to lie at the fringe of current media and short-term political discourse. These results should not be interpreted as representative of the overall Australian population, but suggest that extending the analysis to the broader community could provide significant insights and enrich the discussion of important societal choices. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Australia's future; Climate change; Economic growth; Future archetypes; Future studies; Narrative analysis; Sustainability","commercialization; economic growth; environmental economics; forecasting method; quality of life; sustainability; technological change; Australia",,,,,"(2010) Australia to 2050: Future Challenges, , Commonwealth of Australia: Canberra, Australia; Coates, J.F., Energy needs, choices, and possibilities, scenarios to 2050 (2002) Technol.

An objectivised selection of a material for research and its surface treatment technology is, therefore, essential in the planning phase of a materials science experiment. A methodology of computer-integrated prediction of development is dedicated to such task, enabling to perform an expert assessment and to present results thereof graphically using contextual matrices being a tool of a quantitative analysis that is very desirable in engineering circles. Considering the three groups of materials, i.e.: steels, casting magnesium alloys and casting aluminum alloys subjected to an expert assessment using a dendrological matrix being an inherent part of materials surface engineering development prediction methods, aluminum casting alloys has achieved the best position. It was further demonstrated that laser treatment is a technology of the highest potential and attractiveness in the context of applying aluminum casting alloys for surface treatment. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Aluminum alloys; Foresight methods; Laser surface treatment; Surface engineering","Alloy steel; Alloys; Aluminum; Aluminum castings; Casting; Industrial research; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium castings; Manufacture; Metal casting; Surface treatment; Aluminum casting alloys; Casting aluminum alloys; Casting magnesium alloy; Foresight methods; Laser surface treatment; Manufacturing technologies; Surface engineering; Surface treatment technology; Aluminum alloys",,,,,"Dobrzański, L.A., Borek, W., Thermo-mechanical treatment of Fe–Mn–(Al, Si) TRIP/TWIP steels (2012) Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, 12, pp. 299-304; Lukaszkowicz, K., Dobrzański, L.A., Kokot, G., Ostachowski, P., Characterization and properties of PVD coatings applied to extrusion dies (2012) Vacuum, 86 (12), pp. 2082-2088; Węgrzyn, T., Piwnik, J., Low alloy welding with micro-jet cooling (2012) Archives of Metallurgy and Materials, 57-2 (1); Tański, T., Structure modelling and properties of the surface of the Mg-Al-Zn alloys (2012) Open Access Library, 2 (8). , (in Polish); Dobrzańska-Danikiewicz, A.D., Tański, T., Domagała-Dubiel, J., Unique properties, development perspectives and expected applications of laser treated casting magnesium alloys (2012) Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, 12 (3), pp. 318-326; Dobrzańska-Danikiewicz, A.D., Computer integrated development prediction methodology in materials surface engineering (2012) Open Access Library, 1 (7). , (in Polish); Labisz, K., Tański, T., Janicki, D., HPDL energy absorption on anodised cast Al-Si-Cu alloys surfaces during remelting (2012) Archives of Foundry Engineering, 12 (2), pp. 45-48; Labisz, K., Tański, T., Dobrzański, L.A., HPDL laser alloying of heat treated Al-Si-Cu alloy (2012) Journal of Archives of Materials Science and Engineering, 54 (1), pp. 13-21; Dobrzański, L.A., Borek, W., Hot-Rolling of advanced high-manganese C-Mn-Si-Al steels (2012) Materials Science Forum, 706-709, pp. 2053-2058","Tański, T.; Silesian University of Technology, Konarskiego St. 18a, Poland","Valiulis A.V.Cernasejus O.Moksin V.",,"Trans Tech Publications Ltd",,,,,16629779,9783038352273,,,"English","Solid State Phenomena",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922164687

This paper seeks to frame model results for policymakers and other consumers of model outputs. In this analysis we compare three models: GCAM, MERGE, and EPPA. We apply diagnostic carbon price scenarios, such as ramps and shocks, to identify key differences in model behavior that drive inter-model variability in projected policy impacts on the U.S. energy system. We report model results using several economic parameterizations and find that variation in carbon emissions across models results primarily from differences in carbon intensity of energy supply. These differences arise because models include different low-carbon energy technology options and vary widely in how flexible the electricity supply sector is at adapting to a change in policy. The timing of emissions abatement is also strongly influenced by whether the model is a simulation or an inter-temporal optimization scheme and the amount of foresight exhibited in the model. Our analysis demonstrates the usefulness of novel IAM diagnostic indicators and clarifies model features that are highly relevant for consumers of model results. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy policy analysis; Integrated assessment; Model comparison","Carbon; Carbon intensity of energies; Diagnostic indicators; Electricity supply sectors; Integrated assessment; Integrated assessment models; Low-carbon energy technology; Model comparison; Policy analysis; Computer simulation; carbon emission; electricity supply; energy policy; integrated approach; modeling; policy analysis; United States",,,,,"Blanford, G., Merrick, J., Richels, R., Rose, S., Trade-offs between mitigation costs and temperature change (2013) Clim.

Four scenarios are offered. First is the Leap-frog or Bypass. In this future, the poorer nations of today, by being less invested in today’s technology, jump over the wealthier nations. They lead in creating novel Internet futures. In the second scenario, Cycles of Violence and Surveillance, the main driver is perceived injustice and the ability to use violence and spectacle to challenge this injustice. Whether through the Internet or the emerging 3D printing technologies or drones, the weak are able to inflict violence on the strong. Third is the Gaia of Civilizations, where the growth of the Internet—speech, access, dispersion—is built upon the fabric of ethical civilization rules. The main driver for this idealistic scenario is the development of a new demographic group—the Cultural Creatives. Last, the Great Disruption, the exact development of the Internet cannot really be predicted in the sense that disruption is built into the net. The main driver in this scenario is technology itself. In this future, we are not at the end of the Internet revolution but merely at its beginning. The future of the Internet is thus multiple. Indeed, most likely all aspects of these scenarios will occur, as well as futures beyond our current imagination. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Alternative futures; Cyberfutures; Foresight; Gaia of cultures",,,,,,"Allon, J., (2015) Pat Robertson Kicks off Islamophobic Reactions to Germanwings Plane Crash, , http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/pat-robertson-kicks-islamophobic-reactions-germanwings-plane-crash; Anderson, M., (2015) Kenya’s Tech Entrepreneurs Shun Konza ‘silicon Savannah, , http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah; Chacos, B., (2013) Meet Darknet, the Hidden, Anonymous Underbelly of the Searchable Web, , http://www.pcworld.com/article/2046227/meet-darknet-the-hidden-anonymous-underbelly-of-the-searchable-web.html; Chandler, B., (2015) Breaking News: German Media Reports Co-Pilot was Muslim Convert, , http://viral.buzz/breaking-news-co-pilot-was-muslim-convert/; Cohan, P., (2011) Diagnostics for All to Heal the Poor with Hybrid Structure, , http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2011/07/18/diagnostics-for-all-to-heal-the-poor-with-hybrid-structure/; Dator, J., What futures for governance?

Automatic generation control is implemented to control power outputs of the generators and stabilize the system frequency. It is desirable with increasing levels of PV penetration to have foresight of frequency fluctuations to empower advanced control systems. A new methodology is presented in this paper for predicting frequency of synchronous generators in a power system with solar PV. A cellular computational network (CCN) is used to perform the frequency prediction over multi-Time scale. CCNs are decentralized and distributed computing paradigms. Thus, CCNs are suitable for fast prediction of frequency of synchronous generators distributed spatially across a power system. The inputs to cells of the CCN are derived from phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements of frequency and voltage phasor at the respective generator buses. Past, current and predicted measurements enable multi-Timescale predictions of synchronous generator frequencies in a power system. Typical multi-Time scale frequency predictions using the CCN are illustrated on a two-Area four machine power system with solar PV integrated. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Solar power generation; Synchronous generators; Units of measurement; Advanced control systems; Automatic generation control; Computational networks; Four-machine power system; Frequency fluctuation; Frequency prediction; Multi machine power system; Prediction of frequency; Phasor measurement units",,,,,"Venayagamoorthy, G.K., Jayawardene, I., Grid Operations with Peneration of Photovoltaic Systems (2015) 2015 Third Southern African Solar Energy Conference, , May; Mbounguia, G., Jimoh, A.A., Ayodele, T.R., On the adaptation of South Africa experience to combine solar energy and smart grid in Namibia (2013) 2013 AFRICON, p. 15. , 9-12, Sept; Zeller, P., Libati, H.M., Utilization of solar energy for electrical power supply in rural African areas (2009) 2009 AFRICON, p. 16. , 23-25, Sept; Schlueter, R.A., Park, G.L., Retford, E., A study of frequency prediction for power systems (1978) IEEE Trans. on Automatica Control, Vol. AC 23, (6), pp. 996-1000. , Feb; Jinfeng, R., Kezunovic, M., A hybrid method for power system frequency estimation (2012) IEEE Trans.

The innovation of the traceability concept consists in the possibility of having information concerning the exact origin of the electricity used for a specific end use, in this case EV charging [8]. The traceability, in a context of increasingly sustainability [9], [10] and smartness city, is an important develop tool because only in this way it is possible to quantify the real emissions produced by EVs and to ensure the real foresight of grid load.

In future, these developments could radically transform the oil, gas, and electricity markets. Therefore there is a greater need for improved forecasting methods that take into account the dynamics of market factors, primarily those related to the use of new technologies. We analyse the difficulties of forecasting demand for liquid fuels in conditions of uncertainty related to future technological developments in car transport. We classify the technologies driving demand for motor fuels by the nature of their impact on the demand for petroleum products: technologies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of traditional cars, as well as drivers of inter-fuel competition, both in terms of direct and indirect substitutes for petroleum products. To resolve the problem of limited input information, the methodology incorporates clustering instruments, which enable us to group countries according to certain criteria. The use of economic and mathematical tools with optimizing units enables us to make integrated calculations that model the market for liquid fuels and assess its interactions with the markets of other energy resources. Our proposed system for forecasting demand for liquid fuels, including petroleum products, can be used as an instrument to assess the future impact of technological innovation on the development of the oil industry when carrying out Foresight studies.","Alternative fuel; Automotive transport; Energy efficiency; Forecast of demand; Oil products; Technology",,,,,,"APS, (2008) Energy Future: Think Efficiency, , College Park, MD: American Physical Society; Behrang, M.A., Assareh, E., Ghalambaz, M., Assari, M.R., Noghrehabadi, A.R., Forecasting future oil demand in Iran using GSA (Gravitational search algorithm) (2011) Energy, 36, pp. 5649-5654; Bhattacharyya, S.C., Timilsina, G.R., (2009) Energy Demand Models for Policy Formulation, , (Policy Research Working Paper), Washington, D.C.: World Bank; Bhattacharyya, S.C., Timilsina, G.R., Modeling energy demand of developing countries: Are the specific features adequately captured?

Research methodology: This study involved close observations of and in-depth interviews with 11 experienced intensive care nurses. The text was analysed using a hermeneutic phenomenological method that was inspired by van Manen. Setting: This study was undertaken at two different high-technology intensive care units (ICUs) in Norwegian university hospitals. Findings: Nurses formed images of individual patients composed of signs (of changes in a patient's condition) that were sensory, measurable, and manifested as the mood of the nurse. The signs may be viewed as separate from and opposed to one another, but they are tightly interwoven and interact with one another. Care situations are powerful stimuli for the patient, and it is of great importance for nurses to become aware of signs in these situations. Nurses also ascribe that following the patient over time is important for becoming aware of signs. Conclusion: An awareness of incipient changes in patient clinical condition requires understanding the ever-changing dynamics of patient condition and dialogic images composed of signs. Care situations and the following of patients through shifts are essential in enabling nurses to detect these signs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Hermeneutics - phenomenological; ICU; Intensive care nurse; Patient conditions; Sensation; Sign","clinical competence; female; human; intensive care nursing; male; Norway; nurse; nursing assessment; perception; qualitative research; Clinical Competence; Critical Care Nursing; Female; Humans; Male; Norway; Nurses; Nursing Assessment; Perception; Qualitative Research",,,,,"Benner, P., Hooper-Kyriakidis, P., Stannard, D., (2011) Clinical wisdom and interventions in acute and critical care: a thinking-in-action approach, , Springer Publishing, New York; Bringsvor, H.B., Bentsen, S.B., Berland, A., Sources of knowledge used by intensive care nurses in Norway: an exploratory study (2014) Intens Crit Care Nurs, 30 (3), pp. 159-166; Dahlberg, K., The essence of essences - the search for meaning structures in phenomenological analysis of lifeworld phenomena (2006) Int J Qual Stud Health Well-Being, 1 (1), pp. 11-19; Dahlberg, K., Dahlberg, H., Nyström, M., (2008) Reflective lifeworld research, , Studentlitteratur, Lund; Dykes, P.C., Rothschild, J.M., Hurley, A.C., Medical errors recovered by critical care nurses (2010) J Nurs Admin, 40 (5), pp. 241-246; Egerod, I., Albarran, J.W., Ring, M., Blackwood, B., Sedation practice in Nordic and non-Nordic ICUs: a European survey (2013) Nurs Crit Care, 18 (4), pp. 166-175; Guttormson, J.L., Bremer, K.L., Jones, R.M., ""Not being able to talk was horrid"": a descriptive, correlational study of communication during mechanical ventilation (2015) Intens Crit Care Nurs, 31, pp. 179-186; Henneman, E.A., Gawlinski, A., Giuliano, K.K., Surveillance: a strategy for improving patient safety in acute and critical care units (2012) Crit Care Nurse, 32 (2), pp. e9-e18; Howell, M.D., Ngo, L., Folcarelli, P., Yang, J., Mottley, L., Marcantonio, E.R., Sustained effectiveness of a primary-team-based rapid response system (2012) Crit Care Med, 40 (9), pp. 2562-2568; Jäderling, G., Calzavacca, P., Bell, M., Martling, C.-R., Jones, D., Bellomo, R., The deteriorating ward patient: a Swedish-Australian comparison (2011) Intens Care Med, 37 (6), pp. 1000-1005; Karlsson, V., Bergbom, I., Forsberg, A., The lived experiences of adult intensive care patients who were conscious during mechanical ventilation: a phenomenological-hermeneutic study (2012) Intens Crit Care Nurs, 28 (1), pp. 6-15; Klepstad, P., Intensivmedisinen og dens utfordringer (2010) Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen, 130 (1), p. 12; Lakanmaa, R.-L., Suominen, T., Perttilä, J., Puukka, P., Leino-Kilpi, H., Competence requirements in intensive and critical care nursing - still in need of definition?

Fiscal austerity in the wake of the Great Recession prompted nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to institute major spending cuts and tax increases, increases that caused political and social fallout for years to come. While economies and budgets have improved in the past several years, significant fiscal adjustments lie ahead due to aging populations and the seemingly inexorable growth of health care costs. Faced with larger cohorts of retirees and fewer workers, nations will have to come to grips with a fiscal reality of higher spending and lower revenues for the foreseeable future. This article examines whether and how fiscal austerity measures are politically stabilizing or destabilizing for elected leaders responsible for their imposition. Many would predict that democracies are ill suited to make these hard choices, and certainly regimes have gone down to defeat following the formulation of austerity programs. However, the record is mixed-many regimes have found strategies to mitigate the political fallout and guarantee reelection in the wake of austerity. While traditional incremental and pluralist politics continue to characterize the budgetary strategies of many systems, major policy reforms have risen to the center of policy agendas elsewhere. While the magnitude of the fiscal crisis prompted the adoption of major policy shifts in hard-pressed nations, such reforms were undergirded by a more volatile policy process featuring the emergence of new pathways to power with greater roles for experts and symbolically compelling ideas.",,,,,,,"Smaghi, L.B., (2013) Austerity: European Democracies against the Wall; Public expenditure reform: Making difficult choices (2014) Fiscal Monitor, p. 5. , Int'l Monetary Fund, (Apr); Marcel, M., Budgeting for fiscal space and government performance beyond the great recession (2014) Oecd J. on Budgeting, 13 (9), p. 15; Krugman, P., This can't go on (2003) N.Y.

Plato represents the demiurge as being guided by his own planning or calculation (logismos: Tim. 30b, 34a-b) about how to bring about maximally good order in the cosmos he produces. Indeed, it seems that the demiurge’s causal power with respect to our cosmos is labelled ‘foresight’ or ‘providence’ (pronoia: Tim. 30b-c) precisely to reflect the claim that benevolent divine planning is explanatory of various features of the physical world. Among Platonists of the early empire, planning was widely understood (on Plato’s authority) to be an integral aspect of the demiurge’s creative activity. Plotinus, however, dissents sharply from the earlier Platonist tradition on this point. He argues that divine reason (nous) cannot make plans of any sort concerning the physical cosmos, or indeed entertain any thoughts whatsoever about physical realities. This leaves Plotinus with the challenge of developing an alternative account of how divine intellectual activity determines and guarantees-as he affirms it does-a ‘providentially’ optimal world order. The bulk of this chapter will discuss Plotinus’ case against the view that the cosmos is the product of demiurgic planning and the alternative account of divine providence that he proposes in that view’s stead. But it will be useful to begin by briefly focusing attention on the picture of divine planning presented in the Timaeus, because Plotinus’ dissenting story about providence can plausibly be taken to be motivated by a desire to resolve tensions internal to Platonism that arise in connection with this picture. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107447974; 9781107061538,,,"English","Causation and Creation in Late Antiquity",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952762251

This article empirically studies complexity in forest management decision-making. In contrast to what is often assumed in the literature, this article starts by assuming that complexity does not just consist of an external descriptive element, but also depends on how decision-makers perceive the system at hand. This ""perceived complexity"" determines decision-making. We used a straightforward interpretation of perceived complexity using two criteria: the number of factors considered and the uncertainty perceived about these factors. The results show that Dutch forest managers generally consider forest management decision-making to be complicated (many factors to consider) rather than complex (many uncertain factors to consider). Differences in sources of complexity confirm the individual character of perceived complexity. The factors perceived to be most relevant for decision-making (the forest itself, the organization's objective, the cost of management, public opinion, national policies and laws, and new scientific insights and ideas) are generally seen as rather certain, although ""complexity reduction"" may play a role that can adversely affect the quality of decision-making. Additional use of more open-ended, forward-looking methods, such as qualitative foresight tools, might enable addressing uncertainty and complexity, and thereby enhance decision-making in forest management to prepare for increasing complexity in the future. © 2015 by the authors.","Complicatedness; Decision-making; Forestry; The Netherlands; Uncertainty","Forestry; Managers; Social aspects; Complexity reduction; Complicatedness; Management decision-making; National policies; Netherlands; Number of factors; Uncertainty; Uncertainty and complexity; Decision making; complexity; decision making; forest management; forestry; perception; uncertainty analysis; Netherlands",,,,,"Rayner, J., Preface (2010) In Embracing Complexity: Meeting the Challenges of International Forest Governance, 28, p. 3. , http://www.iufro.org/publications/series/world-series/article/2011/01/24/new-gfep-assessment-report-iufro-world-series-28/, Rayner, J., Buck, A., Katila, P., Eds.; International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO): Vienna, (accessed on 28 July 2015).Switzerland; Mollinga, P.P., Boundary work and the complexity of natural resources management (2010) Crop Sci, 50; Kohm, K.A., Franklin, J.F., (1997) Creating a Forestry for the 21st Century: The Science of Ecosystem Management, , Island Press: Washington, DC, USA; Allen, G.M., Gould, E.M., Jr., Complexity, wickedness and public forests (1986) J.

Risk management deals with the issue of uncertainty. In particular it aims to reduce uncertainty by envisioning possible scenarios and making forecasts on the basis of what it is considered probable within a range of possibilities. For this reason in order to properly adapt the risk management process to the field of architectural design it is necessary to understand the meaning and the relationship between: uncertainty, probability, range of possibilities and foresight. Moreover, it is also necessary to make clear the state of the art with reference to risk management process, as regards: terms, definitions, steps and methods. The risk management process has been defined many times and many different versions have been given over the last decades. In the current context the voluntary standards have unified terms, definitions, frameworks and steps of the process of risk management. The framework offered by the International Standards is particularly important in order to systematize knowledge from literature from various fields and to create a common ground to deal without either misunderstanding or ambiguity. Finally, applications of the risk management process in various context are reported and is introduced the possibility of using such approach in architectural design to control risks over building use and maintenance is introduced. * © The Author(s) 2015.","Monte Carlo simulation; Probability; Risk; Risk assessment; Risk management; Uncertainty","Architectural design; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Probability; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Uncertainty analysis; Common ground; International standards; Risk management process; State of the art; Uncertainty; Risk management",,,,,"Baker, S., Ponniah, D., Techniques for the analysis of risks in major projects (1998) J.

This paper indicates their pros and cons as alternatives to “real” money and explains their appearance as the reflection of the present trends. It also presents the possible scenarios of their development. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on the former foresight research results and literature review. It highlights the main trends in contemporary economy and their impact on financial services. The Bitcoin case is the starting point for the virtual currencies’ market analysis and construction of possible market changes scenarios. Findings – Virtual currency schemes are the reflection of present trends. They are just ahead of our times but may become a common means of payment, changing the way of providing financial services, eliminating intermediaries and marginalizing the role of financial institutions. Research limitations/implications – The multiplicity of virtual currencies and ceaseless introduction of innovations impede the presentation of the complete market picture. The lack of reliable statistical data makes the estimation of the market growth difficult. Practical implications – This paper indicates influence of technology development, virtualization and networking on payment systems’ functioning. Social implications – This paper shows the impact of environmental changes on consumers’ acceptance of virtual currencies. Originality/value – The virtual currency as a payment system is quite new and still a marginalized phenomenon. Nevertheless, the pace of virtual currency market growth after its recent introduction and appearance of Bitcoin successors seems to be the signs of future changes in financial service sector. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Financial services; Forecasting; Information society; Internet; Scenario planning",,,,,,"Anderson, C.H., (2010) Free: How Today's Smartest Businesses Profit by Giving Something for Nothing, pp. 165-237. , Hyperion, New York, NY; Aron, J., (2012) Virtual economy looms as digital cash grows up, pp. 22-23. , New Scientist, 24 November; Bank for International Settlements, (2001) Core Principles for Systematically Important Payment Systems, pp. 6-10. , www.bis.org/publ/cpss43.pdf, (accessed 11 August 2013).

With that purpose, the possibility that various complications occur must be assumed always. Perforating artery injuries can occur due to failure to recognize clip co– occlusion, or kinking at its origin, or pulling it up, and so on. Therefore, it is very important for the operator to observe well and to adequately exfoliate in order to prevent these troubles. A technique where by the dissecting manipulation can be completed safely is also needed. Clip insertion in a free direction and the delicate adjustment of the clipping line are necessary to avoid a stenosis of the a parent artery or branching artery by clipping. At the same time, it is important to obtain sufficient mobility of the aneurysm and the branching arteries. This mobility leads to both good visibility and safe operation. A large surgical field realizes a free visual axis and an adequate manipulation angle. Thorough dissection without compromise leads to a safe and successful outcome. It is also important to preserve all veins as much as possible by denuding to avoid venous infarction or hemorrhage. In a complicated aneurysm such as a large sized or sclerotic aneurysm, a conbined procedure including an arterial bypass should be selected. In this type of bypass combined surgery, intraoperative measurement of the arterial blood flow using a transit-time flowmeter will be very useful. © 2015 Japanese Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

While sustainability connotes survival, excellence is the capacity to thrive across critical performance domains. Enter resilience and robustness. Resilience is enterprise ability to self-renew through innovation, changing and reinventing itself by adapting its responses to political, social, economic and other competitive shocks or challenges. Robustness is enterprise resistance or immunity gained through strategies, policies, partnerships, and practices that maintain or advance competitive position when shocks or challenges arise. Resistance as herein constructed is a composition or blend of revival, striving, surviving and thriving. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – A sustainable enterprise excellence, resilience and robustness (SEER2) model and assessment regime is proposed. SEER2 integrates excellence and sustainability principles, methodologies, and standards to optimize enterprise performance across the triple bottom line people, planet, and profit domains. Findings – A Springboard to SEER2 model blending simplicity, applicability, and usability by a range of enterprises is introduced. Its enablers include data analytics and intelligence, human ecology, and social-ecological innovation. Springboard technology includes an assessment regime that yields actionable feedback and foresight. These inform next generation strategy, activities and performance that support identification and implementation of best and next best practices and sources of competitive advantage. Practical implications – The Springboard to SEER2 enterprise self-assessment approach restricts itself to sustainability, excellence, resilience and robustness considerations. Originality/value – A model integrating SEER2 in relation to strategic resistance is introduced. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business excellence; Business performance; Innovation; Modelling; Self-assessment; Sustainability",,,,,,"Al-Najjar, B., Anfimiadou, A., Environmental policies and firm value (2012) Business Strategy and the Environment, 21 (2), pp. 49-59; Arnaud, A., Sekerka, L.E., Positively ethical: The establishment of innovation in support of sustainability (2010) International Journal of Sustainable Strategic Management, 2 (2), pp. 121-137; Atkinson, G., Hamilton, K., Progress along the path: Evolving issues in the measurement of genuine saving (2007) Environmental and Resource Economics, 37 (1), pp. 43-61; Bendor, J.B., Kumar, S., Siegel, D.A., Satisficing: A ‘pretty good heuristic” (2009) The BE Journal of Theoretical Economics, 9 (1), pp. 1-36; Birkin, F., Polesie, T., An epistemic analysis of (Un)sustainable business (2011) Journal of Business Ethics, 103 (2), pp. 239-253; Boons, F., Wagner, M., Assessing the relationship between economic and ecological performance: Distinguishing system levels and the role of innovation (2009) Ecological Economics, 68 (7), pp. 1908-1914; Bou-Llusar, J., Escrig-Tena, A., Roca-Puig, V., Beltrán-Martín, I., An empirical assessment of the EFQM excellence model: Evaluation as a TQM framework relative to the MBNQA model (2009) Journal of Operations Management, 27 (1), pp. 1-22; Brynjolfsson, E., Hu, Y., Simester, D., Goodbye pareto principle, hellow long tail: The effect of search costs on the concentration of product sales (2011) Management Science, 57 (8), pp. 1373-1386; Burgelman, R.A., Grove, A.S., Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos – repeatedly: Managing strategic dynamics for corporate longevity (2007) Strategic Management Journal, 28 (10), pp. 965-979; Cafaro, P., Crist, E., (2012) Life on the Brink: Environmentalists Confront Overpopulation, , University of Georgia Press, Athens, GA; Castka, P., Balzarova, M., A critical look on quality through CSR lenses: Key challenges stemming from the development of ISO 26000 (2007) International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 24 (7), pp. 738-752; Chen, H., Chiang, R., Storey, V.C., Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1165-1188; Closs, D.J., Speier, C., Meacham, N., Sustainability to support end-to-end value chains: The role of supply chain management (2011) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 39 (1), pp. 101-116; Contu, D.L., How resilience works (2002) Harvard Business Review, 80 (3), pp. 46-52; Costanza, R., The value of natural and social capital in our current full world and in a sustainable and desirable future (2012) Sustainability Science: The Emerging Paradigm and the Urban Environment, pp. 99-109. , in Weinstein, M.P. and Turner, R.E, Springer, New York, NY; Das, R.N., Lin, D.K., Optimal robust designs for lifetime improvement experiments (2011) Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, 141 (12), pp. 3753-3759; Diekmann, A., Volunteers dilemma” (1985) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 29 (4), pp. 605-610; Dixon, S., Clifford, A., Ecopreneurship – a new approach to managing the triple bottom line (2007) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 20 (3), pp. 326-345; Edgeman, R., Business excellence and sustainable development: BEST integration (2001) Quality Australia, 16 (1), pp. 27-30; Edgeman, R., Synergy for the human heart: Excellence and sustainability at the crossroads (2003) AI and Society, 17 (2), pp. 200-202; Edgeman, R., Sustainable enterprise excellence: Towards a framework for holistic dataanalytics (2013) Corporate Governance, 13 (5), pp. 527-540; Edgeman, R., Eskildsen, J., Modeling and assessing sustainable enterprise excellence (2014) Business Strategy and the Environment, 23 (3), pp. 173-187; Edgeman, R., Eskildsen, J., Social-ecological innovation (2014) Encyclopedia of Business Analytics and Optimization, 4, pp. 532-543. , in Wang, J.

Arg. 4,580 ff., where the ship speaks through the keel, which was before a sacred oak in Dodona: This explains why she disposes of prophetic faculties that are not unusual in the mythologic tradition for Argo herself and for the divine Medea, who becomes an angel of Gods, bringing messages of material or spiritual type: The warning and the wholesome advice are the same: To look for Circe, priestess of Hekate in order to get purified. It is clear that the texts are similar and that the intertextual convergence between Her. 121 and Orph. Arg. 1159 is specific and can be attributed to the elements suitable to prove that in the small poem persists an extra-Apollonian myth known to Ovid, Seneca and other Latin authors, that could help to solve some exegetic questions in the 12th Herois and could also confirm the anthropologic and literary coherence to the Argonautic logos of Ovid, also thanks to its marked Orphic characters.",,,,,,,"Dodds, R., (1997) Greci E L'irrazionale, , Firenze; Leclercq, B., (1974) Histoire de la Divination dans L'Antiquit, , Darmstadt; Nasonis, P.O., (1898) Heroides with Greek Translation of Planudes, p. 221. , A.

We have recently demonstrated that a targeted delivery of Dd-MRP4 (Dictyostelium mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4) suppresses specifically the proliferation of the human cancer cells, by inducing their apoptotic cell death (Chida et al., 2014, doi:10.1186/1475-2867-14-56). This amazing fact was discovered, simply based on the finding that Dd-MRP4 expression is absolutely required for transition of Dictyostelium cells from growth to differentiation (Chida et al., 2008, doi:10.1186/1471-2156-9-25; Maeda et al., 2013, doi:10.3390/biom3040943). Dd-MRP4 protein has quite unique structural characters, in that it is highly basic (pI: about 11.5) and interestingly has several nuclear-localization signals within the molecule. In this review, we introduce briefly the efficacy of several apoptosis-inducing substances reported thus far for cancer therapy, and speculate the possible mechanisms, by which apoptosis is specifically induced by Dd-MRP4, on the basis of its structural uniqueness. We also discuss several issues to be solved for the medical application of ectopically expressed Dd-MRP4 in human cancer cells. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Apoptosis; Cancer therapy; Cell differentiation; Dd-MRP4 (Dictyostelium mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4); Dictyostelim discoideum; Human cancer cells; MicroRNA (miRNA); Mitochondria","alpha tocopherol; apoptin; apoptosis inducing factor; artemisinin; cisplatin; Dictyostelium mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4; messenger RNA; microRNA; protein p53; ribosome protein; unclassified drug; protozoal protein; ribosomal protein S4; ribosome protein; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer therapy; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; human; nonhuman; protein expression; protein localization; protein structure; amino acid sequence; chemistry; cytology; Dictyostelium; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrion; molecular genetics; Neoplasms; pathology; Dictyostelium; Amino Acid Sequence; Apoptosis; Dictyostelium; Humans; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Neoplasms; Protozoan Proteins; Ribosomal Proteins",,"alpha tocopherol, 1406-18-4, 1406-70-8, 52225-20-4, 58-95-7, 59-02-9; apoptin, 264888-91-7; artemisinin, 63968-64-9; cisplatin, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; Protozoan Proteins; ribosomal protein S4; Ribosomal Proteins",,,"Bhavsar, R.B., Makley, L.N., Tsonis, P.A., The other lives of ribosomal proteins (2010) Hum.

Vincent Auriol, Paris, 75013, France","In France, the horse population has been increasing since 1995, and reached 950,000 horses in 2010. This represents about 15% of the current total horse population in Europe. This growth is the result of the development of pony-riding for children and the increasing interest of French people in recreational riding and in horserace betting. These changes create new opportunities for various sections of the horse industry, especially in the context of declining government support, increasing international competition in the horse market, social changes with regard to animal welfare, decreasing horsemeat consumption, and the harmonisation of regulations across the European Union. To understand new possible directions for research and for public policy, and also to help horse industry stakeholders prepare for future change, the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), in cooperation with the French Institute for Horse and Riding (IFCE), conducted a joint scenario-building exercise for the French horse industry to 2030. The study's basis was a 'morphological analysis', a method that explores past and current trends and potential shifts to consider possible future developments. It led to four strongly contrasting longterm scenarios ('Everyone on horseback', 'The high-society horse', 'The civic horse', and 'The companion horse'), which differed in terms of horses' uses, horse populations, and employment opportunities. However, all scenarios raised common concerns with regard to (1) the relationship between humans and horses; (2) economic efficiency; (3) environmental issues; (4) the preservation of horse breeds; (5) land-use pressures; and (6) the health, welfare, and care of animals up to and beyond death. These questions call for new research developments in the fields of animal behaviour, economic and social sciences, breeding, and genetic improvement. They also emphasize the need to enhance knowledge and innovation transfer. © Wageningen Academic Publishers 2015.","Foresight; France; Future; Horse; Horse industry",,,,,,"Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K.-H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario types and techniques: towards a user's guide.

To do so the Competency Assurance Management System (CAMS) program will be presented along with how it has helped integrate the Emarati workforce into ADCO's culture. Additionally, the Career Ladder and Succession Planning processes will also be presented to shed light on how they have helped in creating a foresight in terms of career development for the national workforce. The first section of the paper will focus on the challenging nature of Emiritization. It will answer the question of what challenges the mandate of Emiritization brought to companies it was imposed on and how they adopted to challenge. The following section of the paper will then focus on the Competency Assurance Management System. The section is divided into three different subsections, the first subsection will focus on the structures of the CAMS, the second subsection will focus on the overall challenges the CAMS faced and finally the last subsection will focus on the value CAMS brings to ADCO. The third section of the paper then illustrates the continuous development of Emaratis within ADCO even after they have completed the CAMS. The section is divided into two subsections one that focuses on the Career Ladder profiles meanwhile the other focuses on the Succession Planning profiles. Flowingly, section four discusses what can be observed from the previous sections and illustrates how the Emarati workforce has changed its perspectives. Finally then the paper is concluded with a discussion on the set of challenges that ADCO might face in the future and the different methods it might adopt in order to face those challenges.

The proposed methodological approach and the relevant selected results of the research carried out using neural networks and contextual matrices are presented. Contextual matrices were used for the graphical presentation of a strategic position of the critical materials surface engineering technologies. Critical technologies are such having best development prospects and/or key significance in industry. For the purpose of preparing forecasts and analyses, expert studies were carried out with the e-Delphix method using information technology. The probabilistic multivariant scenarios of future events concerning materials surface engineering were created based on the data acquired from experts according to the results of computer simulations made using artificial neural networks. The original data from the experts also served to perform further investigations into the importance of the new technologies, according to the new approach, and the correctness of such approach was verified by comparing the results of heuristic research with the results of classical materials science research for 35 diverse technology groups. The strategic positions of 140 critical materials surface engineering technologies were determined by acting in consistency with the new approach and using own software and custom conceptual matrices. Hidden expert knowledge was thus converted, using the analytical tools and quantitative methods dedicated to this task, into a publicly available open knowledge. The relevant technologies were described and characterized by harmonized criteria using roadmaps and technology information sheets. The new approach described in this chapter, supported with extended information technology, is suitable for direct applications in other areas of knowledge while maintaining economically reasonable costs. © Springer-Verlag London 2015.

Since the 80s two lineages of type B viruses are co – circulating in the world. Antigenic differences between them are important and it leads to lack of cross-reactivity. The impact on the burden of disease due to influenza B virus, poor foresight in estimating which of the two lineages of B viruses circulate in the season, and the consequent lack of immunity in case of including the wrong strain make that the availability of the quadrivalent vaccine is very useful. The aim of this paper is to analyze the past influenza seasons in Spain to assess the burden of disease, divergence between the vaccine strain and the circulating B and viral characteristics associated with type B in each seasonal epidemic. Material and methods. Review of all reports issued by the Influenza Surveillance System in Spain since the 2003-2004 season to 2012-2013. Results. Over the past influenza seasons, although type A was present mostly, circulation of influenza B virus in each season was observed, even being co - dominant in some of them. In a high number of seasons the divergence between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain lineage has been observed Conclusions. The protective effect of influenza vaccine has varied depending on the type / subtype of influenza virus studied. The vaccine effectiveness against influenza infection by influenza B virus has varied greatly depending on the season analyzed. © 2015, Sociedad Espanola de Quiminoterapia.

The producer plays an essential role in filmmaking, as they provide the funding required to turn out quality blockbusters for cinemagoers. Film production is a risky business, as illustrated by the examples of films that fail to cover costs every year. In this respect, tools capable of predicting movie profitability are of potential use to producers as a decision-making tool for deciding whether or not to produce a movie project. In this paper we report a study using historical data on over 100 films produced in the United States (including their genre, opening month, duration, budget, etc.). Decision trees were extracted from these data in order to forecast whether or not a film will be profitable even before it is produced. Decision trees are models commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence as decision support tools. The results show that the resulting model forecasts whether or not a movie will be profitable with an accuracy of over 70%, and this model can be used as a decision support tool for film producers. The proposed approach is not designed to be used as a standalone tool; it should rather round out other forecasting methods, including producers' foresight and judgement. The approach presented here could be equally applicable to other branches of the entertainment business, such as the music or video game industries.","Data mining; Decision Support Systems; Decision trees; Movie industry; Movie profitability prediction","Artificial intelligence; Automatic teller machines; Budget control; Data mining; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Forestry; Motion pictures; Profitability; Trees (mathematics); Decision making tool; Decision support tools; Entertainment industry; Film production; Forecasting methods; Historical data; Movie industry; Video game industry; Decision trees; Algorithms; Decision Making; Market Research; Profitability",,,,,"Pascal, B., Pensées, p. 1662. , Baltimore-Penguin Books; Fayyad, U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview (1996) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1-34. , eds.

In this regard, it is required to develop a reliable decision support system for sustainable generation expansion planning under a good understanding of the aforementioned issues. Game theoretic models as decision support tools have recently received increasing attention from many researchers in this field; however, they assume the supplier entities make a long-term strategic plan with perfect foresight in a certain problem environment, without considering inter-temporal dynamics of market and effects of demand side interactions on generation expansion decisions. In this paper, we propose a two-side multi-agent based modeling framework which undertakes these tasks using a hybrid simulation approach of game theory and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). A Case Study of Iran's power system is used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed planning approach and also to discuss its efficiency. The results showed that the proposed integrated approach provides not only an economical generation expansion plan but also a cleaner one compared to the game theoretic approach. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Over time, research on C. elegans has expanded to explore a wealth of diverse areas in modern biology including studies of the basic functions and interactions of eukaryotic cells, host–parasite interactions, and evolution. C. elegans has also become an important organism in which to study processes that go awry in human diseases. This primer introduces the organism and the many features that make it an outstanding experimental system, including its small size, rapid life cycle, transparency, and well-annotated genome. We survey the basic anatomical features, common technical approaches, and important discoveries in C. elegans research. Key to studying C. elegans has been the ability to address biological problems genetically, using both forward and reverse genetics, both at the level of the entire organism and at the level of the single, identified cell. These possibilities make C. elegans useful not only in research laboratories, but also in the classroom where it can be used to excite students who actually can see what is happening inside live cells and tissues. © 2015 Corsi, Wightman, and Chalfie.","C. elegans; Nematodes; Primer; Single-cell analysis; Transparent genetic system","Article; Caenorhabditis elegans; cell fusion; developmental biology; digestive system; embryo development; evolution; extracellular matrix; gene mutation; genetic difference; genetic manipulation; genetic model; hermaphrodite; host parasite interaction; microbial community; microbial genome; microbial growth; molecular biology; nematode life cycle stage; nervous system; neurobiology; nonhuman; organogenesis; pathogenesis; phenotype; priority journal; reverse genetics; self fertilization; single cell analysis; wound healing; animal; biology; Caenorhabditis elegans; genome; history; human; physiology; research; Caenorhabditis elegans; Eukaryota; Nematoda; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biology; Caenorhabditis elegans; Genome; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Research",,,,,"Ahringer, J., (2006), http://www.wormbook.org, Reverse genetics (April 6, 2006), WormBook, ed.

The emergence of EIDs has been associated with interconnected economic, social and environmental changes. Understanding these changes is crucial for EID preparedness and subsequent prevention and control of EID events. The aim of this review is to describe tools currently available for identification, prioritization and investigation of EIDs impacting human and animal health, and how these might be integrated into a systematic approach for directing EID preparedness. Environmental scanning, foresight programmes, horizon scanning and surveillance are used to collect and assess information for rapidly responding to EIDs and to anticipate drivers of emergence for mitigating future EID impacts. Prioritization of EIDs-using transparent and repeatable methods-based on disease impacts and the importance of those impacts to decision-makers can then be used for more efficient resource allocation for prevention and control. Risk assessment and simulation modelling methods assess the likelihood of EIDs occurring, define impact and identify mitigation strategies.

Today, sustainability is no longer considered a buzzword, but a reality that should be applied in policy, practice and management of all sectors of society. It's a cornerstone needed by humans to live decently within their own conception of welfare, with respect to others without compromising the ecosystem as well as social and cultural norms. The pursuit of sustainable development puts the construction industry at the forefront both globally and nationally due to its total energy, resource consumption and carbon emission. However, the industry is identified as one of driving forces of the nations' economy because of its contribution in generating wealth through constant growth in GDP. In addition, it influences the development of social and economic infrastructures and provides job opportunities. Based on the findings, most of the construction work in Malaysia and in the rest of the world is still applying conventional methods which are not often sustainable. However, IBS has capabilities to be considered as a vital pillar in helping the government to attain sustainable development when there is a need to balance economic growth, social expansion and environmental protection. For achieving these gaols it is necessary that more legislation, incentives and financial supports be considered and launched in the construction industry and governments exploit their foresight regarding this transition to maximize the potential benefits through policies supporting the development of the private demand for and supply of activities which meet this agenda. And, all initiatives need to be taken forward simultaneously by cooperation from all stakeholders. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2015.","Green construction; IBS; Malaysia; Sustainability",,,,,,"Architects and Climate Change (2007), http://www.aia.org; Badir, Y.F., Kadir, M.R.A., Hashim, A.H., Industrialised building system construction in Malaysia (2002) J.

Epistemology is ""the study or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge especially with reference to its limits and validity."" The three epistemologies referred to in this paper are artifact-oriented, process-oriented and autopoietic-oriented (Christensen & Bang, 2003). This paper advocates the third way to look at the process of knowledge management via the autopoietic epistemology. Autopoiesis is a theory rooted in neurobiology, but it was later developed into a theory about social systems such as employees, project teams or organizations. Subsequently, it was introduced in organizational theory and in knowledge management theory. Following this epistemological theory a synthesis of knowledge management summarizes seven critical strategies for knowledge utilization within a firm (Backer, 1991; Shaperman & Backer, 1995). These strategies have empirically proved effective in meeting the knowledge utilization challenges. These strategies are interpersonal contact, planning and conceptual foresight, external consultation, user-oriented translation of information, individual or organizational championship, individual ownership and involvement and individual promotion Also, using the mapping concept it is possible to scan all the organization's projects and activities and allocate the strategy ownership to individual participants using activity mapping, determining goal relevance and conflicts, and assessing the strategic importance to organization. As per contingency approaches this maximizes knowledge utilization using both environmental and organizational coordinates. Thus these seven knowledge management strategies enabling autopoietic knowledge management epistemology lead to higher innovation in organization as found in an exploratory study conducted in a project group in an organization!

Global and national trends of information resources market have been considered, the classification of information resources by industries has been given. On the basis of the characteristics and current trends in the use of information resources hypotheses have been put forward: Russian companies focused on the domestic market, use mostly Russian information resources; most Russian companies are characterized by high information protection; Russia is in transition to informational economy which leads to the need for industries to new storage technologies and exchange of information; demand for national research publications is formed only in a narrow segment of businesses. Also methods of analysis and forecasting of information needs have been considered, the main disadvantages, advantages, opportunities and threats of each method of research have been identified: bibliometric analysis, sciencemetrics, webmetrics, patent research, foresight, scenario analysis, marketing research. It was found that during the study of the needs of industries and organizations, it is important to consider the type of information, language, scope of activities pertaining to the information resource, the level of socio-economic development of the country as a whole, the level of knowledge economy. On the basis of the analysis guidelines for conducting market research of information needs have been suggested. They take into account both retrospective information on information resources and behavioral component. In this study for the first time criteria characterizing the motives of management decision-making on the use of information resources in domestic enterprises have been introduced. © Medwell Journals, 2015.","Branches of industry; Economic-mathematical methods; Enterprises; Expert methods; Information needs; Information resources; Information Technologies (IT) research tools; Research methods; The international and national market of information resources",,,,,,"Ayvazian, S.A., Brodsky, B.E., Macroeconomic modeling: approaches, problems, an example of the econometric model of Russian economy (2006) J.

Each of them strives to provide new answers to the question, What challenges await Data Design? To avoid falling into too narrow a mind-set, each works hard to elucidate the breadth of Data Design today and to demonstrate its widespread application across a variety of business sectors. With end users in mind, designer-contributors bring to light the myriad of purposes for which the field was originally intended, forging the bond even further between Data Design and the aims and intentions of those who contribute to it. The first seven parts of the book outline the scope of Data Design, and presents a line-up of viewpoints that highlight this disciplines main topics, and offers an in-depth look into practices boasting both foresight and imagination. The eighth and final part features a series of interviews with Data designers and artists whose methods embody originality and marked singularity. As a result, a number of enlightening concepts and bright ideas unfold within the confines of this book to help dispel the thick fog around this new and still relatively unknown discipline. A plethora of equally eye-opening and edifying new terms, words, and key expressions also unfurl. Informing, influencing, and inspiring are just a few of the buzz words belonging to an initiative that is, first and foremost, a creative one, not to mention the possibility to discern the ever-changing and naturally complex nature of todays datasphere.

We confront this question by developing an approach based on trends and networks of vital variables, analyzed by bibliometrics, which endeavours to detect fruitful trajectories of nanotechnology applied to ground-breaking anti-cancer treatments. Results tend to show two main technological waves of cancer treatments by nanotechnology applications. The early technological wave in the early 2000s was embodied in some types of chemotherapy agents with a broad spectrum of application, while after 2006 the second technological wave appeared with new applications of chemotherapy agents and molecular target therapy by nanotechnology. The present study shows new directions of nanotechnology-based chemotherapy and molecular cancer therapy in new treatments for breast, lung, brain and colon cancers. A main finding of this study is the recognition that, since the late 2000s, the sharp increase of several technological trajectories of anticancer drugs applied by nanotechnology seems to be driven by high rates of mortality of some types of cancers (e.g. pancreatic and brain) in order to find more effective anticancer therapies that increase the progression-free survival of patients: the so-called technological trajectories mortality driven. The study also points out that global research leaders tend to specialize in anticancer drugs, via nanotechnology, for specific cancers (e.g. Switzerland in prostate cancer, Japan in colon cancer, China in ovarian cancer and Greece in pancreatic cancer). These ground-breaking technological trajectories are paving new directions in biomedicine and generating a revolution in clinical practice that may lead to more effective anticancer treatments in the not-too-distant future. © 2014 Elsevier Inc..","Bibliometrics; Biomedicine; Cancer; Chemotherapy; Mortality driven; Nanomedicine; Nanoscience; Nanotechnology; Publications; Radical innovation; Target therapy; Technological paradigm; Technological trajectories","Chemotherapy; Information science; Medical nanotechnology; Nanoscience; Nanotechnology; Oncology; Technological forecasting; Trajectories; Bibliometrics; Biomedicine; Cancer; Mortality driven; Publications; Radical innovation; Technological paradigm; Diseases; cancer; chemotrophy; disease treatment; innovation; medicine; mortality; nanotechnology",,,,,"Arora, S.K., Porter, A.L., Youtie, J., Shapira, P., Capturing new developments in an emerging technology: an updated search strategy for identifying nanotechnology research outputs (2013) Scientometrics, 95 (1), pp. 351-370; Ayres, R.U., Towards a disequilibrium theory of endogenous economic growth (1998) Environ.

Fanciful notions that soon fell into oblivion are mentioned such as Paracelsus and van Helmont substituting Galen's black bile by mysterious ens or archeus systems. Likewise, unfortunate episodes such as Virchow claiming Remak's hypotheses as his own remind us that human shortcomings can affect otherwise excellent scientists. However, age-old benchmark observations, hypotheses, and practices of historic and scientific interest are underscored, excerpts included, as precursors of recent discoveries that shaped modern medicine. Examples include: Petit's total mastectomy with excision of axillary glands for breast cancer; a now routine practice, Peyrilhe's ichorous matter a cancer-causing factor he tested for transmissibility one century before Rous confirmed the virus-cancer link, Hill's warning of the dangers of tobacco snuff; heralding today's cancer pandemic caused by smoking, Pott reporting scrotum cancer in chimney sweepers; the first proven occupational cancer, Velpeau's remarkable foresight that a yet unknown subcellular element would have to be discovered in order to define the nature of cancer; a view confirmed by cancer genetics two centuries later, ending with Röntgen and the Curies, and Gilman et al. ushering radiation (1896, 1919) and medical oncology (1942), respectively. © 2014 UICC.","Cancer; History; Landmarks; Milestones; Pioneers","chlormethine; biological warfare; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer growth; cancer radiotherapy; Egypt; fossil animal; Greece; history of medicine; human; Italy; knowledge base; lymphosarcoma; malignant neoplastic disease; malignant transformation; mastectomy; medical literature; metastasis; nonhuman; prehistoric period; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; Review; scientist; scrotum cancer; scrotum disorder; traditional medicine; animal; factual database; Neoplasms; pathology; Animals; Databases, Factual; Humans; Neoplasms",,"chlormethine, 51-75-2, 55-86-7, 82905-71-3",,,"Rothschild, B.M., Tanke, D.H., Helbling, M., II, Epidemiologic study of tumors in dinosaurs (2003) Naturwissenschaften, 90, pp. 495-500; (2012) The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, , http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/smith/smith.html, An ancient Medical Treasure at your fingertips.

Professor Justin Fisher of the Magna Carta Institute at Brunel and Jennifer Hudson of the PSA Executive asked me to organise a conference and a book, and I willingly agreed. It could have been a challenge to find something new to say about Magna Carta, but thanks to the contributors to this volume, I am confident that we have succeeded. So my first thanks go to them, for finding the time to write very interesting chapters and for coming to the United Kingdom to discuss their contributions with each other at a workshop held at the Constitution Unit in the School of Public Policy at UCL in June 2014. Thanks must also go to the others who attended the workshop - Conor Gearty, Clodagh Harris, George Jones and Colin Munro - for their comments on the draft chapters; and thanks to our administrator, Ben Webb, for organising it with his usual enthusiasm and efficiency. We also express special thanks to the interns who have supported this project: Annabelle Huet, Daniel Helen and Chrysi Kalfa. Daniel's expertise as a medieval historian was particularly valuable. For including the book in the Cambridge University Press series on comparative constitutional law and policy, we thank the editors, Zachary Elkins, Tom Ginsburg and Ran Hirschl. Our thanks also go to the anonymous reviewers of our book proposal and to John Berger, our editor at Cambridge. And we thank the PSA for funding the project and paying for the workshop in 2014 and the conference to launch the book in 2015. Without the PSA's foresight and support, this book would not have happened. I reserve my last but warmest thanks to my colleague and co-editor James Melton. He has done all the hard work and ensured that everyone delivered on time (a first in my experience of edited books); he did so throughout with tact, good humour and quiet efficiency. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,,,,,,"Hazell, R.; School of Public Policy, University College LondonUnited Kingdom",,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781316285718; 9781107112773,,,"English","Magna Carta and its Modern Leg.",Editorial,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954304818

This liveliness is reflected in some of the empirical challenges that have emerged recently, the resolution of which will likely motivate much research in the field for the foreseeable future. To understand the sources of these challenges and to suggest ways for their resolution, it is necessary to take stock of the history of empirical aesthetics to examine the contributions of major trends in thinking to our current models of how the mind creates aesthetic and artistic products, and how it goes about interacting with them. Of necessity, this historical overview will be selective, focusing on only major thinkers and trends (for more detailed reviews of various epochs see Beebe-Center, 1932; Cupchik, 1986; Konečni, 2012; Martindale, 2007a; Silvia, 2012). This will afford us greater opportunity to discuss the relevance of historically influential ideas to modern thinking. Prior to embarking on a historical analysis of major trends and their subsequent effects on contemporary empirical aesthetics, a few points must be clarified. The first point involves the interplay between science of aesthetics and science of art (see Brown and Dissanayake, 2009; Bullot and Reber, 2013). It has been pointed out correctly that these concepts are dissociable, although they clearly overlap in research and practice. It would not be too much of a stretch to argue that any science of art will be incomplete without including an explanation of the aesthetic components of how a viewer interacts with artworks as well as how a creator communicates information to the viewer. Similarly, although aesthetic interactions with non-art stimuli are commonplace, any comprehensive science of aesthetics would be incomplete if it were to lack an explanation of the ways in which aesthetic processes mediate our interactions with artworks. Explicitly highlighting the difference but also the interrelatedness of these two concepts is important because, as our historical overview will demonstrate, they have often been viewed in tandem. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,"Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Uniting the tribes of fluency to form a metacognitive nation (2009) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 13, pp. 219-235; Armstrong, T., Detweiler-Bedell, B., Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world (2009) Review of General Psychology, 12, pp. 305-329; Arnheim, R., (1954) Art and Visual Perception, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Bachmann, T., Vipper, K., Perceptual rating of paintings from different artistic styles as a function of semantic differential scales and exposure time (1983) Archives of Psychology, 135, pp. 149-161; Barrett, L.F., Mesquita, B., Ochsner, K.N., Gross, J.J., The experience of emotion (2007) Annual Review of Psychology, 58, pp. 373-403; Beebe-Center, J.G., (1932) The Psychology Ofpleasantness and Unpleasantness, , New York: D. van Nostrand; Berlyne, D.E., (1971) Aesthetics and Psychobiology, , CT: Appleton-Century-Crofts; Boselie, F., Against prototypicality as a central concept in aesthetics (1991) Empirical Studies of the Arts, 9, pp. 65-73; Boselie, F., Prototypicality revisited: A rejoinder to hekkert and snelders (1996) Empirical Studies of the Arts, 14, pp. 99-104; Brighouse, G., A study of aesthetic apperception (1939) Psychological Monographs, 51, pp. 1-22; Brown, S., Dissanayake, E., The arts are more than aesthetics: Neuroaesthetics as narrow aesthetics (2009) Neuroaesthetics, pp. 43-58. , M.

Research objectives: The purpose of this inquiry was to explore nurses’ moral competence related to fostering hope in patients and their families within the context of aggressive technological care. A secondary purpose was to understand how this competence is shaped by the social–moral space of nurses’ work in order to capture how competencies may reflect an adaptation to a less than ideal work environment. Research design: A critical qualitative approach was used. Participants: Fifteen graduate nursing students from various practice areas participated. Ethical considerations: After receiving ethics approval from the university, signed informed consent was obtained from participants before they were interviewed. Findings: One overarching theme ‘Mediating the tension between providing false hope and destroying hope within biomedicine’ along with three subthemes, including ‘Reimagining hopeful possibilities’, ‘Exercising caution within the social–moral space of nursing’ and ‘Maintaining nurses’ own hope’, was identified, which represents specific aspects of this moral competency. Discussion: This competency represents a complex, nuanced and multi-layered set of skills in which nurses must be well attuned to the needs and emotions of their patients and families, have the foresight to imagine possible future hopes, be able to acknowledge death, have advanced interpersonal skills, maintain their own hope and ideally have the capacity to challenge those around them when the provision of aggressive care is a form of providing false hope. Conclusion: The articulation of moral competencies may support the development of nursing ethics curricula to prepare future nurses in a way that is sensitive to the characteristics of actual practice settings. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Competency; end of life; ethics; ethics education; feminist ethics; hope; nursing; technology","clinical competence; female; hope; human; medical ethics; nurse patient relationship; nursing education; nursing student; psychology; qualitative research; statistics and numerical data; terminal care; Clinical Competence; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Ethics, Nursing; Female; Hope; Humans; Nurse-Patient Relations; Qualitative Research; Students, Nursing; Terminal Care",,,,,"Gutierrez, K.M., Critical care nurses’ perceptions of and response to moral distress (2005) Dimens Crit Care Nurs, 24 (5), pp. 229-241; Kälvemark, S., Höglund, A.T., Hansson, M.G., Living with conflicts-ethical dilemmas and moral distress in the health care system (2004) Soc Sci Med, 58, pp. 1075-1084; Huffman, D.M., Rittenmeyer, L., How professional nurses working in hospital environments experience moral distress: a systematic review (2012) Crit Care Nurs Clin North Am, 24, pp. 91-100; Robichaux, C.M., Clark, A.P., Practice of expert critical care nurses in situations of prognostic conflict at the end of life (2006) Am J Crit Care, 15 (5), pp. 480-489; Varcoe, C., Pauly, B., Storch, J., Nurses’ perceptions of and responses to morally distressing situations (2012) Nurs Ethics, 19, pp. 488-500; Pavlish, C., Brown-Salzman, K., Jakel, P., Nurses’ responses to ethical challenges in oncology practice: an ethnographic study (2012) Clin J Oncol Nurs, 16 (6), pp. 592-600; Begley, A.M., Truth-telling, honesty and compassion: a virtue-based exploration of a dilemma in practice (2008) Int J Nurs Pract, 14 (5), pp. 336-341; Begley, A.M., Blackwood, B., Truth-telling versus hope: a dilemma in practice (2000) Int J Nurs Pract, 6 (1), pp. 26-31; Lipscomb, M., Maintaining patient hopefulness: a critique (2007) Nurs Inq, 14 (4), pp. 335-342; Pergert, P., Lützén, K., Balancing truth-telling in the preservation of hope: a relational ethics approach (2012) Nurs Ethics, 19 (1), pp. 21-29; Simpson, C., When hope makes us vulnerable: a discussion of patient-healthcare provider interactions in the context of hope (2004) Bioethics, 18 (5), pp. 428-447; Simpson, C., Hope and feminist care ethics: what is the connection?

This was initiated by the threat of al-Qaeda and has been driven further by the transnational threat of the Global Sala Jihad (GSJ) movement. For a supranational entity such as the European Union (EU), this threat does not form part of a supercial mind-set, as was concocted with Y2K. The bombings that took place against the rail networks in Madrid and London show the need for a high level of coordination and commitment against home-grown terrorists as they emerge from the previous hunting grounds of Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA or the Basque separatist movement) and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), respectively. The challenges faced by all countries with intricate transportations systems and infrastructure are indeed complex. Rail networks, like most modern means of transportation, involve large gatherings of peoples in conned spaces. The crossing of multiple borders incorporates different languages, technologies, and policies related to counterterrorism (CT) add to the issue. The EU has offered some foresight in enhancing the security of infrastructure with initiatives such as the European Program for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and the Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN) but, like many policies, intent does not mean capability. The following chapter elucidates the signicance of infrastructure not only as an important economic tool within society, but more specically, as a terrorist target. The reasons for this are varied and encompass social, economic, and political motives. This chapter focuses mainly on the TEN-R European High Speed Rail Network and the threat posed by GSJ; however, data and case studies from similar networks and terrorist organizations will be taken into account. This topic indeed constitutes a large body of data and analysis, but no attempt is made here to incorporate all of the evidence and data that are currently at our disposal. This chapter, therefore, is intended to be a compliment to existing research that has been instrumental in formulating a more comprehensive understanding of this particular aspect of violent terrorism and terrorist acts. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Hoffman, B., (2006) Inside Terrorism, , New York: Columbia University Press; Leiken, R.S., (2012) Europe’s Angry Muslims: The Revolt of The Second Generation, , New York: Oxford University Press; Rich, P.B., Duyysteyn, I., (2012) The Routledge Handbook of Insurgency and Counterinsurgency, , Abingdon: Routledge; Sageman, M., (2008) Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century, , Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press; Schmid, A.P., (2011) The Routledge Handbook of Terrorism Research, , Abingdon: Routledge; Alexander, Y., Carlton, D., Wilkinson, P., (1979) Terrorism: Theory and Practice, , Boulder: Westview; Balzacq, T., The policy tools of securitization: Information exchange, EU foreign and interior policies (2008) Journal of Common Market Studies, 46 (1), pp. 75-100; Brahimi, A., (2010) Jihad and Just War and the War on Terror, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Buesa, M., Valiño, A., Heijs, J., Baumert, T., Gómez, G., (2006) The Economic Cost of March 11: Measuring the Direct Economic Cost of the Terrorist Attack on March 11, 2004 in Madrid, , Working Paper No. 54.

These infrastructure networks are highly interdependent due to linkages between the networks. Often these infrastructures are managed independently of each other. Changes in one sector of the economy will affect other sectors through linkages between sectors of the economy and together reach a new equilibrium. Interdependence between infrastructures indicates that national objectives will not be achievable through strategies focussing on one sector at a time or one infrastructure at a time. Policy makers need a methodology to guide them through a series of interrelated policy and investment interventions over time to improve the national operating capabilities embedded in interdependent environmental, economic and social infrastructures. This paper presents an integrated decision support framework which allows policy and investment options related to the operating capabilities of the economy to be evaluated holistically in terms of three sustainability measures: welfare of the people, environment and economy. The approach in this paper is to present the results of a literature review of related frameworks and models and to present an integrated framework and model which is able to express the impact of policy and investment interventions in infrastructure networks in terms of the three sustainability measures. We conclude that the objective may be achieved through a decision support system (DSS) supported by hybrid model consisting of an integrative macro economy model and sector specific infrastructure model with sufficient technological explicitness to evaluate the impact of policy and investment interventions. This hybrid model should reflect the interdependence between infrastructures. The integrated decision support framework will enable policy makers to evaluate the trajectory of national operating capabilities over time with and without specific policy and investment interventions within the context of a hybrid model of the integrated economy that reflects the infrastructures of sectors of the economy. This paper is relevant to economic and social impact of technology, to national and regional technology policies and infrastructure, and supports the theme of technological planning, foresight and forecasting.

For achieving this goal, the role of integrated energy and urban mobility systems are explored as part of a city's strategy towards sustainability (2011-2020). For developing future scenarios, we used best practice foresight analysis methods, where the desirable future relates to European policy goals. In this research, we adapt the extended metabolism model of a city developed by Newman (1999) and the material and energy flow accounting by Sheerin (2002) to assess the future role of electric vehicles, renewable energy (RE) use for mobility needs and energy efficiency increases for households living in the city of Aveiro, a medium-sized city of 78,450 inhabitants in Portugal. The social costs of carbon related to alternative vehicle technologies (electric vehicles) are assessed, along with the integration of RE. Several energy sources were considered: hydric, wind, solar (thermic and photovoltaic) and solid waste (incineration and biogas). A Life-Cycle Assessment analysis was performed for this estimation, where a share of 56% of RE was assumed to be achieved until 2020. It was found that each battery electric vehicle and the use of RE has an external cost associated with climate change of 0.032 /1000 pkm in 2011 and 0.012 /1000 pkm in 2020. For the city of Aveiro, this represents an external cost of 7094 in terms of CO2 related emissions in 2020. If all conventional fuelled vehicles were replaced by electric bicycles, an energy reduction of 98.1% and an emission reduction of 3893 kg CO2eq per year (avoided CO2eq external costs of 5.96M) could be achieved. © 2015 WIT Press.","battery electric vehicles and electric bicycles; climate change costs; CO2 emissions; energy efficiency; European transport policy and planning; renewable energy; traffic calming measures.","Bicycles; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Costs; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Life cycle; Solar power generation; Sporting goods; Vehicles; Waste incineration; CO2 emissions; Electric bicycles; European transport policy; Renewable energies; Traffic calming measures; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy resource; environmental economics; life cycle analysis; renewable resource; sustainability; transportation planning; transportation policy; Aveiro [Portugal]; Portugal",,,,,"(2011) White Paper-roadmap to A Single European Transport Area-Towards A Competitive and Resource Efficient Transport System, , EC, Brussels; (2007) Green Paper-Towards A New Culture for Urban Mobility, , EC, Brussels; (2011) Energy 2020-A Strategy for Competitive, Sustainable and Secure Energy, , EC; Banister, D., The sustainable mobility paradigm (2008) Transport Policy, 15, pp. 73-80. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.10.005; (2012) IEA Key World Energy Statistics, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/data-00451-en, International Energy Agency: Paris; Newman, P.W.G., Sustainability and cities: Extending the metabolism model (1999) Landscape and Urban Planning, 44, pp. 219-226. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0169-2046(99)00009-2; Sheerin, C., UK material flow accounting (2002) Economic Trends, 583; Black, W.R., Socio-economic barriers to sustainable transport (2000) Journal of Transport Geography, 8, pp. 141-147. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0966-6923(99)00038-1; Farla, J., Analysis of Barriers in the transition toward sustainable mobility in Netherlands (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77, pp. 1260-1269. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore2011.03.014; Dijk, M., The emergence of an electric mobility trajectory (2013) Energy Policy, 52, pp. 135-145. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.04.024; Rees, W., Wackernagel, M., Urban ecological footprints: Why cities cannot be sustainable-And why they are a key to sustainability (1996) Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 16, pp. 223-248. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0195-9255(96)00022-4; Roy, M., Planning for sustainable urbanisation in fast growing cities: Mitigation and adaptation issues addressed in Dhaka (2009) Bangladesh.

The model, representing a decentralized economy with utility-maximizing consumers and value-maximizing firms in a dynamic context, embodies both the spatial interactions among regions and the dynamics of regional investments. In this numerical simulation model, representing an inter-regional inter-sectoral economy, Japan is subdivided into 47 regions, all of which are connected by transportation networks. The model is calibrated for the regional economy in Japan. In the model, the world is subdivided into regions, throughout which are general industries, transportation industries and households. The economy is endowed with the primary factors of labor and capital. Labor is mobile across industries but not regions, and capital is immobile across industries and regions. Goods and factor prices are determined in perfectly competitive regional markets. The commodity trade between regions in a country generates demand for transportation services, and unit transportation costs are endogenous. Commodities are perfect substitutes (i.e., trade between regions is calculated by means of trade coefficients). The movement of commodities among regions is enabled by road, rail, sea and air transportation networks, and the modal share is stipulated. The model is solved for a rational expectation equilibrium with assumptions of perfect competition and foresight. However, we assume that firms place priority on the investment-savings balance, so the level of investment is determined by a firm’s optimizing behavior. In this paper, the economic impact of large-scale earthquakes is evaluated using our dynamic spatial CGE model. A steady-state solution is derived as a base case. Through numerical simulations, the economic impact of earthquakes in the Nankai Trough Region and Tokyo Metropolitan Area are assessed using hypothetical scenarios. Two cases (i.e., unpredicted and predicted occurrences) are assumed, and the respective solutions, characterized as non-steady state, are compared with the base case. We estimated the dynamic and spatial impacts, that is, the industrial investments and commodity flow between regions before and after the earthquakes. The results confirmed the importance of investments aimed at protecting the regional economy in the event of an earthquake disaster. © 2015 Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.

Drastic changes happened in the last forty yes - The imported oil has been replaced by a mix of coal and natural gas, energy efficiency and conservation have been improved by extensive use of CHP-based district heating and heat saving measures. In the same period Denmk became well-known by integration and export of wind turbines. In line with the changes in the past, Denmk currently has very ambitious renewable energy tgets, most ambitious being the 100 % renewable energy system in 2050. To achieve this, it is obvious that the present energy system needs to change, but the open question is how this should be done. In order to answer this question, the present paper uses TIMES-DTU model. TIMES-DTU is technology-rich, bottom-up, optimisation model covering all sectors of the Danish energy system, assuming full foresight and perfect competition. It simultaneously optimises investments and operation across all sectors and all time periods. Three different scenios have been described in the present paper: (i) Base scenio without any policy constraints imposed on the model, (ii) WLP with the constraint that 50 % of electricity production should come from wind stting from 2020, and (iii) WLP-NFE scenio with the constraint that power and heat sector should be fossil fuel-free stting from 2035 and Denmk should be 100 % renewable stting from 2050. In all scenios, Denmk was constrained to be a net exporter of electricity. The results imply that heat demand in future Danish energy system will be significantly reduced as a result of significant heat saving measures within the building stock, especially in rural and sub-urban eas. In urban eas, lge district heating networks will supply between 55 and 73 % of heat supply in the yes close to 2050. Electricity demand will be lgely increased mainly due to transition to lge scale heat pumps in the district heating networks. More than 90 % of increased demand for electricity will be based on on-shore and off-shore wind energy. WLP scenio implies less than 1 % higher total system costs comped to Base scenio, while WLP-NFE scenio implies 5-6 % higher total system costs comped to Base scenio. An additional conclusion from the current study is that Denmk has sufficient resources to achieve self-sufficiency in energy supply.","Energy conservation; Energy system modelling; Energy system planning;

In villages ethnic people, including Magar and Majhi highly depend on medicinal plants for their primary healthcare. Due to overexploitation, encroachment in forest for arable land and destruction of natural habitat, potentially useful medicinal plants are going to be threatened in their natural environment. There is a strong need to enlist highly valuable medicinal plants and use traditional knowledge to protect, utilize and manage them in ex-situ and in-situ conservation. The present research investigates and documents traditional knowledge on medicinal plants utilization as natural medicine by two ethnic communities Magar and Majhi of Parbat district in Western Nepal. Methods Ethnomedicinal data was collected during 2012-2013 by the following standard ethnobotanical methods. Data about medicinal uses of herbs, shrubs and trees were collected using semi-structured questionnaire, field observation, personal interview and group discussion with 334 (130 men and 204 women) pre-identified local informants, among which 13 male and 2 female were local healers. Statistical tool, informant consensus factors (FIC) and fidelity level (FL) values were used to analyze the importance of ethnomedicinal plants. Results A total of 132 ethnomedicinal plant species belonging to 99 genera and 67 families have been documented. These plants are used to treat various diseases and disorders grouped under 12 disease categories, with the highest number of species (61) being used for gastro-intestinal, parasitic and hepatobiliary disorders (FIC=0.78%), followed by blood and lymphatic system (FIC=0.76%) category. The highest fidelity level (FL) values recorded in Paris polyphylla (FL=96.0%) followed by Bergenia ciliata (FL=95.0%) confirms that these plants are the best plant species with medicinal properties. Conclusions The two ethnic communities, Magar and Majhi, in Parbat district are rich in ethnomedicinal knowledge. The high degree of consensus among the informants suggests that current use and knowledge are still strong, and thus the preservation of indigenous knowledge would show good foresight in acting before much has been lost. © 2015 The Authors.

The professional profiles presented were not aimed to reflect future careers, jobs, or even the creation of new academic courses, but consist of complementary technical skills that future professionals need to have in order to monitor activities that do not exist yet in a well-developed form, and that are identified as required by society on the proposed timeframe for reflection, 20 years. To conduct the study three methodological steps were adopted: (i) bibliographic review for the sector trends; (ii) panel with 24 experts for the validation of the proposed profiles; and (iii) interviews with 46 professionals to further detail of each profile identified. The details of each identified professional profile can be analyzed in the final publication of the search (Souza et al., 2014), in other words, the results of the proposed analysis can be audited. The 198 trends related to the profiles, these were grouped into three: (i) technological; (ii) social; and (iii) socio-technical, wherein technological and socio-technical represented over 85% of the frequency which strengthens the power of transformation that ICTs currently have and will have in the future. Thus, the relevance of technological evolution poses a greater importance in the transformation of society than otherwise. The 199 technical skills were categorized into 12 groups, wherein the first four in the ranking of frequency were: (i) interactivity; (ii) project management; (iii) analytical techniques; and (iv) interdisciplinarity. The frequency of knowledge for user interactivity with technology demonstrates a concern for disseminating technologies among users, and how these same users also transform the technology itself with the interaction process. It might be conjectured with this finding that the ICTs sector is an extremely market-oriented industry, because they have as first concern the knowledge related to usability and understandability by their customers (users) for the different delivered and developed products. Regarding to the functions to be performed, they were grouped into four categories: (i) research and development; (ii) operational; (iii) strategic; and (iv) technological prospecting, wherein and functions related to research and development were the most frequent, reflecting only what the sector itself represents, the research and development of new technologies. However it also represents a desire for change, in other words, the development of national technologies in the industry for different purposes, and the end of the current model of technological dependence that is in the Brazilian scenario.

It is also the portion of the planet that is perhaps in greatest need of data to address issues of the dramatic changes that are happening globally. Some of the changes are clearly the result of human inaction and lack of foresight. Fisheries, on which one sixth of human protein nutrition is derived, are in a state of near collapse for some species in the near term, owing to overfishing and mismanagement of a sustainable infrastructure. Lack of cautious application of new technologies and oversight has led to increasing levels of pollutants, sometimes catastrophically, as was evidenced in the recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Global warming is influencing many aspects of the ocean system and will have collateral impacts beyond simply raising the temperature of the planet. Navigation and influence on transport are chief in our envisioning eventual impacts, and need to be anticipated, based on the best of models and data. Sea level rise and the associated coastal erosion, modifying waterways and ports, call for adaptive planning. Climate change could easily be seen to affect ocean circulation, wind dynamics, storm production and associated storm surges. Loss of sea ice in the Arctic will open new avenues which are economically and energetically more efficient for transport. With warming, and heightened destruction of ice sheets will likely come increased hazards from sea ice in shipping lanes. The rate of loss of the ice sheets such as that of Greenland is only beginning to be understood, and appears to be increasing. Sea ice coverage in the Arctic was the lowest on record in the summer of 2012, and the area of surface melt on the Greenland Ice Sheet was recorded at the highest, at 97%, since satellite images have documented its status. Diminishing ice cover will also influence an increase of fishing efforts and exploration for fossil fuels in the high Arctic. Without precise data on the sizes of fish stocks, the effects on commercial fisheries are complex, and beg for fundamental knowledge. Additionally, with the loss of sea ice, diminishing ice-based productivity may lead to a loss of diversity and modification of sustainable trophic structure in Arctic food webs. As a consequence of increased fossil fuel exploration, extraction and transport, the risk of contamination is heightened and at present only minimal preparation for impact and cleanup exists for this eventuality in fragile Arctic environments. The addition of massive amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and oceans, has changed the ocean chemistry, increasing the acidity or lowering the pH. Sound propagation in a more acid ocean may affect navigation as well as migration patterns of marine mammals and fish. Acidification influence on calcareous organisms at primary production levels could lead to catastrophic effects on the higher organisms of the food chains. The collateral impacts of the changing ocean in a period of global warming urgently require further study in order to enable adaptation and reduce vulnerability. Only through an appreciation for the past and a comprehensive understanding of the present, can we anticipate the future. The potential for that vision of the ocean lies with the cooperation among all nations. Copyright © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Six urban logistic prototypes built on the themes of future cities, community resilience and urban supply chain management (SCM) are summarized, together with details of the data collection procedure and the methodological challenges encountered. Our investigation aimed to explore the potential of logistics prototyping to develop “user-driven” and “SME” approaches to future city design and urban supply chain decision-making. Design/methodology/approach – This Boston field experiment was a case study investigation conducted between May and August 2013. Qualitative data was collected using a “mixed-method” approach combining together focus groups (MIT faculty), scenarios, prototyping workshops, interviews and document analysis. These story-creators could use the prototype method as a way of testing their hypotheses, theories and constrained speculations with regard to specified future city and urban supply chain scenarios. Findings – This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of the SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be “tested” in the same manner. Research limitations/implications – By embedding logistics prototyping within a mixed method approach, we might be criticized as constraining its capability to map out the future – that its potential to be flexible and imaginative are held back by the equal weighting given to the more conventional component. In basing our case study within one city then this might be seen as limiting the complexity of the empirical context – however, the situation within different cities is inherently complex. Case studies also attract criticism on the grounds of not being representative; in this situation, they might be criticized as imperfect indicators of what transpires in other situations. However, this technical viewpoint suggests that in spite of its limitations, prototyping facilitates an imaginative and creative approach to theory generation and concept building. Practical implications – The methodology allows everyday citizens and SME’s to develop user-driven foresight and planning scenarios with city strategists’ and urban logistic designers. It facilitates much broader stakeholder involvement in city and urban supply chain policymaking, than current “quantitative” approaches. Social implications – Logistics fiction prototyping provides a democratic approach to future city planning and urban supply chain design. It involves collectively imagining socio-technical futures and second-order sociological effects through the writing of SF narratives or building “design fictions”. Originality/value – Decision-making in future cities and urban SCM is often a notable challenge, balancing the varying needs and claims of multiple stakeholders, while negotiating an acceptable trade-off between their competing claims. Engagement with stakeholders and active encouragement of stakeholder participation in the supply chain aspects of future cities is increasingly a feature of twenty-first century social decision-making. This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and the urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be “tested” in the same manner. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Green supply chains; Innovation; Logistics; Operations planning; Operations strategy; Sustainability",,,,,,"Blish, J., (1962) Cities in Flight, , Orion Publishing Group, London; Caplice, C., Blanco, E., (2006) Freight Transportation Infrastructure Survey: Causes and Solutions to the Current Capacity Crisis, , MIT Centre for Transportation and Logistics (CTL) Working Paper Series, Cambridge, MA; Caplice, C., Phadnis, S., (2013) Scenario Planning for Freight Transportation Infrastructure Investment, 1. , NCHRP Report 750, Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC; Clarke, A.C., (1956) City and the Stars, , Orion, London; Coates, J., Durance, P., Godet, M., Strategic foresight issues: Introduction (2010) Technology Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1423-1425; Deeming, H., Clarifying resilience (2013) Natural Hazards Observer, 37 (1), pp. 14-16; Dynes, R.R., Finding order in disorder: Continuities in the 9-11 response (2003) International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, 21 (3), pp. 9-23; Emerge, (2013) SFP: A Preliminary Assessment, , http://wealoneonearth.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/science-fiction-prototyping-preliminary.html, accessed 21 May 2013; Graham, G., Mehmood, R., The strategic prototype ‘crime-sourcing’ and the science/science fiction behind it (2014) Technology Forecasting and Social Change, 84, pp. 86-93; Johnson, B.D., Science Fiction Prototyping: Designing the Future with SF.

A review of the recent research in agriculture vehicle automatic guidance is presented in this paper, focusing on the position measurement, agriculture models and path tracking. And some forecasts are made on the trends of the agriculture vehicle automatic guidance. Generally, a modern agriculture vehicle automatic guidance system consists of 4 units: A detecting unit that measures the position and orientation of the vehicle; a control unit, as the core of the guidance system, which makes the plan of the path and carries out the path tracking; an executing unit that makes the turn of the wheels according to the command of the control unit; and a monitoring unit, or a field computer as it is called generally, which works as the interface between human and machine. There are 2 main problems to be solved in the agriculture vehicle guidance system. The first one is the measurement of the agriculture vehicle's working conditions, such as its position, heading, speed and wheel angle, among which the most important is the position measurement. There are 2 kinds of position measurement methods: One is the relative method, such as measuring the vehicle's position relative to a guidance baseline based on machine vision; the other is the absolute method, such as measuring the vehicle's absolute position on the earth based on the Global Navigation Satellite System. As the agriculture vehicle automatic guidance system is working in the field, the complicated and non-structured environment makes none of the measurement methods working well all the time. So the multi-sensor data fusion is brought into sharp focus by researchers. By combining measuring data from different sensors with some data fusing methods, such as Kalman filter, particle filter, H<inf>∞</inf> filter, and intelligent methods, the measurement accuracy is improved. The integrated navigation systems are mainly GPS/INS, GPS/DR and INS/CNS. The second problem is agriculture modeling and path tracking control methods. Most of the path tracking control algorithms use kinematics models. The two-wheel model is the most frequently used model, in which an agriculture vehicle is regarded as a two-wheel vehicle and its pose is described by its geographical coordinates, heading, wheel angle and speed. Dynamics models based on the Newton second law are another kind of model commonly used. As it takes into account of the change of the vehicle's dynamic characteristics with the external environment and the farm implements, it makes the control algorithms more robust. Besides the control methods based on models, researchers have developed some kind of algorithm without a model. The PID is the most useful control strategy. Another one is the pure pursuit method which simulates the driving behavior of human and has foresight. Nowadays, the agriculture vehicle automatic navigation technologies have widely used in the agriculture production, but many problems still need to be studied further. The advanced navigation technologies are worth studying, such as the headland turning control, obstacle detecting and active collision avoidance, and cooperative navigation by multi vehicles. And the agriculture vehicle internet of things is another interesting research area. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.
