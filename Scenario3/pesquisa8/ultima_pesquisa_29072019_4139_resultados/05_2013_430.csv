This has partly been attributed to the differing local contexts and organisational cultures in the public services departments (even within the same government). Because of this scenario, there is need to review the different technology design endeavours geared towards achieving process automation and application integration in the different government departments to achieve meaningful and robust e-Government development. This lead chapter intends to review the different approaches that have been done on the technology front of e-Government (especially design of interoperability frameworks and ontology platforms) in different parts of the world and outlines the future works that e-Government researchers and practitioners need to concentrate on. This chapter sets the tone for the remaining chapters of this book, which discuss various aspects of e-Government implementation from the technological front (deployment, design, and customization of e-Government solutions). The chapter posits that with the current pace of technological advancements and efforts by the OASIS forum and other interested parties, it is not difficult to notice that global technological models of e-Government are to be realized in the foreseeable future. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Al-Khouri, A.M., e-Government in Arab countries: A 6-staged roadmap to develop the public sector (2013) Journal of Management and Strategy, 4 (1), pp. 80-107; Baldoni, B., Fuligni, S., Mecella, M., Tortorelli, F., The Italian e-government service oriented architecture: Strategic vision and technical solutions (2009) Electronic.

To capture its various facets, formalized studies of such external information gathering have gone through an evolution over time. Simplifying the concept to its core value of 'External Technology Search' (ETS), we have found that many researchers have tackled this work under different headings including technology intelligence[1][2][3], technology foresight[4], technology scouting[1][5][6], and technical intelligence[7], [8]. We use the term ETS as the umbrella term to cover these multiple terms in the literatures with the goal of providing a better cohesive view of this field for the practitioners. In this brief literature review, the evolution of this area has been documented. ETS needs to be defined and implemented more systematically in organization so that ETS can more effectively drive the positive progress need. In spite of some good efforts by researchers so far, ETS remains in the early stages of maturity under both academic standards and industry applications. © 2013 PICMET.",,"Academic standards; External informations; Industry applications; Literature reviews; Technology change; Technology foresight; Technology intelligence; Technology scouting; Industrial applications; Technology",,,,,"Brenner, M.S., Technology intelligence and technology scouting (1996) Comepetitiv Intelligence Review, 7 (3), pp. 20-27; Savioz, P., Technology intelligence systems: Practices and models for large, medium-sized and start-up companies (2006) International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning, 2 (4), p. 360; Lichtenthaler, E., Third generation management of technology intelligence processes (2003) R and D Management, 33 (4), pp. 361-375. , Sep; Reger, G., Technology foresight in companies: From an indicator to a network and process perspective (2001) Technology Analysis &Strategic Management, 13 (4); Rohrbeck, R., Technology scouting-A case study on the deutsche telekom laboratories (2007) ISPIM-Asia Conference, pp. 1-14. , January; Bodelle, C., Jablon, J., Science and technology scouting at elf aquitaine (1993) RESEARCH TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT, 36 (5), p. 24; Ashton, R.A., Bradford, W., (1997) Klavans, Keeping Abreast of Science and Technology, , Battlle Press; Ashton, W., Stacey, G., Technical intelligence in business: Understanding technology threats and opportunities (1995) International Journal of Technology Management, 10 (1), pp. 79-104; Khormaei, R., Capability life cycle tool to integrate external innovation (2011) PICMET; Harjivan, M., Deck, C., Treasure hunt: Scouting out the right technologies to develop breakthrough products cost effectively (2007) PRTM Insight, 30 (2); Methods, A., Group, W., Technology futures analysis: Toward integration of the field and new methods (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (3), pp. 287-303; Nosella, A., Petroni, G., Salandra, R., Technological change and technology monitoring process: Evidence from four italian case studies (2008) Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 25 (4), pp. 321-337. , Dec; Rohrbeck, R., Technology scouting-A case study on the deutsche telekom laboratories (2007) ISPIM-Asia Conference, pp. 1-14. , January; Brenner, M.S., Technology intelligence and technology scouting (1996) Comepetitiv Intelligence Review, 7 (3), pp. 20-27; Rohrbeck, R., Bade, M., Environmental scanning, futures research, strategic foresight and organizational future orientation: A review, integration, and future research directions (2012) ISPIM Annual Conference, pp. 1-14; Anderson, J., Technology foresight for competitive advantage (1997) Long Range Planning, 30 (5), pp. 665-677; Reger, G., Technology foresight in companies: From an indicator to a network and process perspective (2001) Technology Analysis &Strategic Management, 13 (4); Lichtenthaler, E., Third generation management of technology intelligence processes (2003) R and D Management, 33 (4), pp. 361-375. , Sep; Rohrbeck, R., Harnessing a network of experts for competitive advantage: Technology scouting in the ICT industry (2010) R&d Management, pp. 169-180; Daim, T.U., Kocaoglu, D.F., Anderson, T.R., Using technological intelligence for strategic decision making in high technology environments (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (2), pp. 197-198. , Feb","Portland State University, Engineering and Technology Management Dept., Portland, OR, United States",,,,"2013 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, PICMET 2013","28 July 2013 through 1 August 2013","San Jose, CA",101418,,9781890843274,,,"English","Proc.

A common problem when designing standards for education is that a top-down approach is used by the learning technologists that often doesn't take into account recent developments coming from research or the actual practice. This paper examines a particular methodology, processes and tools used for developing a roadmap for the standards community (CEN WS-LT) with application on competency-driven education. A series of models and activities were developed to describe how community requirements are fed into the specification design process and valorized in the standards consensus process. Our roadmapping methodology made extensive use of foresight analysis methods, including visioning, futuring, and gap analysis. In addition, we have used semantic modeling tools for capturing and extending the knowledge and modeling activities of the target group communities. A Special Interest Group was created under the CEN WS-LT workshop umbrella in order to facilitate disagreement management and modeling activities among the groups working in the field. The created roadmap served as a tool for collaborative strategic planning for the involved community. © 2013 PICMET.",,"Analysis method; Design process; Designing standards; Gap analysis; Management methodologies; Semantic Model; Special interest groups; Top-down approach; Semantics; Tools; Standardization",,,,,"Barre, R., Synthesis of technology foresight (2001) Strategic Policy Intelligence: Current Trends, the State of Play and Perspectives, , Tubke et al., Seville: IPTS; European parliament and council (2008) Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on the Establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (2008/C 111/01); Eerola, A., Joergensen, B.H., Technology foresight in europe and other regions of the world: The efmn annual mapping report 2006 (2002) Report to the European Commission, Delf: TNO; Engeström, Y., Expansive learning at work: Toward an activity theoretical reconceptualization (2001) Journal of Education &Work, 14 (1), pp. 133-156; Engeström, Y., Expansive visibilization of work: An activitytheoretical perspective (1999) Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 8 (1-2), pp. 63-93; Engeström, Y., (1987) Learning by Expanding: An Activity-theoretical Approach to Developmental Research, , Helsinki: Orienta-Konsultit; Hoel, T., Kamtsiou, V., ICOPER Big Picture-modelling the central concepts of competency-driven learning (2009) ICALT Conference, 1st European Workshop on ICOPER Best Practice on Standards for Learning Education and Training, , Riga July 15, Best workshop award in ICALT; Kamtsiou, V., Naeve, A., Stergioulas, L., Koskinen, T., Roadmapping as a knowledge creation process: The prolearn roadmap (2007) Journal of Universal Knowledge Management, 13 (3), pp. 163-173; Koenig, R., (1999) Science, 285, pp. 174-175. , 5425; Naeve, A., Yli-Luoma, P., Kravcik, M., Lytras, M., Simon, B., Lindegren, M., Nilsson, M., Kieslinger, B., A conceptual modelling approach to studying the learning process-with a special focus on knowledge creation (2005) Deliverable 5.3 of the PROLEARN EU/FP6 Network of Excellence, IST 507310, , June; Naeve, A., Disagreement management as a way to increase the organizational performance of Humanity Inc (2009) Invited Talk at the TENcompetence Winter School in Innsbruck, , http://www.slideshare.net/EagleBear/ambjrn-on-disagreementmanagment-9882 33, February 2, 2009; Naeve, A., Palmér, M., Ebner, H.H., Disagreement Management, , in press; Naumanen, M., (2001) Roadmap-Kartta Menestykseen, , in MET-julkaisuja nro 23/2001, Finland; Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., Konno, N., SEci, ba and leadership: A unified model of dynamic knowledge creation (2000) Long Range Planning, 33. , Elsevier Science Ltd; Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., The knowledge-creating theory revisited: Knowledge creation as a synthesizing process (2003) Knowledge Management Research &Practice, 1 (1), pp. 2-10; Phaal, R., Farrukh, C., Probert, D., Customizing roadmapping (2004) Research Technology Management, Industrial Research Institute, Inc. 1, 47 (2), pp. 26-37. , 12; Phaal, R., Farruk, C., Probert, D., (2010) Roadmapping for Strategy and Innovation: Aligning Technology and Markets in A Dynamic World, p. 13. , Centre for Technology Management, Institute for Manufacturing, University Cambridge, ISBBN 978-1-902546-82-7; Radnor, M., Corporate technology and product roadmapping: Comparing hopes and realities (1998) Paper Presented at the Technology Roadmap Workshop, , Washington DC: Office of Naval Research, October 29; Truex, D.P., Baskerville, R., Klein, H.K., Growing systems in an emergent organization (1999) Communications of the ACM, 42 (8), pp. 117-123","Brunel University, London, United Kingdom",,,,"2013 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, PICMET 2013","28 July 2013 through 1 August 2013","San Jose, CA",101418,,9781890843274,,,"English","Proc.

The primary function of any local authority archive is managing council records but many such record offices also house significant collections of local historical and antiquarian interest. The primary aim of this research is to show how the people and events which precede the establishment of an official archive service can not only structure the collections but also influence decision makers and shape the very principles of that service. In the century before there was a Shetland Archives a handful of forward-looking, publicspirited Shetlanders took the matter of collecting, and storing records of local interest into their own hands. The attitudes, foresight and dedication of these men allowed the Shetland Archives, when it opened in the 1970s, to provide access to rich local historical collections in addition to its role as keeper of council records. It is the strong antiquarian interest in Shetland and the contribution a handful of prudent Shetlanders made, to what now constitutes the collections of the Shetland Archives, which will be the focus of this article. © 2013 Archives and Records Association.","Antiquarian; Archives; Scotland; Shetland",,,,,,"Anderson, P., The Evolution of Local Authority Archives 1960-1990 (1997) Scottish Local History Forum Journal, pp. 9-15. , 39 Spring; Ash, M., (1980) The Strange Death of Scottish History, , Edinburgh: Ramsay Head Press; Balfour, D., (1859) Oppressions of the Sixteenth Century in the Islands of Orkney and Zetland: From Original Documents, , ed., Edinburgh: Maitland Club; Bell, A.S., (1981) The Scottish Antiquarian Tradition.

The driving forces for the formation of the pillararene-based assemblies are discussed first. The host-guest interactions are deemed as not only general strategy for constructing assemblies but also essential components for preventing the assemblies from the dissociation. Solvent effect is also important in the assembling process, since it could influence the host-guest interactions and provide solvophobic effect on pillararenes for the assembly. Then, several pillararene-based assembly architectures are introduced, including pillararene-based interlocked structures, such as (poly)pseudorotaxanes, (poly)rotaxanes, and daisy chains, classified by their topological structures and synthetic strategy. The morphologies of the supramolecular assemblies are divided into several types, for example, nanospheres, nanotubes and supramolecular polymers. Furthermore, the functions and potential applications are summarized accompanied with related assembly structures. The review not only provides fundamental findings, but also foresights future research directions in the research area of pillararene-based assemblies. Supramolecular architectures: Recent advancements on pillararene-based assemblies by discussing the driving forces of the assembly formations, for example, host-guest interactions and solvent effects, as well as classifying various pillararene-based assembly architectures, for example, pillararene-based interlocked structures and topological supramolecular assemblies are described. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, little is known about Malaysia's foresight initiative. The foresight initiative conducted by Malaysia since its inception in 1997 until Malaysia's first technology foresight initiative at the national level in 2010 does not clearly show its position of its foresight initiative. The details of it and the way it is utilized are unknown at this point.

High-profile technology foresight activities, which have served as best practice models, describe possible future development scenarios or trajectories on the cutting edge of science and technology. Such a 'grand narratives' approach, while appropriate for advanced industrialised economies, is not suitable for small catching-up economies that should opt, instead, for an 'intelligent piggybacking' approach to foresight. This approach focuses on mapping global development trajectories and finding the possibilities for restructuring and upgrading existing technological and production capabilities. Recent foresight experiences in Estonia are discussed in light of the model proposed.

In this study, based on the experience in the pilot projects for technology foresight implemented by the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (Japan) in 2007 and 2008, we applied multiple foresight methods, including the Delphi method, in an attempt to design a new technology foresight method oriented toward vision creation on ageing society in Japan. As a result, we could develop a final vision in a clearer form by applying multiple methods and reflecting the survey results obtained by each method. The process of preparing for the Delphi survey is also suggested to be effective in promoting the formation of a consensus among experts of different fields, which also works well toward vision creation.

The heavy burden of uncertainties and emergence of interrupted and wild card events have changed the conditions in a way that future forecasting is not possible for planners. On the other hand, in regional and urban planning it is necessary to change the attitude from forecasting to foresight. Considering this, the paper attempts to introduce the approach of foresight as well as having a critical view of the current process of planning in foreseeing and future studies. Moreover, this study emphasizes the necessity of employing the foresight approach in the process of urban and regional studies.","Foresight; Planning process; Processes re-engineering","engineering; forecasting method; management practice; planning system; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis; urban planning",,,,,"The potential of regional foresight (2002) Final Report of the STRATA-ETAN Expert Group, European Research Area, , ERA; Faludi, A., The planning environment and the meaning of planning (1970) Regional Studies, 4 (1), pp. 1-9; (2001) A Practical Guide to Regional Foresight, , Foren, European Commision Research Directorate General, ESTRATA programme, December; Khazaee, S., (2007) Future Researching: Concepts and Needs, , http://www.ayandehpajoohi.com/archive/00126.php; Lingren, M., (2003) Scenario Planning: The Link between Future and Strategy, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Masumi-Ashkevari, H., (2008) Scientific Guidelines for Planning and Foresight, , Tehran: Payam Press; Mobini-Dehkordi, A., (2008) Mega Dimes as Strategic Need for Offices Futures, , Tehran: International Energy Institute; Myer, D., Kitsuse, A., Construction the future in planning: A survey of theories and tools (2000) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 19 (3), pp. 221-231; Nazemi, A., (2007) Zone Foresight as Land Preparation, , Tehran: Atinegar Idea Center; Nazemi-Ghadiri, A., (2006) Foresight from Concept to Running, , Tehran: New Industries Center; Porter, A..L., (1991) Forecasting and Management of Technology, , New York: Wiley; Schwartz, P., (2008) The Art of Future Vision, , transl.

Using document analysis and semi-structured interviews, this investigation of the forward-looking information produced by the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) shows how an organisation uses foresight to seek policy influence and anticipate nanotechnology's alternative futures. The set of approaches identified and investigated in this research include bringing the future into the present, regularly updating knowledge through repetition, capitalising on the first mover advantage, placing forward-looking information at the centre and periphery of analysis, and ensuring precise timing in the production of anticipatory knowledge. The findings demonstrate the social construction of plausibility and illustrate concrete strategies that can be successfully marshalled to strengthen plausible foresight for policy influence. These approaches also offer a replicable blueprint that organisations from all sectors can take to make foresight relevant and actionable for policy-makers.

Techniques to create interesting narratives, however, have been overlooked in the peer-reviewed environmental foresight literature. We describe a participatory, multidimensional, pragmatic technique to generate qualitative foresight (""scenario"") narratives. We applied this technique in the Mekong region of Southeast Asia during 11 workshops conducted in 5 countries and 1 regional setting. To improve consideration of systemic connections, narratives were shared between the six settings, allowing participants to understanding cross-scale enablers and inhibitors of desired development outcomes. A second innovative feature is elaboration of character-oriented narratives. We discuss how the technique responds to ongoing methodological challenges of critical inquiry, policy salience, and agency. © 2013 by the author(s).","Asia; Mekong; Methodology; Narrative; Participation; Scenario","environmental management; environmental planning; participatory approach; Mekong River; Southeast Asia",,,,,"Alcamo, J., (2001) Scenarios as tools for international environmental assessments., , http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental_issue_report_2001_24, Environment Issue Report No 24.

We consider three nuclear cost events and four carbon emissions caps. We develop a two-stage framework for energy-economic model MARKAL to eliminate foresight of future nuclear cost movements. We examine how the EGTM responds to these movements under alternative caps and analyze how these movements affect the cost of each cap. We define the expected savings from perfect foresight (ESPF), an upper bound on the VOI. We found that with current technologies, carbon mitigation that does not rely heavily on nuclear electricity is economically insensible. The Strong Cap is extremely costly because it restricts flexibility to respond to cost signals in choosing among technologies. The ESPF is highest under the Medium Cap by a substantial margin.","Foresight; MARKAL; Nuclear electricity; Value of information",,,,,,"(2009) American Clean Energy and Security Act, , H.R. 2454, 111th Cong; Babiker, M., Gurgel, A., Paltsev, S., Reilly, J., Forward-looking versus recursive-dynamic modeling in climate policy analysis: A comparison (2009) Economic Modeling, 26, pp. 1341-1354; Baker, E., Peng, Y., The Value of Better Information on Technology R&D Programs in Response to Climate Change (2012) Environmental Modeling and Assessment, 17, pp. 107-121; Bosetti, V., Tavoni, M., Uncertain R&D, backstop technology, and GHGs stabilization (2009) Energy Economics, 31, pp. S18-S26; Clarke, L.E., Weyant, J.P., (2002) Modeling induced technical change: An overview, , in Grubler, A., Nakicenovic, N., Nordhaus, W.D.

Adopting a case-based approach, three software companies engaged in four new product development projects served as our empirical research sites. With emphasis placed on their innovation teams' everyday practices, data for the empirical inquiry were collected using the qualitative methods of semistructured interviews, ethnographical observation and project archival documents. Explicating the observed foresightful practices and their underlying activities under the general rubrics of organizing architecture and social co-ordination, we identified over-compartmentalization, over-determinism and (in)congruence-of-values as quintessentially embedded organizing practices, that constitutively enable (or impede) organizational foresightfulness.

A number of factors may facilitate the realisation of this potential, in particular community engagement activities that build community resilience and capacity to adapt to changing environments. This paper reviews a community foresight initiative, named Clermont Preferred Future (CPF), which is associated with a coal mine development in the town of Clermont in Queensland, Australia. The purpose of CPF, which was adopted in 2008 and is intended to continue to 2020, is to facilitate a transition to a prosperous and sustainable future by leveraging opportunities from coal mining while reducing dependence on the industry. CPF has been cited as a successful model of engagement and community development, and was highly commended in the Community Economic Development category at the 2011 Australian National Awards for Economic Development Excellence. This review draws on the experiences of stakeholders involved in CPF, and on foresight, community engagement, and community development literature. It identifies what has worked well, what has fallen short of the project's rhetorical aspirations, and how processes and outcomes might be improved. It also trials artwork as an engagement tool. The findings are valuable for Clermont specifically, but also for the mining industry and mining communities more broadly, as well as for other industries in the context of community engagement and strategic planning. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Art engagement; Community development; Community engagement; Foresight; Futures studies; Mining; Visioning",,,,,,"Miles, B., Reark, J., Kinnear, S., Howkins, T., Springer, T., Responding to the challenges of regional development: Clermont's Preferred Future and community development strategy (2008) Proceedings of the 12th SEGRA (Sustainable Economic Growth for Regional Australia) Conference, , Albury, Australia, 18-20 August; Faint, S., Hamblin, N., The future is rosy, but it hasn't always been this way.

These possible areas of competitive advantage can exist in the periphery of the firm's strategic vision and can get easily blurred as a result of rigidness and can permeate in the decision-making process of the firm. This article explores how electric utility firms with a renewable energy portfolio can become strategically rigid in terms of adoption of newer technologies. The reluctance or delay in the adoption of new technology can be characterized as strategic rigidness, brought upon as a result of a firm's core competence or core capability in the other, more conventional technology arrangement. This paper explores the implications of such rigidness on the performance of a firm and consequently on the energy eco-system. The paper substantiates the results by emphasizing the case of Iberdrola S.A., an incumbent firm as a wind energy developer and its adoption decision behavior. We illustrate that the very routines that create competitive advantage for firms in the electric utility industry are vulnerable as they might also develop as sources of competitive disadvantage, when firms confront environmental change and uncertainty. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Peripheral vision; Strategic foresight; Technology adoption","Competitive advantage; Decision making process; Electric utility industry; Environmental change; Integrative capabilities; Peripheral vision; Strategic foresight; Technology adoption; Competition; Electric utilities; Rigidity; Wind power; Industry; alternative energy; decision making; electricity industry; renewable resource; strategic approach; technology adoption; wind power",,,,,"Amabile, T.M., A model of creativity and innovation in organizations (1988) Research in Organizational Behavior, 10, pp. 123-167; Barney, J.B., Resource-based theories of competitive advantage: a ten-year retrospective on the resource-based view (2001) Journal of Management, 27, pp. 643-650; Bansal, P., Responsible strategic decision making (2005), Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual Meeting of the International Association for Business and Society, Sonoma Valley, California, USA; http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBE:SM/profile, Bloomberg.

We present findings from an international foresight project which analyses and discusses the emergence and diffusion of new innovation patterns and their consequences for innovation policy. Based on a collection of international practice examples from industry and society, innovation visions have been generated and assessed involving different experts from all over Europe. A generic trend identified can be best described as open, distributed and networked innovation process which is to a certain extent already addressed in current innovation policy making. However, other trends such as the increased use of information technologies or new spatial shifts related to organising and doing innovation have rather been underestimated so far and will require new policy responses in the future.

A debate has emerged about whether the nuclear nonproliferation regime is sufficient to contain nuclear proliferation. Nuclear proliferation regime has confronted new challenges in recent times. Developments stemming from the demise of the former USSR have raised few serious problems: a previously acknowledged nuclear weapon state had been subjected to political disintegration. This was a period of nuclear transformation which required long-term cooperation between Russia and the United States. This period of transition was facilitated by the foresight of policymakers from both sides of the former cold war divide and by the frameworks of arms control and disarmament agreements then in place. Ensuring nuclear stability during this period was possible because of agreements like the NPT and START.

Using a Southern France case study, we describe four scenarios, debated with farmers and stakeholders during workshops and evaluated in terms of total water demand. Results suggest that socio-economic evolution could lead to a 40% increase of irrigation water demand. From a methodological perspective, the research highlights the mutual benefits for both policy makers and scientists of involving stakeholders in the development of scenarios, using both qualitative storylines and quantitative modeling tools. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Foresight; France; Global change; Planning; Uncertainty","Agricultural water; Crop water requirements; Foresight; France; Global change; Irrigation waters; Quantitative modeling; Uncertainty; Irrigation; Planning; Water supply; Research; irrigation system; methodology; numerical model; policy making; quantitative analysis; socioeconomic survey; stakeholder; water demand; water management; France",,,,,"Alcamo, J., The SAS approach: combining qualitative and quantitative knowledge in environmental scenarios (2008) Environmental Futures: the Practice of Environmental Scenario Analysis, pp. 123-150. , Elsevier, Amsterdam, J.

Professor A.D. de Groot, internationally well-known by his research on Thought and choice in chess, analysed the success rate figures provided by Statistics Netherlands. Based on the differences in success rates between students with different profiles in pre-university education, between genders and between students from different social-economic backgrounds, he formulated some concerns in the case much more students should enrol in universities, such as lower success rates and longer time to degree. He warned to exercise restraint in selecting students based on group statistics of successful characteristics. Since this article was published, universities are still struggling with the question how to raise the success rates. De Groot's concerns are still in the middle of all the discussions and policy in Dutch higher education, at the moment especially pointing at selection methods.

Plausibility is an under-theorised and illusive concept yet one that critically moves beyond a search for a factual encounter with the future. While not assuming that plausibility will unproblematically lift policy making and technology assessment from failures of both imagination and prediction, teasing apart the tensions latent in the concept is helpful and timely. The articles in this special issue ask: is plausibility another mode of relating to the future that acknowledges an intrinsically uncertain and contingent future? Does plausibility offer a pathway away from the pathologies of prediction and probabilistic thinking to create a more fruitful space to make better decisions? This introductory article describes the intellectual pursuit of plausibility through a description of the contemporary conditions that necessitate a revised approach to uncertainty and a historical account of the rise of probabilistic thinking.

Such quality criteria can be defined relative to the intended function of the knowledge. Plausibility has emerged as a central quality criterion of scenarios that allows exploring the future with credibility and saliency. But what exactly is plausibility vis-à-vis probability, consistency, and desirability? And how can plausibility be evaluated and constructed in scenarios? Sufficient plausibility, in this article, refers to scenarios that hold enough evidence to be considered 'occurrable'. This might have been the underlying idea of scenarios all along without being explicitly elaborated in a pragmatic concept or methodology. Here, we operationalise plausibility in scenarios through a set of plausibility indications and illustrate the proposal with scenarios constructed for Phoenix, Arizona. The article operationalises the concept of plausibility in scenarios to support scholars and practitioners alike.

Plausibility is generally considered an important criterion for high quality scenarios. Lately, the usefulness of anticipatory governance has come under attack. Some of this criticism is directed at the practice of framing normative reflection on emerging science and technology in terms of the 'future' they will eventually produce. Such 'future discourse' is claimed, among others, to maintain an a-historical conception of the future, to be lacking in imagination, to reify innovation processes and to ignore their contingency, and, ultimately, to share the hubris of technoscience. This paper investigates to what extent sociotechnical and techno-ethical scenario approaches are liable to this criticism of 'future talk', in particular as voiced by philosopher of technology Alfred Nordmann. In addition, it questions whether the aim to develop plausible scenarios increases or decreases such liability.

This concept of morphogenesis and the concept of embryo pattern formation based on chemical diffusion patterns were corroborated with the discovery of the Homeobox or Hox genes. In the following decades, Hox gene research has expanded and is now shown to underlie the variety of morphological novelties that we experience in nature, the patterning of structural aspects of different organs including the brain and also mutant animals that may in the future give rise to novel speciation. Turing had the foresight and vision and with his work created the field of computational biology and mathematical modeling in biological systems. In this paper, we will discuss the concept of Hox genes, their role in patterning the embryo, how it relates to Turing's concept of morphogenesis and what further insights they may provide. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.","Development; Hox genes; Morphogenesis; Morphological novelties","Chemical diffusion; Computational biology; Computational framework; Development; Hox gene; Morphogenesis; Morphological novelties; Structural aspects; Bioinformatics; Biological systems; Genes; Morphology",,,,,"Bao, A.M., Swaab, D.F., Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relation to gender identity, sexual orientation and neuropsychiatric disorders (2011) Front Neuroendocrinol, 32 (2), pp. 214-226; Carroll, S.B., Endless forms: the evolution of gene regulation and morphological diversity (2000) Cell, 101 (6), pp. 577-580; Carroll, S.B., Evo-devo and an expanding evolutionary synthesis: a genetic theory of morphological evolution (2008) Cell, 134, pp. 25-36; Carroll, S.B., Grenier, J., Weatherbee, S., (2004) From DNA to Diversity: Molecular Genetics and the Evolution of Animal Design, , NY: Wiley; Duboule, D., (1994) Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes, , Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press; Duboule, D., Dollé, P., The structural and functional organization of the murine HOX gene family resembles that of the Drosophila homeotic genes (1989) EMBO J, 8, pp. 1597-1605; Finnerty, J.R., Martindale, M.Q., The evolution of the Hox cluster: insights from outgroups (1998) Curr Opin Genet Dev, 8, pp. 681-687; Foronda, D., De Navas, L.F., Garaulet, D.L., Sánchez-Herrero, E., Function and specificity of Hox genes (2009) Int J Dev Biol, 53 (8-10), pp. 1404-1419. , doi:10.1387/Ijdb.072462df; Gehring, W.J., The homeo box: a key to the understanding of development?

Yet not only does this ignore the nature of national identity, which has been overlooked in the discussion of nationalist development on Cyprus, it also seems to credit the British with too much foresight and control. This article questions whether the development of a Turkish identity within the Muslim population was primarily based on British encouragement. It also argues that Turkish-Cypriot nationalism, rather than being 'late' or 'imposed', emerged similarly to other national identities. As the 1950-1951 attempt to appoint a mufti demonstrates, Turkish-Cypriot leadership appeared in spite of rather than because of the colonial administration. Indeed, the incident shows how British officials misunderstood the desires and concerns of the Turkish Cypriots just as much as they did Greek-Cypriot feelings regarding Enosis. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.",,,,,,,"Akçali, E., Getting Real on Fluctuating National Identities: Insights from Northern Cyprus (2011) Antipode, 43 (5), pp. 1725-1747; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London: Verso; Apeyitou, E., Turkish-Cypriot Nationalism: Its History and Development (1571-1960) (2003) Cyprus Review, 15 (1), pp. 67-98; Ateşin, H.M., The Process of Secularisation of the Turkish Community 1925-1975 (2006) Britain in Cyprus: Colonialism and Post-Colonialism, 1878-2006, pp. 327-342. , In, edited by H.

It explicitly highlights how a common future-oriented proactive attitude built-up in participative stakeholder communication networks can assist in shaping and creating a vision of a less uncertain and ambiguous future. First, the advancement of the disaster management concept and its various stages, including risk analysis, mitigation and response are explained. Forward-looking activities on short- and long-term temporal scales are introduced and put into a disaster risk management context. Recent developments in risk and crisis communication are discussed as evolving in a new environment that emphasizes network-centric communication shaped by the increasing influence of web 2.0 social media platforms. It is further described how future-oriented processes and inherent communication approaches can improve disaster risk management. Finally, the various time-scale-dependent future-oriented activities are conceptually integrated into a framework of risk governance. Active and participative communication is thereby seen as the key for successfully implementing risk governance and favor disaster mitigation and future risk reduction.","Foresight and strategic planning;

Olin College of Engineering (Olin) are establishing a student-centered hands-on interactive approach to engineering education (similar to Olin's) at UTEP, where it will reside in UTEP's innovative B.S. in Leadership Engineering (LE) program. The goal of the proposed collaboration is to catalyze UTEP's educational innovation through a cross-campus collaboration between the two institutions by incorporating the Olin educational process, both design and features, into the first offerings of the Bachelor of Science in Leadership Engineering (BSLE) program. Specifically, the collaboration includes faculty exchanges between the two institutions; a series of retreats for planning and assessment; curriculum development; and student recruitment practices. The 21st century workplace demands a new engineer - one who effectively contributes to solving problems using innovation, creativity, and strategic foresight. Graduates of the Olin-UTEP developed Bachelor of Science in Leadership Engineering (LE) program will possess these attributes through the program's rigorous yet flexible major in engineering, and in-depth study of leadership and its effect upon technology and society. In this panel we will share the context for our innovative approach, key features of the partnership to date, and acclaim the value of inter-institutional sharing. © 2013 IEEE.","Collaboration; Engineering education; Frameworks; Leadership Engineering; Olin; Partner; Student-centered; UTEP","Collaboration; Frameworks; Olin; Partner; Student-centered; UTEP; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Societies and institutions; Students",,,,,"(2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, p. 36. , National Academy of Engineering,.

The conversations took place between January and March of 2011. The marked increase starting in 2008 of prescriptive documents such as guidelines, codes of responsibility, and best practices in NanoEthicsBank offered an entry point for initiating the conversations. Had respondents noticed these documents and did they find them useful? Follow-up questions asked about the full life cycle of their products. The responses from 22 of the 25 organizations selected are categorized in 5 groups according to how they described their nano materials/business. A conception of responsible management in organizations is provided to underpin the analysis of the responses. This conception features virtues of concern, care, and foresight implied by a fundamental moral obligation. In the analysis, definitions from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) are used as a basis of comparison in assessing respondents' claims. Two important gaps are identified. One gap is between actual practices and the prescriptive use of the conception of responsible management in organizations. The other gap is between the actual use of nano terminology and OECD definitions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Customers; End users; Government agencies responsible management; Insider reports; Nanomaterials standards; Nanotechnology companies; Private sector enterprises; Responsible management",,,,,,"Basart, J.M., Serra, M., Engineering ethics beyond engineers ethics (2013) Sci Eng Ethics, 19, pp. 179-187; Davis, M., Ain't no one here but us social forces: constructing the professional responsibility of engineers (2012) Sci Eng, 18, pp. 13-34; Doorn, N., van de Poel, I., Editors' overview: moral responsibility in technology and engineering (2012) Sci Eng Ethics, 18, pp. 1-11; Foley, R.W., Bennett, I., Wetmore, J., Practitioners' views on responsibility: applying nanoethics (2012) NanoEthics, 6, pp. 231-241; Hart, H.L.A., (1968) Punishment and Responsibility, , New York: Oxford University Press; (2007) Nano risk framework, , http://nanoriskframework.com/, Environmental Defense Fund & the Dupont Corporation, Retrieved March 28, 2011 from; (2013) ISO/TC 229 Nanotechnologies, , http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee?commid=381983, International Standards Organization, Retrieved August 13, 2012 from; (2008) ISO/TS 27687: 2008 Nanotechnologies: Terminology and definitions for nano-objects-Nanoparticle, nanofibre and nanoplate, , https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:ts:27687:ed-1:v1:en, International Standards Organization, Retrieved August 22, 2013 from; Laas, K., Survey of normative materials in the Nanoethics Bank.

Increased SA research on these diseases and syndromes and the collection of associated biospecimens has ensured a plethora of biobanks created by individuals, albeit without the foresight of prospective and collective use by other local and international researchers. As the need for access to high-quality specimens in statistically relevant numbers has increased, so has the necessity for the development of national human biobanks in SA and across the Continent. The prospects of achieving sustainable centralized biobanks are still an emerging and evolving concept, primarily and recently driven by the launch of the H3Africa consortium, which includes the development of harmonized and standardized biobanking operating procedures. This process is hindered by a myriad of complex societal considerations and ethico-legal challenges. Efforts to consolidate and standardize biological sample collections are further compromised by the lack of full appreciation by national stakeholders of the biological value inherent in these collections, and the availability of high quality human samples with well-annotated data for future scientific research and development. Inadequate or nonexistent legislative structures that specifically regulate the storage, use, dispersal, and disposal of human biological samples are common phenomena and pose further challenges. Furthermore, concerns relating to consent for unspecified future uses, as well as access to information and data protection, are all new paradigms that require further consideration and public engagement. This article reviews important fundamental issues such as governance, ethics, infrastructure, and bioinformatics that are important foundational prerequisites for the establishment and evolution of successful human biobanking in South Africa. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"article; biobank; bioinformatics; health care facility; health care quality; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; information system; non communicable disease; priority journal; South Africa; tuberculosis; biobank; biology; ethics; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; legislation and jurisprudence; medical research; organization and management; pathology; preservation; procedures; specimen handling; standards; Biological Specimen Banks; Biomedical Research; Computational Biology; HIV Infections; Humans; Preservation, Biological; South Africa; Specimen Handling; Tuberculosis",,,,,"Bor, J., Herbst, A.J., Newell, M.-L., Increases in adult life expectancy in rural South Africa: Valuing the scale-up of HIV treatment (2013) Science, 339, pp. 961-965; Abayomi, E.A., HIV/AIDS disease burden complex in South Africa: Impact on health and environmental resources, and vulnerability to climate (2013) Climate Vulnerability, pp. 125-143. , Pielke R, ed Academic Press; Hewitt, R.E., Biobanking: The foundation of personalized medicine (2011) Curr Opin Oncol, 23, pp. 112-119; Eiseman, E., Bloom, G., Brower, J., Case Studies of Existing Human Tissue Repositories (2003) Best Practices for A Biospecimen Resource for the Genomic and Proteomic Era, , http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG120, Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation Available from Accessed 21 September 2013; Erasmus, R.T., Soita, D.J., Hassan, M.S., High prevalence of diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome in a South African coloured population: Baseline data of a study in Bellville (2012) S Afr Med J, 102, pp. 841-844. , Cape Town; Matsha, T.E., Soita, D.J., Hassan, M.S., Three-year's changes in glucose tolerance status in the Bellville South cohort: Rates and phenotypes associated with progression (2013) Diabetes Res Clin Pract, 99, pp. 223-230; Mayrhofer, M., Patient organizations as the (un)usual suspects: The biobanking activities of the Association Française contre les Myopathies and its Généthon DNA and Cell Bank (2008) Biobanks: Governance in Comparative Perspectiv, pp. 71-87. , Gottweis H Peterson A. ed 1st edition.

It focuses on an aspect of organization as a voluntary association of economic agents trying to overcome the bounds of their rationality, scope of action and competence, rather than as an 'instrument for entrepreneurial maximizing behavior, and identifies two generic forms of organization as an information system. The paper concludes by discussing the relevance of the evolutionary game model for understanding actual organizational evolutionary processes in North America and Japan. © Masahiko Aoki 2013.

Skous Vej 7, Building 1465-1467, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","This paper concerns the Danish anatomist Nicolaus Steno's years in the service of the Medici Court and argues that his studies of the Earth in Canis cacharia dissectum caput from 1667 and De Solido intra solidum contento dissertationis prodromus from 1669 must be interpreted within this context and in relation to the epistemological approach of the historia-genre present in many early modern medical textbooks. The use of historia enabled Steno to produce knowledge that was both useful as a Medicean instrument of power and allowed him to produce a truthful geological thesis without referral to Aristotelian causes. Traditionally, Steno's geological work has been interpreted teleologically, as a break from contemporary natural philosophy and as an example of a foresight which would not be appreciated properly until several hundred years after his death. Challenging the untenable presentist interpretation, this paper argues that Steno's work on the transformation of the Earth must be understood as inherently connected to the Medici court and their experimental academy - the Accademia del Cimento. © The Geological Society of London 2013.",,"biography; Earth; philosophy; anatomy; canid; fossil; history of geology; knowledge; mortality; Canis; Steno",,,,,"Adams, F.D., The Birth and Development of the Geological Sciences (1938), Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD; Nicolai Stenonis de Musculi et glandulis observationum specimen Cum epistolis duabus anatomicis.

In the Republic of Ireland these costs were estimated at €1.13 billion for 2009. The total direct healthcare costs for six major obesity related conditions (coronary heart disease & stroke, cancer, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and knee osteoarthritis) in the same year were estimated at €2.55 billion. The aim of this research is to project disease burden and direct healthcare costs for these conditions in Ireland to 2030 using the established model developed by the Health Forum (UK) for the Foresight: Tackling Obesities project. Methodology: Routine data sources were used to derive incidence, prevalence, mortality and survival for six conditions as inputs for the model. The model utilises a two stage modelling process to predict future BMI rates, disease prevalence and costs. Stage 1 employs a non-linear multivariate regression model to project BMI trends; stage 2 employs a microsimulation approach to produce longitudinal projections and test the impact of interventions upon future incidence of obesity-related disease. Results: Overweight and obesity are projected to reach levels of 89% and 85% in males and females respectively by 2030. This will result in an increase in the obesity related prevalence of CHD & stroke by 97%, cancers by 61% and type 2 diabetes by 21%. The direct healthcare costs associated with these increases will amount to €5.4 billion by 2030. A 5% reduction in population BMI levels by 2030 is projected to result in €495 million less being spent in obesity-related direct healthcare costs over twenty years. Discussion: These findings have significant implications for policy, highlighting the need for effective strategies to prevent this avoidable health and economic burden. © 2013 keaver et al.",,"adult; article; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; cost benefit analysis; disease association; female; health care cost; human; Ireland; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplastic disease; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prediction; sex ratio; survival rate; trend study; Body Mass Index; Coronary Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Incidence; Ireland; Male; Models, Theoretical; Obesity; Overweight; Patient Outcome Assessment; Prevalence",,,,,"Finucane, M.M., Stevens, G.A., Cowan, M.J., Danaei, G., Lin, J.K., National, regional and global trends in body-mass index since 1980: Systematic analysis of health examination surveys and epidemiological studies with 960 country years and 9.1 million participants (2011) Lancet, 377 (9765), pp. 557-567. , http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10) 62037-5/abstract, Available: Accessed 03/07/2012 doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62037-5.

Games may be designed to accommodate strategies of play of variable time intensity, to assist players' time work, to support dynamics of learning, to encourage knowledge of history and foresight, and to illustrate various economies of time.","Educational Games; Serious Games; Time; Time Frames; Time Work; Timescapes","Educational game; Serious games; Time; Time frame; Time Work; Timescapes; Learning systems; Education",,,,,"Adam, B., The temporal gaze: The challenge for social theory in the context of GM food (2000) British Journal of Sociology, 51 (1), pp. 125-142; Adam, B., (1990) Time and Social Theory, Polity, , Cambridge; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an Ecology of Mind, Ballantine Books, , New York; Chen, J., Flow in games (and everything else) (2007) Communications of the ACM, 50 (4), p. 31; Consalvo, M., There is no magic circle (2009) Games and Culture, 4 (4), pp. 408-417; Eagle, M., Barnes, T., Wu's castle: Teaching arrays and loops in a game (2008) SIGCSE Bull, pp. 245-249. , ACM; Flaherty, M.G., Time work: Customizing temporal experience (2003) Social Psychology Quarterly, 66 (1), pp. 17-33; Gee, J.P., (2003) What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, , Palgrave Macmillan.

Innovation system analysis of emerging technologies is important for the design of technology-specific innovation policy measures to promote desirable futures – This exploratory study uses a functional technological innovation system analysis framework designed to identify policy goals for emerging technological fields. The data consist of 33 qualitative face-to-face interviews with senior managers and decision-makers. Best practices are identified from the San Francisco Bay Area and the Finnish life sciences innovation system is analyzed in detail. – The Finnish system has a good capability to perform top-level basic research, but the commercial aspect is largely missing because of the lack of business know-how, small size of the domestic market, networking failures, scarcity of funding and poor public image. – The two regions have different scopes which prevents direct comparisons between them. – This study applies the technological innovation system model to the life sciences industry. It provides new information on the characteristics of the industry and factors affecting its dynamics. The results can be applied for policy design by policy makers. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Biotechnology; Innovation policy; Life sciences; Technological foresight; Technological innovation system",,,,,,"Amir-Aslani, A., Negassi, S., Is technology integration the solution to biotechnology's low research and development productivity?

Its future milestones lie in two key dimensions: social - combating common and complex diseases, and economic - establishing S&T basis that will provide leadership, or at least a decent niche in the global markets. The paper provides the results of a study conducted by the HSE in cooperation with the member organizations of technology platform ""Medicine of the Future"". It supposes and empirically tests the feasibility of matching challenges and responses aimed at selecting the priorities of S&T development. The study identified underlying trends and S&T areas that will shape the medium and long term prospects of medicine, as well as backlogs allowing gaining strong global market positions. The possible technology responses for the most significant healthcare challenges for Russia are identified, and a priority research agenda is proposed. The authors conclude that Russia lacks breakthrough S&T capacities in the majority of promising medical areas. Meanwhile, domestic advances in some fields still offer the chance for a breakthrough and gaining solid positions on global markets as well as for integration in the value chain. Time to catch up with these opportunities however is running out: most of them are estimated to be available only for the next 5-7 years, so urgent actions are required. These results have been widely discussed in the framework of a range of communication platforms, including that of expert groups preparing the draft state-run programme «Development of Science and Technology for the period up to 2020», and working committees of the technology platform «Medicine of the Future», which are presented at Russian and international conferences.","Global challenges; Innovation policy; Long-term forecast; Medicine and healthcare; Priority areas; S&T capacities; S&T policy",,,,,,"(2012) Osnovnye Statisticheskie Dannye Po VICh V Rossii, , http://www.aidsjournal.ru/pdf/txt_2012_01.pdf, [Main Statistical Data on HIV/AIDS in Russia].

Foresight can be complicated because dispersed groups have diverse, non-overlapping pieces of information that affects an organization's ability to detect, mitigate, and recover from failures. This paper explores the failure of foresight in crisis management by drawing on data on events that preceded and followed the Mari disaster in a naval base in Cyprus in July 2011, where a large explosion killed 13 people and injured 62 others, while completely destroying the major power plant of the island. The paper examines how foresight into crisis management decisions was compromised because of a conscious effort by high ranking decision-makers to minimize emergent danger and avoid responsibility for the crisis, in joint with red tape, bureaucracy, and poor coordination and information flows. The paper explores the notion of operational and political responsibility of individual decision-makers and discusses an alternative approach to foresight in crisis management, one that is built on multiple layers of decision-making. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Crisis management; Disasters; Failure of foresight; Multi-layered decision-making; Responsibility","Crisis management; Decision makers; Information flows; Multi-layered; Multiple layers; Naval Base; Red tape; Responsibility; Behavioral research; Disasters; Failure (mechanical); Decision making; crisis management; decision making; disaster management; mitigation; natural disaster; Cyprus",,,,,"Boin, A., 't Hart, P., Stern, E., Sundelius, B., (2005) The Politics of Crisis Management: Public Leadership under Pressure, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Hynes, T., Prasad, P., Patterns of ""mock bureaucracy"" in mining disasters: an analysis of the Westray coal mining explosion (1997) J.

This model serves as a decision support system within a changing environment, allowing early detection of important business trends. In the first phase, we set the goal of what will be prospected. In the second phase, resources and capabilities are defined. The third phase defines the direction based on prior information. The first control loop is made up, serving as a fast-track feedback making it adaptable to the changing environment. A fourth phase serves to define action plans and measures to achieve the objectives; this stage feeds back to keep the system updated on the progress of measures and actions taken. This model is expected to respond to the following strategic foresight basic questions: what is being sought, where the technologies are, what direction should be taken according to the current environment, and how to get there. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

However, knowledge - and especially knowledge about the future - is not a self-evident element of public policy-making. This paper conceptualizes the problematic relationship between anticipatory policy-making and anticipatory knowledge. Our study identifies possible key-variables in the linkage between foresight and policy, such as positioning, timing interfaces, professional background, instrument usage, procedures and leadership. We describe the organization and flow of policy and futures knowledge. Furthermore, we generalize these findings toward a theory concluding how 'goodness of fit' between knowledge about the future and policy can be achieved, so that the likelihood of informed future-oriented policies might increase. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Foresight; Futures-knowledge; Policy-analysis; Policy-making","future prospect; knowledge; policy analysis; policy making; Netherlands",,,,,"Andersson, J., Future studies for a new era - experiences from the Swedish institute for futures studies (2010) WRR (2010).

The transition of the country from a Communist authoritarian pattern of emergency preparedness to a democratically civilian emergency system challenges the assessment of emergency preparedness and adds more complexity in designing a better and efficient system. The aim of this paper is to briefly describe the risks and institutions dealing with disasters, to assess the emergency preparedness, the uses of Knowledge Management Systems and Foresight Methodology approaches and to discover the shortcomings of the Romanian Emergency System. The empirical study designed as a reality check focuses on the perception of the local leaders of the emergency system regarding the most probable risks, and the uses and utility of long term strategic planning and foresight methodologies, using the Delphi technique. Lessons drawn from the Romanian transition could provide an interesting case study for other emerging democracies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi; Foresight; Knowledge Management; Romanian Emergency System; Strategic planning","Delphi; Emergency preparedness; Emergency system; Empirical studies; Foresight; Knowledge management system; Man-made disasters; Methodology approaches; Disasters; Knowledge management; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Strategic planning; Civil defense; Delphi analysis; future prospect; knowledge based system; natural disaster; perception; planning method; strategic approach; Romania",,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: knowledge management and knowledge management systems: conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Q., 25 (2), pp. 107-136; ISDR, World Bank, South Eastern Europe Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Initiative, , http://www.preventionweb.net/files/1741_SouthEasternEuropeDRMitigation.pdf, available at:; The World Bank, Report No: ISR2623, Hazard Risk Mitigation & Emergency Preparedness Project, , http://www.wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/ECA/2011/06/26/84B52F261BADE174852578BB006392E0/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P0751630ISR0Di026201101309111656798.pdf, available at:; Renn, O., Concepts of risk: an interdisciplinary review- Part 2: integrative approaches (2008) GAIA-Ecol.

This paper presents the first results of a foresight activity that aims to contribute to an understanding of how 'Opening up Education' can improve adult learning in Europe in the future. It argues that to open up adult learning two main challenges must be overcome: the extent to which learners need guidance and, depending on the learning goals, the extent to which learners need recognition and certification. On the basis of these challenges, four non-exclusive scenarios are presented, illustrating different versions and contexts for open adult learning. The main conclusion of the paper is that in order to enhance the quality of adult learning and to avoid the risk of social exclusion, policy-makers need to develop a framework that allows learners to flexibly move between different learning scenarios. Learners also need to acquire 'Open Education Competences'. Finally, a roadmap is presented outlining how this future vision could be implemented. © 2014 © 2014 The Open University.","adult learning; foresight; future; lifelong learning; open education; open educational resources; scenarios",,,,,,"Ala-Mutka, K., Malanowski, N., Punie, Y., Cabrera, M., (2008) Active ageing and the potential of ICT for learning, , http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC45209.pdf, Luxembourg,: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities; Alexiadou, N., van de Bunt-Kokhuis, S., Policy space and the governance of education: Transnational influences on institutions and identities in the Netherlands and the UK (2013) Comparative Education, 49, pp. 344-360; Altbach, P., Reisberg, L., Rumbley, L.E., (2009) Trends in global higher education: Tracking an academic revolution.

The chief interest in the Guide will be in the light it shines on the many difficult substantive and procedural issues concerning reservations and declarations left open by the Vienna Conventions. But the institutional aspects are also of considerable practical interest. The present contribution considers some of the institutional or cooperative bodies that may assist practitioners: depositaries; treaty monitoring bodies; the reservations dialogue; and 'mechanisms of assistance'. The first two are well-established. The third and fourth are innovative, and it remains to be seen whether they will be adopted by states and, if so, how useful they will be. In any event, the Special Rapporteur has shown considerable foresight in proposing what became the annex to the Guide to Practice on the reservations dialogue, as well as the Commission's resolution on 'mechanisms of assistance'. © 2013 The Author.

When the goals of those three entities are focused on near-term results, this poses a significant threat to the integrity, value and relevance of professional services. When the individual and corporate professional’s profit margin, corporate shareholder responsibility and news media sensationalism are factored in, this short-termism dynamic is greatly magnified. Built environment professions are seen as particularly vulnerable to this threat, given that investments in buildings and infrastructure have long-life and high-performance service expectations. This commentary responds to the Building Research & Information special issue entitled ‘New Professionalism’ (2013, volume 40, number 1) and situates the predicament of built environment professionals within an emerging historical transition: that of the post-industrial information society with its characteristic knowledge workers and cybernetic bases of production. Long-term virtues of the built environment mission such as sustainability, public good and evidence-based design are shown to be reflections of the transition from industrial era short-termism to post-industrial systemic foresight. This commentary supplements the special issue papers with a discussion on the broader academy’s potential role in breaking the stranglehold of contemporary short-termism in the built environment professions. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Built environment; Education; Professionalism; Public institutions; Public interest; Universities",,,,,,"This is illustrated in F.G.

Since these costs far exceed the cost of owning and operating the corporate office building, it is becoming obvious to the business world that investment in quality workplaces and employee amenities is necessary to their survival. This power structure and the human capital connection between post-industrial change and New Professionalism are thus elemental to the entire discussion; The corresponding media exception is that of public service corporations such as the BBC (UK), PBS (US) and Al Jezeera (Qatar).

Using a unique dataset of student self-ratings, we find that students experience statistically significant increases in 8 of the 10 leadership dimensions and 7 of the 7 social justice issues examined in this study. Leadership dimensions include: persuasion, building community, ""commitment to the growth of people,"" stewardship, empathy, awareness, foresight, and listening. Interest in social justice issues include: dignity of the human person, community and the common good, rights and responsibilities, option for the poor, dignity of work, solidarity, and care for God's creation. The statistically significant increases in these dimensions following the completion of the service-learning suggest positive effects on students' self-perception of leadership qualities and interests in social justice issues: business school students sense improvement in nurturing growth of employees and colleagues, commitment to serving the need of others, understanding and empathizing with others, ethics, ability to foresee the likely outcome of a situation, and listening intently to others. As a consequence of the financial literacy service-learning, we believe that business students become more prepared toward becoming ethical leaders and citizens with compassion to serve the world for the well-being of all people, rich and poor alike. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ethics; Finance; Financial literacy; Leadership; Service-learning; Social justice",,,,,,"Cagle, J., Baucus, M., Case studies of ethics scandals: Effects on ethical perceptions of finance students (2006) Journal of Business Ethics, 64 (3), pp. 213-229; Cavanagh, G.F., What's good for business?

In particular, risks associated with global supply chains are special since they involve a multitude of international stakeholders with different perspectives on security needs and measures. Therefore, it is essential to determine which techniques and instruments are best suited for risk assessment in complex and multi-organizational environments. The Delphi expert survey technique has proven to be a valuable instrument for long-term decision making support as well as foresight, and has a potential value for risk assessment. We contribute to this research strand and conduct a Delphi-based risk analysis. Our research concentrates on man-made risks in global supply chains which are particularly uncertain in terms of type, location, and affected supply chain partners and can therefore be classified as inherently ""wicked"" issues, i.e. issues that are multidimensional with often unpleasant outcomes. We illustrate that Delphi research makes a fivefold contribution to risk analysis by: (1) identifying and quantifying risks; (2) analyzing stakeholder perceptions and worldviews; (3) stimulating a global communication process; (4) identifying weak signals, outlier opinions, and wildcards; (5) and facilitating risk scenario development. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Risk; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks","Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks; Communication; Research; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Supply chains; Risk analysis; decision making; Delphi analysis; future prospect; perception; risk assessment; stakeholder; terrorism",,,,,"Thun, J.-H., Hoenig, D., An empirical analysis of supply chain risk management in the German automotive industry (2011) Int.

Scenarios can enhance the understanding of emergency teams about the factors which are involved in the definition of an emergency plan and how different actors participate in it. The version of Cross-Impact Analysis described aims at contributing to this goal through allowing the collaborative development of scenarios out of large event sets. This ultimately reduces the complexity for estimating a working model. In order to illustrate this research effort hypothetical results of a dirty bomb attack scenario exercise are presented, along with the final estimates of relationships based on four rounds of individual estimates followed by discussion of differences in the perceived relationships, in order to achieve a ""consensus"" model. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the ability of a group to create a working model of the scenario that may be used to examine the consequences of various assumptions about preparedness, plans, and the actions taken during the crisis situation. The method may be used as either a planning tool and/or a training tool. We discuss the process for collecting inputs from a collaborative group and how to improve the consistency of the group inputs in a Delphi-like feedback process. Suggestions for improving details of the wording of items in order to minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication are included, along with suggestions for future extensions to this research. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","CIA-ISM; Collaboration; Delphi; Dirty bomb; Emergency management; Emergency planning; Foresight; Group modeling; Scenario; Training","CIA-ISM; Collaboration; Delphi; Dirty bomb; Emergency management; Emergency planning; Foresight; Group modeling; Scenario; Bombs (ordnance); Disasters; Estimation; Personnel training; Risk management; Civil defense; Delphi analysis; estimation method; feedback mechanism; future prospect; hypothesis testing; management practice; modeling; research work",,,,,"Freedman, D., A formula for economic calamity (2011) Sci.

The proposed framework is validated with respondents from Nantou County, which is located in Taiwan. This study emphasizes that hospital managers should pay more attention to understanding the five concepts of health belief of elderly (Perceived Susceptibility, Perceived Severity, Perceived Benefits, Perceived Barriers and Cues to Action), and improving Self Efficacy of elderly. We adopted the questionnaire survey for data collection, and examined our hypotheses by applying the structural equation modeling (SEM) method to validate the model. The integrative viewpoint implies that a successful telecare system is not only an information system but also a medical service provider/department to the patients/residents. The findings may be used as a theoretical basis for future research and can also offer empirical foresight to the executives and managers of hospitals when they initially introduce and promote the telecare systems into their surrounding community. © 2013 IEEE.","Cues to Action; Health Belief Model; Perceived Barriers; Perceived Benefits; Perceived Severity; Perceived Susceptibility; Self Efficacy; Telecare","Cues to Action; Health belief model; Perceived Barriers; Perceived benefits; Perceived Severity; Perceived susceptibility; Self efficacy; Telecare; Information science; Managers; Health",,,,,"Rosenstock, M.I., Historical origins of the health belief model (1974) Health Education Monographs, 2 (4), pp. 328-335; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84 (2), pp. 191-215; Dewsbury, G., (2009) Defining Telecare?, , http://www.gdewsbury.ukideas.com/telecaredefined.html, June 17, Retrieved from April 5; (2007) A Pilot Project of Telecare in Taiwan, , http://doh.telecare.com.tw/, Department of Health of Executive Yuan.

This distinction is attributed to R&D, innovations and applications leading to harnessing the rare combination of properties of stainless steels, since its discovery hundred years back. Though the initial discovery of stainless steel is basically serendipity, and based on previous work, its indispensable position today, in many a wide range of applications is due to intense R&D efforts in understanding its physical, chemical, thermal and thermo-mechanical response for various chemistries and microstructures. A deliberate attempt to extend its application spectrum through various routes of manufacturing in the last century is another crucial aspect of the success story. The first part of the presentation would briefly review this exciting journey of unravelling the mysteries of stainless steels. The second part of the presentation would highlight the evolution of stainless steels in the nuclear industry, especially for the sodium cooled fast reactors. Early 70's have seen the application of stainless steels in first generation water based nuclear power plants and AISI types 304 and 316 SS was recommended for structural and core applications in fast spectrum reactors (FSR). Failure of some of the components even in the manufacturing stage and quest for improving mechanical properties and sensitisation and intergranular corrosion resistances resulted in the development of 304L, 304LN, 316L, 316LN SS during 1980-90 for further applications in FSRs. Towards core applications in intense radiation environments, three generations of stainless steels namely 20% cold worked 316 SS, D9, and D9I have been developed to yield high burnup and to triple the lifetime of the core components of the fast reactors. Towards closing the fuel cycle, again 304L SS was the workhorse material which was upgraded with newer varieties like nitric acid grade alloys for improved corrosion resistance and longer life. Manufacturing of special grades of SS and the developments in fabrication technologies was necessary in order to enhance the performance of components and to avoid failures. Welding, inspection, quality assurance and structural integrity of various components of SS for FSRs and fuel cycle facilities resulted in developments in areas like modelling, devices, methodologies and analysis. An opportunity existed for the development and application of innovative non-destructive testing techniques for robust examination of critical components. Nuclear industry is embarking a state of the art fourth generation reactors. The consequent newer generation of SS are evolving with improved properties to match the expectations of performance in increased temperature, pressure, chemical and other physical constraints. It is of paramount importance to consider the extension of the lifetime of the current reactors from 40-60 to 60-80 years for economic considerations, and in this regard innovations are necessary in the development of newer varieties of stainless steels with respect to modelling and life prediction, manufacturing, fabrication, testing and evaluation. Thus the management approach to knit a network of industryresearch-academia is a key approach for way forward. A development of roadmap for robust science based technology development with foresight is a desired management strategy. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Design principles; Fabricability; Historical review of development of stainless steels; Modelling aided alloy development; Stainless steels in sodium cooled fast spectrum reactor applications; Weldability and stainless steels for aggressive environments in back end of nuclear fuel cycle","Aggressive environment; Alloy development; Design Principles; Fabricability; Fast spectrum reactors; Historical review; Corrosion resistance; Fast reactors; Manufacture; Mechanical properties; Nondestructive examination; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Plant shutdowns; Quality assurance; Reactor cores; Sodium; Stainless steel",,,,,"http:///www.EngineeringToolBox.com/stainless_steel_classifications_d_368.html, Information on; Alvarez-Armas, I., Degallaix-Moreuil, S., (2013) Duplex Stainless Steels, , John Wiley & Sons Inc., NJ; Perelome, E., Edmonds, D.V., (2012) Phase Transformations In Steels, 57. , Woodhead Publishing Series in Metals and Surface Engineering, Woodhead Publishing Ltd., Cambridge, UK; (1988), 75 Years of Stainless Steel 1913-1988, British Steel Stainless, Shaffield, UK; Payet-Gaspard, P., (2012), Stainless steel a bright future in a changing world?

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model consists of eight-steps. For the first step the authors propose two studies: trends analysis and change drivers' identification; these help to identify the most relevant trends in areas that may affect the business activities. All this information is put into a Delphi process with the help of experts in order to find the common denominator of where the future is going; afterwards, with this information, the authors can build events and scenarios for the business opportunities. Then, a diagnostic of the study area, sector or organization through the dynamic diagnostic methods is performed. Findings: Once the opportunities have been identified, a strategic analysis that allows decision making to prioritize and define the activities or projects that may be achievable in the future is done, and the result of the process is a portfolio of business opportunities projects fully defined and ready to be planned with a roadmap. Originality/value: The proposed model allows the managers to consistently organize their development processes targeted to real business opportunities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business opportunity; Change drivers; Delphi; Scenarios; Technology foresight; Technology roadmap; Trends",,,,,,"Bers, J.A., Dismukes, J.P., Miller, L.K., Dubrovensky, A., Accelerated radical innovation: Theory and application (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76 (1), pp. 165-177; Burgelman, R.A., Christensen, C.M., Wheelwright, S.C., (2009) Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation, , McGraw-Hill Irwin, Boston, MA; Chen, P.-T., Cheng, J.Z., Unlocking the promise of mobile value-added services by applying new collaborative business models (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (4), pp. 678-693; Christensen, C.M., (2006) The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business, , HarperBusiness Essentials, New York, NY; Curran, C.-S., Bröring, S., Leker, J., Anticipating converging industries using publicly available data (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (3), pp. 385-395; de Miranda Santo, M., Coelho, G.M., dos Santos, D.M., Filho, L.F., Text mining as a valuable tool in foresight exercises: A study on nanotechnology (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73 (8), pp. 1013-1027; Dismukes, J.P., Miller, L.K., Bers, J.A., Sekhar, J.A., Shelbrooke, A.E., Accelerated radical innovation (ARI) methodology validation (2009) Proc., Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology, PICMET, 2009, pp. 677-691; Fenwick, D., Daim, T.U., Gerdsri, N., Value driven technology road mapping (VTRM) process integrating decision making and marketing tools: Case of internet security technologies (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76 (8), pp. 1055-1077; Glenn, J.C., (2008) Scenario, , The Futures Group, Washington, DC; Godet, M., (1993) De La Anticipación a La Acción: Manual De Prospectiva Y Estrategia, , Barcelona; Gordon, T., 'Cross impact analysis', Futures Research Methodology V3.0 (2009), The Millenium Project; Güemes, D., (2007) Technological Megatrends.

A carbon release of this magnitude is unprecedented during the past 56 million years- and the outcome accordingly difficult to predict. In this regard, the geological record may provide foresight to how the Earth system will respond in the future. Here, we discuss the long-term legacy of massive carbon release into the Earth's surface reservoirs, comparing the Anthropocene with a past analogue, the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, approx. 56Ma). We examine the natural processes and time scales of CO 2 neutralization that determine the atmospheric lifetime of CO 2 in response to carbon release. We compare the duration of carbon release during the Anthropocene versus PETM and the ensuing effects on ocean acidification and marine calcifying organisms. We also discuss the conundrum that the observed duration of the PETM appears to be much longer than predicted by models that use firstorder assumptions. Finally, we comment on past and future mass extinctions and recovery times of biotic diversity.","Anthropogenic carbon; Climate; Eocene; Ocean acidification; Palaeo","Acidification; Carbon; Global warming; Anthropogenic carbon; Climate; Eocene; Ocean acidifications; Palaeo; Carbon dioxide",,,,,"Peters, G.P., Marland, G., Le, Q.C., Boden, T., Canadell, J.G., Raupach, M.R., Rapid growth in CO2 emissions after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis (2012) Nat.

In the literature, DCMs are usually studied piecemeal and have not been studied in health organizations in a broader organizational context. Thus, this study aims to identify the use of DCMs and the frequency with which they are inspected, maintained and reviewed for design flaws. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained by questionnaire from decision-making executives in hospitals, medical centers, aged care, pharmacies, dental clinics and practices in physiotherapy, chiropractic and podiatry. Findings: Heavy reliance was placed on planning and technological DCMs while human and social methods were typically not considered. Organizations considered limited crisis types and there was a disconnect between the types of DCMs and the crises they targeted. Over half the organizations reviewed DCMs annually or more frequently. Backup DCMs mostly consisted of on-call staff and first responders with some auxiliary communications systems. Interviewees stated that these were designed to prevent financial, equipment breakdown, human resource and occupational safety crises. Originality/value: Most organizations had inadequate DCMs due to a lack of top-down support, planning and foresight. Furthermore, these health organizations demonstrated a lack of understanding of what DCMs are and how they function. The conclusion is that most of the health organizations surveyed are crisis-prone and health leaders need to put more effort into looking broadly at DCMs to improve organizational preparedness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Health leadership competencies; Organizational culture; Organizational design; Organizational structure; Quality management; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Ackoff, R., (1999) Re-Creating the Corporation: A Design of Organizations for the 21st Century, , Oxford University Press; Barnett, D.J., Balicer, R.D., Lucey, D.R., Everly Jr., G.S., Omer, S.B., Steinhoff, M.C., Grotto, I., A systematic analytic approach to pandemic influenza preparedness planning (2005) PLoS Medicine, 2 (12), pp. 1235-1241; Fink, S., (1986) Crisis Management: Planning for the Inevitable, , American Management Association, New York, NY; Hensgenn, T., Desouzann, K.C., Kraft, G.D., Games, signal detection, and processing in the context of crisis management (2003) Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management, 11 (2), pp. 67-77; Lagadec, P., (1993) Preventing Chaos in a Crisis: Strategies for Prevention, Control and Damage Limitation, , McGraw Hill, Cambridge; McCoy, L.C., Harrald, J.R., McManis, D.Y., Tuttle, J.O., (2001) Crisis Management as a Function of Information Exchange, , National Institute for Urban Search and Rescue, Washington, DC; Miller, E.W., The Valdez oil spill: Environmental, economic and social impacts (1992) Natural and Technological Disasters: Causes, Effects and Preventative Measures, , Majumdar, S.K., Forbes, G.S., Miller, E.W., Schmalz, R.F.

Design/methodology/approach - The empirical material of this paper includes a multiple-case study with an embedded design (Yin) including four cases, where each case represents a production system design project. The consideration of reconfigurability and its characteristics in the production system design projects was studied. To enhance validity, two real-time studies were combined with two retrospective studies (Leonard-Barton). Findings - For more than a decade foresight reports have pointed out the need for responsiveness to change through reconfigurability in production system design. In order to achieve reconfigurable production systems, three challenges were identified: to use a structured design methodology, to gain knowledge in reconfigurability and its characteristics, and to include the reconfigurability knowledge in a structured design methodology. Still there is no comprehensive support available for reconfigurability in the production system design process. Research limitations/implications - Limitations are mostly related to the chosen methodology approach, and additional empirical studies to establish generic results are required. Practical implications - By combining knowledge from the production system design field with the reconfigurable manufacturing system field a potential of meeting identified challenges is pointed out. Originality/value - This paper adds to current knowledge by pointing out three main challenges to achieving reconfigurable production systems. The paper also contributes with ideas on how to respond to these challenges. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The main questions concern whether the animals can prepare for upcoming situations which are, to various degrees, contextually or sensorially detached from the situation in which the preparations are made. Studies on great apes have focused on tool-related tasks, e.g., the ability to select a tool which is functional only in the future. Dufour and Sterck (2008), however, investigated whether chimpanzees were also able to prepare for a future exchange with a human: an object exchanged for a food item. The study included extensive training on the exchangeable item, which is traditionally not compatible with methods for studying planning abilities, as associative learning cannot be precluded. Nevertheless, despite this training, the chimpanzees could not solve the deferred exchange task. Given that great apes can plan for tool use, these results are puzzling. In addition, claims that great ape foresight is highly limited has been based on this study (Suddendorf and Corballis, 2010). Here we partly replicated Dufour and Sterck's study to discern whether temporally deferred and spatially displaced exchange tasks are beyond the capabilities of great apes. In addition to chimpanzees we tested orangutans. One condition followed the one used by Dufour and Sterck, in which the exchange items, functional only in the future, are placed at a location that freely allows for selections by the subjects. In order to test the possibility that the choice set-up could explain the negative results in Dufour and Sterck's study, our second condition followed a method used in the planning study by Osvath and Osvath (2008), where the subjects make a forced one-item-choice from a tray. We found that it is within the capabilities of chimpanzees and orangutans to perform deferred exchange in both conditions.2013 Osvath and Persson.","Chimpanzees; Episodic cognition; Exchange; Future oriented cognition; Great apes; Orangutans",,,,,,"Berntsen, D., Staugaard, S.R., Sørensen, L.M., Why am I remembering this now. predicting the occurrence of involuntary (spontaneous) episodic memories (2013) J.

However, it remained unclear whether 4-year-olds can similarly use such information to solve a problem for a more removed future episode that is not of immediate concern. In the current study we introduced 4-year-olds to problems in one room before taking them to another room and distracting them for 15 min. The children were then offered a choice of items to place into a bucket that was to be taken back to the first room when a 5-min sand-timer had completed a cycle. Across two conceptually distinct domains, the children placed the item that could solve the deferred future problem above chance level. This result demonstrates that by 48 months many children can recall a problem from the past and act in the present to solve that problem for a deferred future episode. We discuss implications for theories about the nature of episodic foresight. © 2013 Redshaw and Suddendorf.","Episodic foresight; Episodic memory; Mental time travel; Planning; Problem solving",,,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377. , doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.10.016; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Age-related changes in the episodic simulation of future events (2008) Psychol.

It is a creative methodology that uses a variety of concepts and tools to guide participants through the conception and modeling of enterprises, services, social innovations and projects in the context of emerging futures.

First it aims to set the context of quantification approaches for strategic planning in foresight. Within world models, qualitative scenarios allow for a contingency perspective of the future, however their potential to be linked to strategic planning in corporate foresight is limited. In contrast to complex world models, forecasts on key indicators are easily applied to strategy processes, but lack the necessary capability to recognise uncertainty and decision points. The paper seeks to argue for a new participative and pragmatic approach in order to bridge the gap between the opposing approaches and aims to show how this quantification approach can be integrated with scenario construction on an operational level. Design/methodology/approach: The authors discuss a quantitative scenario process and argue for its suitability to corporate foresight. They then describe a range of leanings from various foresight projects that have successfully applied quantified scenarios to strategic planning. Findings: Quantified scenarios can increase the impact foresight thinking has on corporate strategic planning. Research limitations/implications: The paper outlines the methods and tools of quantified corporate foresight, it does not include empirical evidence or concrete case studies. Practical implications: The approach outlined here can be used in corporate foresight projects in order to improve the use of scenario planning for strategy. Originality/value: This paper is the first one to outline a process for scenario quantification within corporate foresight. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Forecasting; Scenario planning; Strategy; Systems theory; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Bell, W., (2007) Foundations of Future Studies, 1. , Transaction Publishers, Piscataway, NJ; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: An overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario types and techniques: Towards a user's guide (2006) Futures, 38 (7), pp. 723-739; (2009) STEEP Analysis Compendium, , www.branz.co.nz/cms_show_download.php?id=46b563c9ba1f7351372de4997c845cb12725d0e6, available at:, BRANZ; Flyvbjerg, C., (2004) Procedures for Dealing with Optimism Bias in Transport Planning: Guidance Document, , UK Department for Transport, London; Fontela, E., Bridging the gap between scenarios and models (2000) Foresight, 2 (1), pp. 10-14; Fontela, E., (2000) Leontief and the future of the world economy, , paper presented at 13th International Conference on Input-Output Techniques; Forrester, J.W., Industrial dynamics. a major breakthrough for decision makers (1958) Harvard Business Review, 36 (4), pp. 37-66; Forrester, J.W., (1971) World Dynamics, , Wright-Allen Press, Cambridge, MA; Glenn, C.J., Gordon, T.J., (2012) Futures Research Methodology Version 3.0, , www.millennium-project.org/millennium/FRM-V3.html, available at; Godet, M., (2001) Creating Futures.

In foresight studies, usually their positive impact on the quality of life is considered or their negative environmental effects. This paper seeks to draw attention to an overlooked ""dark side"" of new technologies: their potential abuse by terrorists or organized crime. Recent cybercrime events are examples of abuse that perhaps could have been minimized if appropriate foresight studies were performed years ago. This was the aim of the recently completed EU-funded project FESTOS. Design/methodology/approach: Several foresight methodologies were employed. Following a horizon scanning for potentially threatening technologies, a Delphi-type expert survey helped to evaluate critical threat characteristics of selected 33 technologies: the likelihood that each technology will actually come to pose a security threat (in different time frames), the easiness of its malicious use, the severity of the threat, and the most threatened societal spheres. Findings: The results enabled ranking the technologies by their ""abuse potential"" and ""threat intensity"". Certain emerging technologies (or their combinations), regarded as ""weak signals"", inspired ideas for potential ""wild cards"". In a subsequent workshop, which employed a variant of the ""futures wheel"" method, four wild-card ""scenario sketches"" were constructed. These were later developed to full narrative scenarios. Originality/value: The entire process enables the introduction of security foresight into policy planning in a long-range perspective. The foresight results were followed by the evaluation of policy implications and coping with the knowledge control dilemma. The paper illustrates how a mix of foresight methods can help in a continuous analysis of new and threats posed by emerging technologies, thus raising awareness of decision makers and mitigating the risk of unforeseen surprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Emerging technologies; Foresight; Future threats; Security; Signals of change; Wild cards",,,,,,"Auffermann, B., Luoto, L., (2011) Integrated Security Threats Report, FESTOS Deliverable D3.3, , http://tinyurl.com/9auvja8, partners with contribution from all, available at; Brown, J., Isaacs, D., (2005) The World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That Matter, , Berrett-Koehler, San Francisco, CA; Dienel, H.L., Peperhove, R., (2011), Final Scenario and Indicators Report, FESTOS Deliverable D4.3; Glenn, J.C., (2009) The Futures Wheel, in Futures Research Methodology - V3.0, , Glenn, J.C., Gordon, T.J.

The province also instituted Integrated Water Resources Management by Watershed (IWRM) for all of mainland Quebec. Shortly after, the Conseil de la Science et la Technologie (CST) gathered a group of experts to develop a research strategy to apply IWRM. The research strategy was developed as part of the Perspectives STS Project started in 2003 by the CST in concert with other ministerial partners. As a foresight-type study, the objective of the perspectives STS is to identify the challenges that Quebec will face over the next several years and to determine how research could contribute to the development of solutions.

The intent is to enable simple yet reliable enterprise assessment of triple bottom line (TBL) performance and produce actionable enterprise foresight that can enable next best practices and sources of sustainable competitive advantage through innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Key elements of SEE are identified from various business excellence and sustainability reporting sources, including the Global Reporting Initiative, the UN Global Compact 10 Principles, and criteria of the European Quality Award and America's Baldrige National Quality Award. From these a model and key criteria are distilled, maturity scales developed, and a simple means of assessment presented. Findings: A compact model and supporting maturity assessment approach similar in structure to those behind established excellence awards are developed that enable enterprise assessment of progress toward SEE. The resulting assessment is delivered in a highly consumable, combined narrative and graphic format referred to as a SEE NEWS Report. Practical implications: The assessment approach presented enables both enterprise progress toward Sustainable Enterprise Excellence and enterprise-to-enterprise comparability. Foresight provided by the assessment enables further advancement.

Geostatistical interpolation of non-assay data allows the mine planner to estimate quality parameters regarding mining. The foresight can then be used for more timely and accurate seam blending protocols. This paper discusses the modelling and the spatial variability of three coal parameters, namely calorific value, ash content, and sulphur content, of a coal seam in Malinau, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. It is concluded that the use of the kriging procedure is strongly influenced by the amount of drill-hole data and their areal distribution. The results are more realistic when more drill-hole data are available and the distribution is even. It is thus worthwhile to consider the inclusion of geostatistical methods into mine planning as they can identify the errors associated with large reserve tonnage and quality estimates when used appropriately. The use of these methods could be a good opportunity to enhance mine planning in Indonesia.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted within the scope of an interdisciplinary foresight conference, where a group of 216 renowned persons from 16 countries in business, academia and politics discussed policies and strategies for the future role of logistics as an enabler and driver of global wealth. Attendants were asked to share their visions of the future via a real-time Delphi study. The results were further discussed in futures workshops according to World Café methodology for group dialog. Findings: Based on extensive desk research of scenario studies, expert workshops, and creative sessions, the authors developed 20 key Delphi projections for global logistics in 2025. Experts were asked to rate the projection's probability, impact, and desirability as well as to provide reasons for all answers via the Delphi online-portal. Key topics of the Delphi-based scenarios include global health care supply chains, resource logistics (urban mining), water transportation, energy supply, and education. Moreover, the authors analysed discontinuities in global logistics, such as pandemics, conflicts, and resource crises. Originality/value: The increasing impact of logistics on a nation's and company's success underlines the importance of future-oriented and sustainable planning in this field. With this research endeavor, the authors provide insights in action needed to be taken by industry, politics and academia in order to leverage the full potentials of logistics and support the economic development of the world. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change; Delphi; Globalization; Logistics; Sustainability; Wealth",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Avner, J., Brandenburg, R.G., Partner, F.E., Radosevich, R., Does planning pay?

Experimental comparisons on 10 datasets indicate that pruning a hetrogeneous ensemble of classifiers using the proposed measure achieves higher accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art measures. © 2013 IEEE.","Ensemble method; ensemble pruning; ensemble selection; evaluation mearsure; forward selection; hill climbing algorithm","Ensemble methods; Ensemble pruning; Ensemble selections; evaluation mearsure; Forward selection; Hill climbing algorithms; Algorithms; Robotics",,,,,"Tan, P.N., Steinbach, M., Kumar, V., Introduction to data mining (2006) Pearson Addison-Wesley, , Upper Saddle River, NJ; Kuncheva, L.I., Combining pattern classifiers, methods and algorithms (2004) Wiley-Intersciene, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ; Wolpert, H., The lack of a priori distinctions between learning algorithms (1996) Neural Computation, 8, pp. 1341-1390; Dietterich, T.G., Ensemble methods in machine learning (2000) Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop in Multiple Classifier Systems, pp. 1-15; Kuncheva, L.I., Whitaker, C.J., Measures of diversity in classifier ensembles and their relationship with the ensemble accuracy (2003) Machine Learning, 51 (2), pp. 181-207; Banfield, R.E., Hall, L.O., Bowyer, K.W., Kegelmeyer, W.P., Ensemble diversity measures and their application to thinning (2005) Information Fusion, 6 (1), pp. 49-62; Caruana, R., Niculescu-Mizil, A., Crew, G., Ksikes, A., Ensemble selection from libraries of models (2004) Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Machine Learning; Hernandez-Lobato, D., Martinez-Munoz, G., Suarez, A., Statistical instance-based pruning in ensembles of independent classifiers (2009) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31 (2), pp. 364-369; Margineantu, D., Dietterich, T., Pruning adaptive boosting (1997) Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Machine Learning; Martinez-Munoz, G., Suarez, A., Aggregation ordering in bagging (2004) International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Applications (IASTED); Martinez-Munoz, G., Suarez, A., Pruning in ordered bagging ensembles (2006) 23rd International Conference in Machine Learning, , ICML; Partalas, I., Tsoumakas, G., Vlahavas, I., Pruning an ensemble of classifiers via reinforcement learning (2009) Neurocomputing, Elsevier, 72, pp. 1900-1909; Partalas, I., Tsoumakas, G., Vlahavas, I., An ensemble uncertainty aware measure for directed hill climbing ensemble pruning (2010) Machine Leanring, Springer, 81, pp. 257-282; Tsymbal, A., Decision committee learning with dynamic integration of classifiers (2000) DBIS-DASFAA Symposium on Advances in Databases and Information Systems; Zhou, Z.-H., Tang, W., Selective Ensemble of Decision Trees (2003) LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, (2639), pp. 476-483. , Rough Sets, Fuzzy Sets, Data Mining, and Granular Computing; Zhou, Z.-H., Wu, J., Tang, W., Ensembling neural networks: Many could be better than all (2002) Artificial Intelligence, 137 (1-2), pp. 239-263. , DOI 10.1016/S0004-3702(02)00190-X, PII S000437020200190X; Prodromidis, A., Chan, P., Meta-learning in distributed data mining systems: Issues and approaches (2000) ""Advances of Distributed Data Mining,"" MIT, , H.

We first review the literature on strategic foresight, innovation management and strategic management in order to identify the potential value contributions. We use survey data from 77 large multinational firms to assess how much value is generated from formalized strategic foresight practices in these firms. We show that it is possible to capture value through (1) an enhanced capacity to perceive change, (2) an enhanced capacity to interpret and respond to change, (3) influencing other actors, (4) and through an enhanced capacity for organizational learning. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Organizational future orientation; Strategic foresight; Value creation; Weak signals","Innovation management; Multinational firms; Organizational future orientations; Organizational learning; Strategic foresight; Strategic management; Value creation; Weak signals; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Industry; empirical analysis; innovation; multinational enterprise; organizational change; strategic approach; technological development",,,,,"Schwarz, J.O., (2006) The Future of Futures Studies: A Delphi Study with a German Perspective, Shaker, Aachen; Schwarz, J.O., Assessing the future of futures studies in management (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 237-246; Daheim, C., Uerz, G., Corporate foresight in Europe: ready for the next step?

By 2050 it is estimated that 70% of the world's population will live in cities. The critical challenge for contemporary urbanism, therefore, is to understand how to develop the knowledge, capacity and capability for public agencies, the private sector and multiple users in city-regions (i.e. the city and its wider hinterland) to re-engineer systemically their built environment and urban infrastructure in response to climate change and resource constraints. To inform transitions to urban sustainability, key stakeholders' perceptions were sought though a participatory backcasting and scenario foresight process in order to illuminate challenging but realistic socio-technical scenarios for the systemic retrofit of core UK city-regions. The challenge of conceptualizing complex urban transitions is explored across multiple socio-technical regimes (housing, non-domestic buildings, urban infrastructure), scales (building, neighbourhood, city-region), and domains (energy, water, use of resources) within a participatory process. The development of three archetypal guiding visions of retrofit city-regional futures developed through this process are discussed, along with the contribution that such foresight processes might play in opening up the governance and strategic navigation of urban sustainability. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation; cities; climate change; retrofit; sustainability; transitions; urban; visions","adaptation; cities; Global carbon emission; Participatory backcasting; retrofit; Socio-technical regimes; Socio-technical scenarios; urban; Climate change; Electron transitions; Energy utilization; Regional planning; Retrofitting; Vision; Sustainable development",,,,,"Bai, X., Integrating global concerns into urban management: The scale argument and readiness arguments (2007) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 11 (2), pp. 15-29. , (doi:10.1162/jie.2007.1202); Bai, X., McAllister, R., Beaty, R., Taylor, B., Urban policy and governance in a global environment: Complex systems, scale mismatches and public participation (2010) Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 2, pp. 1-7. , (doi:10.1016/j.cosust.2010.05.008); Bai, X., Roberts, B.H., Chen, J., Urban sustainability experiments in Asia: Patterns and pathways (2010) Environmental Science and Policy, 13, pp. 312-325. , (doi:10.1016/j.envsci.2010.03.011); Batty, M., Building A Science of Cities, , UCL Working Papers Series No. 170.

Too much is made of secrecy, and of covert operations and counter-intelligence (action domains informed by intelligence rather than integral to it). Intelligence is often focused on threats, missing opportunities for advantage. A standard definition is proposed for better understanding of intelligence by the academy, media and public. Intelligence is a corporate capability to forecast change in time to do something about it. The capability involves foresight and insight, and is intended to identify impending change which may be positive, representing opportunity, or negative, representing threat. Definitions which converge with this proposal are found in several intelligence settings. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"(2011), http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/intelligence4, accessed 30 July; (2011), http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/intelligence_1, accessed 30 July; (2011), http://www.vetta.org/definitions-of-intelligence/4, accessed 30 July; http://www.vetta.org/2008/07/machine-super-intelligence/4, Note; Hulnick, A., What's Wrong with the Intelligence Cycle?

We examine investment choices under an inflexible (traditional) emissions rate performance standard for new sources. We compare the inflexible standard with a flexible one that imposes an alternative compliance payment (surcharge) for emissions in excess of the standard. A third policy allows the surcharge revenue to fund later retrofits. Analytical results indicate that increasing flexibility leads to earlier introduction of new technology, lower aggregate emissions and higher profits. We test this using multi-stage stochastic optimization for introduction of carbon capture and storage, with uncertain future natural gas and emissions allowance prices. Under perfect foresight, the analytical predictions hold. With uncertainty these predictions hold most often, but we find exceptions. In some cases investments are delayed to enable the decision maker to discover additional information. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Carbon capture and storage; Climate change; Technology standards; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Al-Juaied, M., Whitmore, A., (2009) Realistic costs of carbon capture, , Discussion Paper 2009-2008.

These mouths need to be fed and the nutritional quality of the food received will be a key determinant of future health. Alongside this expansion in the world's population, rapid economic growth in China, India and South America is increasing demand for protein-rich foods, especially meat and dairy products, causing concern about the impact this may have on green house gas emissions. As economies strengthen and dietary and lifestyle patterns become more westernised, the so-called diseases of affluence are becoming ever more evident, often alongside malnutrition.

In the 21st century increased interconnectivity and interdependence requires management of complex systems (i.e. coupled human, natural and technological systems) where decision making and planning for the future are far from straightforward. Moreover, a greater awareness of sustainability and resiliency issues (e.g. engineering within resource constraints and climate change such that engineering solutions continue to deliver their intended benefits in the face of change) now requires consideration of a range of possible city changes and assessment of their short- and long-term impacts. Decision making in the face of such uncertainty requires interdisciplinary foresight tools that facilitate understanding and communication between diverse ranges of stakeholders. To facilitate this process, a newly developed future performance framework (FPF) is proposed. When used in conjunction with the long-term future scenario-based urban futures (UF) methodology and the UF (Excel-based) tool, the FPF demonstrates how to embed futures thinking within an earth systems engineering framework.","Environment; Sustainability","Earth Systems Engineering; Engineering solutions; Environment; Future performance; Performance frameworks; Scenarios analysis; Technological system; Urban environments; Climate change; Decision making; Tools; Sustainable development",,,,,"Allenby, B.R., Earth systems engineering: The role of industrial ecology in an engineered world (1999) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 2 (3), pp. 73-93. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jiec.1998.2.3.73; Allenby, B.R., Earth systems engineering.

Even if initial attempts have been made to operationalize the concept of resilience, a gap exists between the intense theoretical discussion and the use of resilience thinking in planning practice. On the basis of a discussion of existing attempts that define resilience principles, the authors derive eight principles for urban and regional resilience: diversity, redundancy, flexibility and adaptability, modularity, interdependency, stabilizing and buffering factors, mobility, as well as planning and foresight. Referring to two exploratory studies-the City and Region of Stockholm (Sweden) and the City and Region of Rostock (Germany)-this article aims to explore whether spatial planning already contributes to these principles and so to build resilience. The analysis shows that spatial planning already contributes to urban and regional resilience. Also, the principles, as suggested here, can be used to operationalize the idea of resilience. Prospectively, such principles may support spatial planning to choose adaptation measures and specific objectives and to contribute to urban and regional resilience. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,"climate change; conceptual framework; planning practice; regional planning; uncertainty analysis; urban development; urban planning; Germany; Mecklenburg-West Pomerania; Rostock; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden",,,,,"Alberti, M., Blanco, H., Building capacity to adapt to climate change through planning (2009) Hot, Congested, Crowded and Diverse: Emerging Research Agendas in Planning (Progress in Planning, 71), pp. 158-169. , In: Blanco H., Alberti M., Forsyth A., Krizek K.

Most of the tens of thousands of the discovered terpenoids are synthesized by plants, where they function as primary metabolites involved in growth and development, or as secondary metabolites that optimize the interaction between the plant and its environment. Several plant terpenoids are economically important molecules that serve many applications as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, etc. Major challenges for the commercialization of plant-derived terpenoids include their low production levels in planta and the continuous demand of industry for novel molecules with new or superior biological activities. Here, we highlight several synthetic biology methods to enhance and diversify the production of plant terpenoids, with a foresight towards triterpenoid engineering, the least engineered class of bioactive terpenoids. Increased or cheaper production of valuable triterpenoids may be obtained by 'classic' metabolic engineering of plants or by heterologous production of the compounds in other plants or microbes. Novel triterpenoid structures can be generated through combinatorial biosynthesis or directed enzyme evolution approaches. In its ultimate form, synthetic biology may lead to the production of large amounts of plant triterpenoids in in vitro systems or custom-designed artificial biological systems. © 2013 The Authors.

We constructed a two-way, multifactor risk assessment framework for predicting adult obesity during childhood using the Foresight Obesity System Map and tested it against longitudinal data from the 1958 National Child Development Study. Methods The framework divided study participants according to two categories of risk: 'conditioning factors' (past/fixed events and conditions) and 'intervention factors' (present and modifiable). At the age of 11 years, conditioning factors were 'low/high birth weight' and 'absence of breastfeeding', and intervention factors were 'low childhood activity level' and 'having at least one obese parent'. From a composite score of all four variables, study participants were assigned to one of the four risk groups: low risk, past 'conditioning' risk only, present 'intervention' risk only and high combined risk. ORs and relative risks for the development of future overweight/obesity at ages 23, 33 and 42 years were calculated for each risk group. Results Those identified in the highest risk category at the age of 11 were around twice as likely to become overweight (body mass index (BMI)=25 kg/m2) by the age of 23 years, and obese (BMI=30 kg/m2) by ages 33 and 42 years, in comparison to their low-risk peers (total sample, N=11 752). Increased prevalence of future obesity was also observed for high-risk children who were not already overweight at the age of 11 (filtered sample, N=9549). Conclusions This framework identifies a greater proportion of the population that is at risk for future obesity than does childhood weight assessment alone.",,"adult; body size; child development; child health; health risk; mapping; obesity; population characteristics; risk assessment; adult; article; birth weight; body mass; breast feeding; cohort analysis; female; human; infant; male; methodology; obesity; paediatric; physical activity; predictive value; preschool child; prevalence; risk; risk assessment; risk factor; United Kingdom; BIRTH WEIGHT; BREAST FEEDING; OBESITY; PAEDIATRIC; PHYSICAL ACTIVITY; Adult; Body Mass Index; Breast Feeding; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Infant; Male; Obesity; Odds Ratio; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",,,,,"Rolland-Cachera, M.-F., Peneau, S., Assessment of growth: variations according to references and growth parameters used (2011) Am J Clin Nutr, 94, pp. 1794S-8S; Janssen, I., Katzmarzyk, P.T., Srinivasan, S.R., Utility of childhood BMI in the prediction of adulthood disease: comparison of national and international references (2005) Obes Res, 13, pp. 1106-15; Parsons, T.J., Power, C., Logan, S., Childhood predictors of adult obesity: a systematic review (1999) Int J Obes, 23, pp. S1-107; Tremblay, L., Rinaldi, C.M., The prediction of preschool children's weight from family environment factors: gender-linked differences (2010) Eat Behav, 11, pp. 266-75; Steur, M., Smit, H.A., Schipper, C.M.A., Predicting the risk of newborn children to become overweight later in childhood: the PIAMA birth cohort study (2011) Int J Pediatr Obes, 6, pp. E170-8; Braddon, F.E.M., Rodgers, B., Wadsworth, M.E.J., Onset of obesity in a 36-year birth cohort study (1986) BMJ, 293, pp. 299-303; O'Callaghan, M.J., Williams, G.M., Andersen, M.J., Prediction of obesity in children at 5 years: a cohort study (1997) J Paediatr Child Health, 33, pp. 311-16; (2013), http://www.noo.org.uk/uploads/doc/vid_17925_AdultWeightFactsheetFeb2013.pdf, National Obesity Observatory.

Impediments to foresight best practices are also discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on the literature, including both primary and secondary sources. Canada serves as a case study to discuss foresight practices. Findings: Foresight has the potential to be useful from a governance perspective. Foresight practices, however, are limited by the need to overcome departmental boundaries, political impediments and, arguably, governments' abating policy capacity. Research limitations/implications: The purpose of this article is to introduce foresight limiting to an extent the depth of the analysis. Canada is neither a foresight leader nor at the bottom of the list. Conclusions drawn from this case are, despite differing political and administrative contexts, representative of problems faced by many governments in using foresight. Originality/value: The field of public management has paid little attention to foresight, though governments do make use of this instrument. This article is one of the first to consider foresight, not from the perspective of the futures field, but from that of the discipline of public management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Foresight; Futures; Public policy; Strategic management",,,,,,"Aligica, P.D., Scenarios and the growth of knowledge: Notes on the epistemic element in scenario building (2005) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 72, pp. 815-824; Bakvis, H., Rebuilding policy capacity in the era of the fiscal dividend: A report from Canada (2000) Governance: An International Journal of Policy and Administration, 13 (1), pp. 71-103; Bakvis, H., Juillet, L., (2004) The Horizontal Challenge: Line Departments, Central Agencies and Leadership, , Canada School of Public Service, Ottawa; Beddington, J., Cooper, C.L., Field, J., Goswami, U., Huppert, F.A., Jenkins, R., Jones, H.S., Thomas, S.M., The mental wealth of nations (2008) Nature, 455 (7216), pp. 1057-1060; Bertrand, G., Michaelski, A., Pench, L., (1999) Scenarios Europe 2010: Five Possible Futures for Europe, , Forward Studies Unit, European Commission, Brussels; (2005) Joined-Up Government, , Bogdanor, V.

This fostered the redesigning of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy frameworks to adjust the scope and priorities of STI funding and to elaborate a new set of long-term strategic planning documents, in particular, to revise the Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight. Since S&T and broader socio-economic processes are closely interrelated, the new macroeconomic forecasting is a key building block for updating Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight; it is carried out by the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting (CMASF). The article presents interim results, namely, a set of possible scenarios of global development and their projections for Russia. The scenarios at the global level are determined by the pace and nature of the economic recovery worldwide, as well as by the opportunities and consequences of technological breakthroughs in the energy sector, which is expected to have the largest impact on development of the world economy. The energy sector transformation is encouraged by new technological solutions, and these can translate into large-scale market transformation with huge economic effect. The content of scenarios at the national level depends on the adaptation of the economy to the changing context of the world markets. Adaptation, in turn, determines the patterns of managing resource rents and foreign investment, as well as positioning in growing markets. The ""inflation technological breakthrough"" scenario presupposes the availability of abundant savings worldwide, whose targeted investment could result in the next technological breakthrough. It will help integrate Russia into global production chains. If the ""boom"" on financial markets does result in technological breakthrough, however, the world will be subjected to high inflation, and the high oil prices will spark the development of non-traditional hydrocarbon fuels (""energy inflation"" scenario). There are two options for Russia in this case, each of which has its pros and cons. The first presumes recapitalizing traditional assets. The second relies on building competitive advantage through the development of public-private partnerships, attracting direct portfolio investment, updating scale production and reforming institutions. Finally, if a recovery from the global crisis is protracted, the best ""recipe"" is ""creative destruction"" - eliminating the outdated and inefficient industries while creating opportunities for the development of more advantageous companies that will provide a qualitatively new basis for growth.","Economic growth; Foreign direct investment; Global crisis; Global scenarios; Long-term forecast; Macroeconomic forecast; Scenarios for Russia; World market",,,,,,"Heilig, G.K., Gerland, P., Andreev, K., Li, N., Gu, D., Spoorenberg, T., Ravinuthala, S., Koshy, N., (2010) World Population Prospects (Revision 2010), , United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Population Division; Dynkin, A., (2011) Strategicheskii Global'nyi Prognoz 2030.

By global expert system (GES) we mean all knowledge sources, bases, repositories, and processing units, regardless of whether they are human, artificial, animal, or hybrid, such that the relation ""able to transfer knowledge on immediate demand"" forms a connected graph over the elements of the system. A key requirement is that problem solving using GES is an anytime process with respect to the number of information sources taken into account. We conjecture that due to the high and ever-growing level of interconnection of knowledge units, a universal intelligence emerges, which under specific conditions can outperform the intelligence and creativity of any of its individual elements, including humans. It will be shown that this is possible only if an appropriate level of credibility can be assigned to each element of the system, which ensures that users trust the responses. We will design a hybrid supervised-reinforced learning scheme that makes it possible to achieve a satisfactory level of trust in GES query responses. Query processing will apply knowledge fusion methods such as combinations of recommendations and forecasts. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","big data; foresight; Global expert systems; semi-supervised learning; trust management; universal intelligence","Big datum; foresight; Semi-supervised learning; Trust management; universal intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Expert systems; Soft computing; Supervised learning; Information management",,,,,"Ashton, A.H., Ashton, R.H., Aggregating subjective forecasts: Some empirical results (1985) Management Science, 31, pp. 1499-1508; Bates, I.J.M., Granger, C.W.J., The combination of forecasts (1969) Operational Research Quarterly, 20, pp. 451-468; Dean, T.L., Boddy, M., An analysis of time-dependent planning (1988) Proceedings of the Seventh National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 1998, St. Paul, MN, pp. 49-54; Elliott, G., Timmermann, A., Optimal forecast combinations under general loss functions and forecast error distributions (2004) Journal of Econometrics, 122, pp. 47-79; Gligor, V., Wing, J.M., Towards a Theory of Trust in Networks of Humans and Computers (2011) LNCS, 7114, pp. 223-242. , Christianson, B., Crispo, B., Malcolm, J., Stajano, F.

Lessons may be learnt from the molecular mechanisms underpinning transient chondrocyte differentiation and function, and their application may better identify disease aetiology. Here, we review the current evidence supporting this possibility. We firstly outline endochondral ossification and the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which it is controlled in the postnatal growth plate. We then compare the biology of these transient cartilaginous structures to the inherently stable articular cartilage. Finally, we highlight specific scenarios in which the redeployment of these embryonic processes may contribute to disease development, with the foresight that deciphering those mechanisms regulating pathological changes and loss of cartilage stability will aid future research into effective disease-modifying therapies. © 2013 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.","Bone; Cartilage; Chondrocyte; Endochondral ossification; Osteoarthritis","aggrecan; cadherin; collagen type 2; collagenase 3; parathyroid hormone; vasculotropin; articular cartilage; bone; bone development; bone maturation; calcification; cartilage; cartilage cell; cartilage matrix; disease course; embryo development; enchondral ossification; epigenetics; extracellular matrix; growth plate; heterotopic ossification; human; intervertebral disk disease; morphogenesis; nonhuman; ossification; osteoarthritis; osteosclerosis; postnatal growth; priority journal; review; Wnt signaling pathway; bone; cartilage; chondrocyte; endochondral ossification; osteoarthritis; Bone Development; Bone Diseases; Cartilage; Cartilage, Articular; Cell Differentiation; Chondrocytes; Epiphyses; Growth Plate; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Ossification, Heterotopic; Osteoarthritis; Osteogenesis; Phenotype",,"collagenase 3, 175449-82-8; parathyroid hormone, 12584-96-2, 68893-82-3, 9002-64-6; vasculotropin, 127464-60-2",,,"Abad, V., Meyers, J.L., Weise, M., Gafni, R.I., Barnes, K.M., Nilsson, O., Bacher, J.D., Baron, J., The role of the resting zone in growth plate chondrogenesis (2002) Endocrinology, 143, pp. 1851-1857. , (doi:10.1210/en. 143.5.1851); Adams, C.S., Shapiro, I.M., The fate of the terminally differentiated chondrocyte: evidence for microenvironmental regulation of chondrocyte apoptosis (2002) Critical Reviews in Oral Biology and Medicine, 13, pp. 465-473. , (doi:10.1177/154411130201300604); Ahmed, S.F., Farquharson, C., The effect of GH and IGF1 on linear growth and skeletal development and their modulation by SOCS proteins (2010) Journal of Endocrinology, 206, pp. 249-259. , (doi:10.1677/ JOE-10-0045); Aigner, T., Reichenberger, E., Bertling, W., Kirsch, T., Stoss, H., von der Mark, K., Type X collagen expression in osteoarthritic and rheumatoid articular cartilage (1993) Virchows Archiv.

In addition, climate change might become an important factor in the years to come, and its associated effects might affect coastal areas. To cope with this situation the need to adopt an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) approach has been internationally recognised during the last decades. Nonetheless to be able to plan and manage coastal areas in the long-term while facing all the challenges that lie ahead, it is necessary to develop new tools that not only put into practice the ICZM principles but also incorporate and deal with the uncertainties that surround the future. In this paper, we present Participative Future Scenarios (PFS) as a tool to support decision-making in coastal areas under the ICZM principles. PFS allow exploring how coastal areas could develop in the future, using an integrative approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methods, taking into consideration coastal hazards and climate change, as well as human interaction, as the process is based on participatory techniques involving local stakeholders. The process carried out to implement PFS at the local scale has been pilot-tested in the Andalusian coastal municipality of Ayamonte, South Western Spain. Four well-differentiated scenarios showing alternative and plausible futures for the study site for the year 2050 were obtained. The result of this pioneer exercise points out that PFS are a powerful and ground-breaking tool for ICZM with a double potential: i) The generation of PFS is a valuable exercise per se as it provides an opportunity to promote participation, understand public's different opinions, facilitate communication between stakeholders and increase public awareness about coastal future problems (e.g. coastal hazards). ii) PFS can be-and should be-used as part of the decision making process for coastal planning, allowing policies to be designed in a more robust manner, accounting for critical uncertainties-as diverse as economic fluctuations or climate change- and helping to select the path to the most desirable future. Additionally, the PFS process proposed in this paper is a transferable technique that can be easily replicated in other coastal areas. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.","Andalusia; Ayamonte; Climate change; Coastal planning; Foresight; Stakeholders","anthropogenic effect; coastal zone management; decision making; hazard assessment; hazard management; industrial development; participatory approach; stakeholder; uncertainty analysis; Spain",,,,,"Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: An overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9, pp. 5-25; Boski, T., Moura, D., Veiga-Pires, C., Camacho, S., Duarte, D., Scott, D.B., Fernandes, S.G., Postglacial sea-level rise and sedimentary response in the guadiana estuary, Portugal/Spain border (2002) Sedimentary Geology, 150, pp. 103-122; Bryman, A., (2008) Social Research Methods, 800p. , New York: Oxford University Press; Buddemeier, R.W., Smith, S.V., Swaaney, D.P., Crossland, C.J., (2002) The Role of the Coastal Ocean in the Disturbed and Undisturbed Nutrient and Carbon Cycles., 55p. , Geesthacht, Germany: LOICZ; Bürgi, M., Hersperger, A.M., Schneeberger, N., Driving forces of landscape change - Current and new directions (2004) Landscape Ecology, 19, pp. 857-868; Carrero, R., Navas, F., Malvárez, G., Cáceres, F., Aplicabilidad de las TIG en la generación de escenarios de futuro para una gestión integrada de las zonas costeras (2010) Tecnologías de la Información Geográfica: La Información Geográfica Al Servicio de Los Ciudadanos, 1413p. , Sevilla, Spain: Sevilla University Publications Secretariat; Integrated coastal area management and agriculture, forestry and fisheries (1998) FAO Guidelines.

Design/methodology/approach: The workshops used the ""six pillars"" approach to foresight. The methods used included: The futures triangle, emerging issues analysis, the futures wheel, The Sarkar game and macrohistory, causal layered analysis, the integrated scenario method, visioning and backcasting. The workshop was held over three days in Rajendrapur, Bangladesh. Findings: Three visions were developed: ""Advancing knowledge with a human face"" - a future that integrates liberal arts and real world specialization; ""BRAC to the future - an eco-system of leaders"" - a future where the university becomes a social laboratory of innovation; and, ""BUG - BRAC University Global,"" - a global future where the university leverages BRAC's mission to save and serve the world. Research limitations/implications: The visions are considered complementary and are being used to develop the university's strategic plan and new campus design. Practical implications: This model of foresight provides a practical model for engaging in planning the long-term future especially when there are a diversity of interests and stakeholders. The workshop has led to real world changes in strategy and funding. Social implications: This model of foresight provides a practical model for engaging in planning the long-term future especially when there is a diversity of interests and stakeholders.

These changes in available parallelism have motivated work on adaptive concurrency control mechanisms. Existing adaptation techniques mostly learn about available parallelism indirectly, through runtime monitors that detect pathologies (e.g. excessive retries in speculation or high lock contention in mutual exclusion). We present a novel approach to adaptive parallelization, whereby the effective level of parallelism is predicted directly based on input features, rather than through circumstantial indicators over the execution environment (such as retry rate). This enables adaptation with foresight, based on the input data and not the run prefix. For this, the user specifies input features, which our system then correlates with the amount of available parallelism through offline learning. The resulting prediction rule serves in deployment runs to foresee the available parallelism for a given workload and tune the parallelization system accordingly. We have implemented our approach in TIGHTFIT, a general framework for input-centric offline adaptation. Our experimental evaluation of TIGHTFIT over two adaptive runtime systems and eight benchmarks provides positive evidence regarding TIGHTFIT's efficacy and accuracy.

The paper commences with a review of collective intelligence as a subject area. It then assesses water as an issue, paying particular attention to the new set of World Water Scenarios currently being undertaken by the World Water Assessment Program of UNESCO and its latest World Water Development Report (2012). It considers the application of collective intelligence systems to the challenge of water provision with particular reference to a recent initiative led by the International Water Association (IWA), the IWA WaterWiki. It examines potential future developments from a collective intelligence viewpoint. – It is increasingly recognised that the drivers that affect water provision are linked to the change drivers of other global issues. There is a need to deal with the inadequacies of currently available water data. Online collective intelligence systems make it easier to set practical goals and monitor progress and send, receive and act on the latest research and new information. Complementary collective intelligence systems in other areas are needed. – The paper deals with current developments in the water sector.

The first phase of water injection has just begun in a small part of Burgan as a precursor to peripheral step-in water injection in the topmost Wara reservoir. Tertiary recovery schemes are being evaluated early in the life of this field with the foresight of reaping maximum benefits through early application before waterflood approaches maturity. Low salinity water (LSW) injection has been identified as a forerunner and apart from being very promising in itself; it will form an important base for the application of polymers and/or Alkaline/polymer/surfactant EOR schemes. Burgan is large enough to have a diversity that will require distinctive solutions for different areas of the field and different reservoir zones. Produced water injection started in Wara formation in 2010 at 60mbwpd with next phase of 670mbwd injection arriving in 2014 to implement peripheral injection in the flanks. This is targeting just 5% of the reserves that will need future water injection. Confidence in the LSW trial will therefore change the course of our future water injection schemes in the remaining zones. Replacing secondary with tertiary recovery schemes early will benefit not just the operating costs of the volume of water handling and disposal/injection; the overall recoveries will be higher. The eyes of the world are constantly on the health of the 2 super giants, Burgan and Ghawar. Potential benefits from EOR will have a huge impact on the extension to the life of Burgan and its strategic importance worldwide. This is the first time that KOC has taken a bold step into the field without extensive laboratory screening. As a result of taking this carefully calculated risk, KOC have soared ahead in experience on EOR in the Greater Burgan Field, within a small timeframe. The presentation will discuss the results of the LSW trial injection into 2 producers and comparisons on Sorw are made of LSW versus High Salinity produced water injection. Key learnings are shared from operating the pilot and modeling of the results. Single well tracers were used to measure the Sorw and its interpretations can be quite challenging. The tests have been analysed using five different methods. From this work, it was concluded that • Low salinity water injection reduced Sorw by at least 3 s.u. (23.7% of remaining oil after effluent waterflood) in the best quality rock with the least clay content in Burgan, which would still be sufficient to make it economically attractive. • Additional tests are planned for the remaining rock types in Burgan, having higher clay content and the potential for a larger change in oil saturation. • Multiple models for evaluating the tracers response provide better insights to the interpretation of the Sorw. • Good surveillance during the test and careful control on injection/production volumes are essential when a small response in Sorw is expected. To reduce uncertainty in the results, it is preferable to use downhole pumps rather than gas lift, control the temperature of injected water and invest in lengthy overflushing back to base brine after LSW injection.

The paper also aims to deepen consideration of the potential for ""overshoot and collapse"" futures and related concerns by foresight practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on, and presents, a thematic analytical literature review. Findings: In total, four underlying drivers of increased reframing and four central themes in positive reframes are identified; mental ""frames"" informing and limiting foresight work need to be openly communicated and reflected on - such practitioner reflexivity is often missing in foresight work, such as in The Biggest Wake-up Call in History by Richard Slaughter. Practical implications: The paper includes discussion of the implications for futures practice, including the role of mental frames and reframing. The author suggests futures practitioners can play important new roles in challenging the recent re-emergence of influential forms of environmental determinism and foresight practitioners need to be more wary of the potential for ""narrative bias"". Social implications: Futures assessment is increasingly needed to guide policy and action in improving human-environment relations. Barriers and opportunities to fulfilling this societal need must be understood. Originality/value: The paper helps to deepen the consideration of ""re-framing"" and environmental limits by foresight practitioners and theorists. In doing so, the paper also brings in new concepts from other fields (such as cognitive psychology and Science and Technology Studies) into the foresight/futures field. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental limits; Environmental management; Frames; Reframing; Social change; Social policy; Sustainability",,,,,,"Biermann, F., Planetary boundaries and earth system governance: Exploring the links (2012) Ecological Economics, 81, pp. 4-9; (2012) Environment and Development Challenges: The Imperative to Act, , Asahi Glass Foundation, Tokyo, Laureates Blue Planet Prize; Brand, S., (2009) Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto, , Viking, New York, NY; Brown, V.A., Harris, J.A., Russell, J.Y., (2010) Tackling Wicked Problems through the Transdisciplinary Imagination, , (Eds), Earthscan, London; Burns, T.R., The Sustainability revolution: A societal paradigm shift (2012) Sustainability, 4, pp. 1118-1134; Charlton, A., (2011) Quarterly Essay 44: Man-Made World: Choosing between Progress and Planet, , Black Inc., Melbourne; Dator, J., Response to the Marien-Halal debate (2011) Journal of Futures Studies, 16 (2), pp. 105-106; DeFries, R.S., Ellis, E.C., Chapin III, F.S., Matson, P.A., Turner II, B.L., Agrawal, A., Crutzen, P.J., Syvitski, J., Planetary opportunities: A social contract for global change science to contribute to a sustainable future (2012) BioScience, 62 (6), pp. 603-606; Donlan, J., Mandel, J., Wilcox, C., Why environmentalism needs high finance (2009) SEED Magazine, , http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/why_envronmentalism_needs_high_finance/, accessed February 21, 2011, available at, April 22; Dryzek, J.S., (2005) The Politics of the Earth: Environmental Discourses, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 2nd ed; Eades, G.L., Determining environmental determinism (2012) Progress in Human Geography, 36 (3), pp. 423-427; Ehrlich, P., Ehrlich, A., The population bomb revisited (2009) The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development, 1 (3), pp. 5-13; Ellis, E., The planet of no return: Human resilience on an artificial earth (2011) Breakthrough Journal, (2). , http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/journal/past-issues/issue-2/the-planet-of-no-return/, accessed December 9, 2012, available at; Ellis, E., (2012) Environments are not constraints, , www.thisisafricaonline.com/Comment/Environments-are-not-constraints?ct=true, accessed December 9, 2012, available at; Ellis, E., Paradigm of no return (2012) Breakthrough Journal, , http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/journal/debates/planet-of-no-return-a-breakthrough-debate/paradigm-of-no-return/, available at, March; Ellis, E., Haff, P.K., Earth science in the anthropocene: New epoch, new paradigm, new responsibilities (2009) Eos Transactions, 90 (49), p. 473; Ellyard, P., (2009) Designing 2050: Pathways to Sustainable Prosperity on Spaceship Earth, , TPN TXT, Yarraville, Australia; Flannery, T., (2010) Here on Earth: An Argument for Hope, , Text Publishing, Melbourne; (2006) Interview of Dr Graeme Pearman by Janine Cohen, , www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2006/s1566290.htm, February 14, available at, (accessed 23 December 2012), Corners Four; Foxon, T.J., A coevolutionary framework for analysing a transition to a sustainable low carbon economy (2011) Ecological Economics, 70 (11), pp. 2258-2267; Giddens, A., (2011) The Politics of Climate Change, , Polity, Cambridge, 2nd ed; Gordon, A., (2009) Future Savvy: Identifying Trends to Make Better Decisions, , American Management Association, New York, NY; Guterl, F., (2012) The Fate of the Species: Why the Human Race May Cause Its Own Extinction and How We Can Stop It, , Bloomsbury, New York, NY; Homer-Dixon, T., (2011) 13th Civilization far from Equilibrium: Energy, Complexity and Human Survival, , paper presented at the Equinox Summit - Energy 2030; Hulme, M., (2009) Why We Disagree about Climate Change: Understanding Controversy, Inaction Opportunity, , Cambridge University Press; Hulme, M., Learning to live with recreated climates (2010) Nature and Culture, 5 (2), pp. 117-122; Hulme, M., Reducing the future to climate: A story of climate determinism and reductionism (2011) Osiris, 26 (1), pp. 245-266; Hulme, M., (2012) What sorts of knowledge for what sort of politics?

Clients, however, may need to execute a sequence of operations (a composite operation) atomically. We consider the problem of extending a linearizable library to support arbitrary atomic composite operations by clients. We introduce a novel approach in which the concurrent library ensures atomicity of composite operations by exploiting information (foresight) provided by its clients. We use a correctness condition, based on a notion of dynamic right-movers, that guarantees that composite operations execute atomi-cally without deadlocks, and without using rollbacks. We present a static analysis to infer the foresight information required by our approach, allowing a compiler to automatically insert the foresight information into the client. This relieves the client programmer of this burden and simplifies writing client code. We present a generic technique for extending the library implementation to realize foresight-based synchronization. This technique is used to implement a general-purpose Java library for Map data structures - the library permits composite operations to simultaneously work with multiple instances of Map data structures. We use the Maps library and the static analysis to enforce atomicity of a wide selection of real-life Java composite operations. Our experiments indicate that our approach enables realizing efficient and scalable synchronization for real-life composite operations.

Findings: The author's view is that, overall, these contributions to the special issue of OTH more than fulfil the goal of commenting on and, in some cases, extending the core concerns of BWCH. Originality/value: If the BWCH and the papers presented in this special issue can play even a small part in the process of waking up and taking responsibility then people can all breathe a little easier.

Futurists have a process, methods and skills to submit to a positive advancement of these challenges, which is the purpose of this paper. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is the author's synthesis and reflection of the more positive aspects of addressing the problems facing contemporary society. Findings: The author concludes the visioning operation needs to be near the beginning of the future's practice with the focus on presencing ""what does the future want from us in this matter?"" How can people serve ""it"" instead of their ego? This will take maturity, being conscious, and having an attitude of gratitude and service to something bigger than ourselves. Originality/value: When futurist practitioners practice the approach of foresight planning, the viewpoint examined here is that the vision exercise should be placed at the beginning of the process. The priority of the visioning activity should include an inquiry of what wants to emerge from the ""evolutionary integral future."" This consideration widens the perspective to include the well-being of the whole ecosystem, with the possible benefits of resilience, waking up, growing up, and showing up. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Changing society; Ecosystems; Integral; Integral futures; Pronoia; Rational spirituality; Resilience; Society; Strategic planning; The Biggest Wake-up Call in History; Theory U; Visioning",,,,,,"Alegria, R., The appreciative perspective of the future (2005) Journal of Futures Studies, 10 (1), pp. 101-108; Bach, R., (1998) Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah, , Dell Publishing, New York, NY; Borysenko, J., (2009) It's Not the End of the World: How to Develop Resilience in Times of Change, , Hay House, Carlsbad, CA; Borysenko, J., (2012) Tending to the soul of health, , www.theenlightenmentconference.com, available at (accessed August 2012); Brezsny, R., (2005) Pronoia Is the Antidote for Paranoia: How the Whole World Is Conspiring to Shower You with Blessings, , Frog Books, Berkeley, CA; Carson, R., (2002) Silent Spring, , (first published 1962), Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA; Esbjörn-Hargens, S., (2009) An Overview of Integral Theory: A Content-Free Framework for the 21st Century, pp. 1-24. , Resource Paper No. 1, Integral Institute, Louisville, CO; Lewis, M.M., http://rationalspirituality.com/articles/KW.htm, available at (accessed November 2012), n.d; McIntosh, M., (2012) Evolution and enlightenment, , www.theenlightenmentconference.com, available at (accessed August 2012); Markley, O., Manifesting upside recovery instead of downside fear: Five ways megacrisis anticipation can proactively improve futures research and social policy (2011) Journal of Futures Studies, 16 (2), pp. 123-134; Ogilvy, J., Facing the fold: From the eclipse of Utopia to the restoration of hope (2011) Foresight, 13 (4), pp. 7-23; Phipps, C., Huston, T., (2012) Evolutionaries, , www.theenlightenmentconference.com, available at (accessed August 2012); Scharmer, O.C., (2009) Theory U: Leading from the Future as It Emerges, , Berrett-Koehler, San Francisco, CA; Slaughter, R.A., (2010) The Biggest Wake-up Call in History, , Foresight International, Indooroopilly; Zolli, A., Healy, A.M., (2012) Resilience: Why Things Bounce Back, , Free Press, New York, NY; Kelly, D., (2012) Mondo Zen: Waking up, growing up and showing up!, , www.theenlightenmentconference.com, available at (accessed August 2012); Markley, O., Research and action toward the upside of down (2011) Journal of Futures Studies, 15 (3), pp. 145-174; Seligman, M.P., Building resilience (2011) Harvard Business Review, 89 (4), pp. 100-106; Wilber, K., (2012) Enlightenment means waking up and growing up, , www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTdrRgE4uAQ, online teleseminar, available at, n.d (accessed October)","Collins, T.; College of Technology, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; email: IntegralFutures@aol.com",,,,,,,,10748121,,,,"English","Horizon",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883107158

The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of the primary energy resource context in making sense of the prospects for such futures, and to consider how subtle changes to conceptual models for understanding the nature of human development can offer alternate pathways for proceeding in light of the fundamental limits this imposes. Design/methodology/approach: Conceptual models for the relationship between energy and social complexity are reviewed, and proposals for connecting social complexity with interior human development are discussed. Popular models of interior human development are critiqued in light of recent clarifications relating to Integral Theory; and specific reconceptualisations are proposed. Findings: Technological and interior human development are intimately linked. There are important interdependencies between energy and social complexity that must be taken into account in establishing expectations for the way that these realms might evolve together. This presents significant challenges for realising on a society-wide scale development of the nature commonly associated with Integral Theory. However, alternative ways of conceptualising such development offer fresh opportunities for confronting the spectre of environmental and social breakdown. Originality/value: The implications of models relating social complexity and resource context are extended to questions of human interior development; the unit of development is extended from the individual in relative isolation to the organism-in-environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Descent; Economic sustainability; Energy; Energy resources; Integral foresight; Interior development; Resource management; Social complexity",,,,,,"Diamond, J., (2005) Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail Or Survive, , Allen Lane, Camberwell; Fischer, K.W., Hand, H.H., Russell, S., The development of abstractions in adolescence and adulthood (1984) Beyond Formal Operations: Late Adolescent and Adult Cognitive Development, pp. 43-73. , Commons, M.L., Richards, F.A., Armon, C.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews metaphors of awakening in Slaughter's The Biggest Wake-up Call in History, the Great Transition Initiative, Gilding's The Great Disruption and Inayatullah's ""Waking up to a new future"". It identifies seven characteristics of awakening and uses these to create an environmental scanning framework. It reports on a preliminary application of the framework and proposes a future research agenda. Findings: The paper identifies seven signals of awakening: futures literacy, shifting values, activism, collective agency, engaged dialogue, distributed leadership and inspiring visions. While evidence for most of these signals can be found, it is often weak and dominated by other trends. Research limitations/implications: The environmental scanning framework needs to be expanded using additional literature and testing. The question of when confrontation with apocalyptic future images can deliver positive outcomes remains unresolved. Practical implications: Perhaps the single most important thing that could be done to help rouse sleeping humanity is to begin to make connections between the diverse movements identified in the paper and to see them as pieces of the larger puzzle of how we wake up. Maybe an ""awakening movement"" could provide a common goal in the twenty-first century. Originality/value: The paper is an original exploration of the metaphor of awakening in four prominent works on sustainable futures.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a comparative analysis of future-oriented literature. The paper applies the ""Limits to Growth"" thinking and suggests an approach where the concept of material and population growth is questioned. Findings: Multidisciplinary examination of research literature reveals what is normally considered to be problems such as energy, food and water scarcity, poverty and environmental degradation really are not problems but symptoms; the problem is the continuing economic and population growth on a finite planet. Migration has always been a possible coping strategy for people facing economic and political problems as well as environmental changes. Continuing growth has not erased poverty and closed the gap between the rich and poor, which is a major driving force of migration. Only changing the structure of the system will do that. Practical implications: The present unsustainable way of life means that society risks a multitude of crises. Many breakdowns will most likely be happening simultaneously throughout the entire environmental and socioeconomic system on a worldwide scale. Humanity has set the scene for the overshoot scenario and reversal of growth will be necessary to get out of it. New kinds of methods are needed to respond to the current challenges. It is imperative to reinvent economic theories and create new monetary and fiscal policies to solve the multidimensional ecological, economic, demographic, political and social crises humanity is facing today. Originality/value: In a world where the lack of foresight exists to an alarming degree at every level of society, it is important to be constantly reminded of the imminent global crises resulting from growth. It is becoming apparent that fragmented strategies cannot address the pressing challenges. New values are needed to guide society to peaceful and equitable development in an increasingly interconnected world.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies the author's research on long-term patterns in individual values changes. It takes a developmental perspective, suggesting a consistent direction of change in individual values, drawing on an analysis of 20 values systems described in the literature. Findings: The findings suggest that the long-term values changes offer both hope and concern for addressing the global emergency. The hope comes from development in postmodern and integral values, suggesting that the rise of postmodern values could lead to greater awareness of the global emergency and that the rise of integral values in particular could lead to greater action in addressing it. A concern is that modern values suggest priorities reinforcing the trends and developments, such as a massive rise in consumption, driving the global emergency and that these values are increasingly prevalent in the emerging markets that make up the largest share of the global population. Research limitations/implications: The most important area for further research would be to develop an accurate measure of the prevalence of the types of values present in the world today. Social implications: The impacts on society suggest important timing questions for addressing the global emergency. The growing presence of modern values reinforces the trends driving the emergency, while the rise of postmodern and integral values suggests potential for moving toward solutions. It is not clear which set of values will end up having the greater impact: modern values could intensify the emergency before postmodern and integral values are sufficiently developed to drive solutions. Originality/value: The synthesis of research on long-term pattern in values shifts and its application to global emergency discussion adds an element of richness to the discussion of the role of interior aspects of the integral perspective. Futurists and others concerned with the global emergency will have greater insight into the need to deal with the spread of modern values in the emerging markets, as well as greater insight into the need to cultivate the spread of postmodern and integral values and enlist the support of those having those values in working on solutions to the global emergency. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumerism; Foresight; Global emergency; Individual behaviour; Integral; Modern history; Postmodernism; Social values; Values",,,,,,"Beck, D., Cowan, C., (1996) Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership, and Change, , Blackwell, Malden, MA; Bishop, P., Hines, A., (2012) Teaching about the Future: The Basics of Foresight, , Palgrave Macmillan, Houndmills; Coates, J., Mahaffie, J., Hines, A., (1997) 2025: Scenarios of US and Global Society Reshaped by Science and Technology, , Oak Hill, Akron, OH; Crompton, T., (2010) Common Cause: The Case for Working with Our Cultural Values, , http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/common_cause_report.pdf, available at, (accessed March 28, 2013); Graves, C., Human nature prepares for a momentous leap (1974) The Futurist, pp. 72-87; Greer, J.M., (2008) Cultural conservers, , http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2008/05/cultural-conservers.html, The Archdruid Report (Blog), available at, (accessed March 21, 2013); Gunderson, L., Holling, C.S., (2002) Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, , Island Press, Washington DC; Hawken, P., (2008) Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Social Movement in History Is Restoring Grace, Justice, and Beauty to the World, , Penguin, New York, NY; Hines, A., Hitting the snooze button on the future: Review of The Biggest Wake up Call in History (2011) Foresight, 13 (2); Hines, A., (2011) ConsumerShift: How Changing Values Are Reshaping the Consumer Landscape, , No Limit Publishing, Tucson, AZ; Hines, A., (2011) Global Trends: Drivers, Values, Implications, and Strategic Questions for Credit Unions, , Filene Research Institute, Madison, WI; Hines, A., (2011); Inglehart, R., (1997) Modernization and Postmodernization: Cultural, Economic, and Political Change in 43 Societies, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Inglehart, R., Baker, W., Modernization, cultural change, and the persistence of traditional values (2000) American Sociological Review, 65, pp. 19-51; Inglehart, R., Mapping global values (2006) Comparative Sociology, 5 (2-3), pp. 115-136; Inglehart, R., Welzel, C., Development and democracy: What we know about modernization today (2009) Foreign Affairs, pp. 33-41. , March/April; Inglehart, R., Welzel, C., Changing mass priorities: The link between modernization and democracy (2010) Perspectives on Politics, 8 (2), pp. 551-567; Lyotard, J., (1979) Introduction: The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, , University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, MN; Markley, O., Imaginal visioning for prophetic foresight (2012) Journal of Futures Studies, 17 (1), pp. 5-24; Values under stress (2012) Deepening Economic Doubts in India, , Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project, Center Pew Research; Ray, P., (2000) The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World, , Harmony Books, New York, NY; Ray, P., (2008) The Cultural Creatives.

To move the field into more fertile pastures for research, we draw on the practice theoretical lens to provide an alternative viewpoint on strategic foresight as a bundle of everyday organizing practices. In keeping with the practice approach to strategic foresight, we delineate strategic foresight as a continuous and contextual practice of 'wayfinding', that manifest in everyday situated organizing.

It is a living network of stakeholders of different types that is working on personal and on-line future shaping activities and feedbacks among stakeholders. This concept is realized in a futures case study about the futures of SMEs in the Central Hungarian Region (CHR). Its first results show that the level of future orientation of participative entrepreneurs is moderate, they do not think that the innovation is a wonder weapon in the aspect of getting beyond the economic crisis or business success, but they do think that business exploitation of qualification of human factor is more important than the innovation for shaping the future knowledge economy of CHR.As our interactive foresight process represents a new social technology that is still under development, so we want to disseminate our results and to operate our research homepage continuously.

Futurium was initially developed with the primary purpose of hosting and curating visions and policy ideas generated by Digital Futures (Digital Futures was launched in July 2011 by DG CONNECT's Director General Robert Madelin following a prior DG CONNECT exercise called Digital Science.). However, it has turned into a platform on which to experiment with new policymaking models based on scientific evidence and stakeholder participation, referred to in this paper as 'Policy Making 3.0'. The platform hosts an online foresight toolkit to facilitate the joint creation of ideas to help design future policies. It leverages the potential of social networks, open data, semantic and knowledge mining technologies as well as participatory brainstorming techniques to engage stakeholders and harness their views and creativity to better inform policies that matter to them. The Futurium distinguishes between different variables, reflecting the emotional vs. rational mindsets of the participants, and offers the possibility to frame the engagement and co-creation process into multiple phases of a workflow. Futurium was developed to support Digital Futures, but its open architecture makes it easily adaptable to any policymaking/decision-making context where thinking ahead, participation, scientific evidence and agility are needed. Futurium is an early prototype implementation of the Policy Making 3.0 model, which is a long-term vision requiring further investigation and experimentation.

After a brief reminder of the context in which the exercise was begun, the authors outline the approach followed (choice and prioritization of structural variables, construction of microand macro-scenarios). They go on to analyse the participatory and partnership aspects of this approach: relations with the steering committee, shared construction of scenarios, and profiles of the participants. Lastly, they present the findings derived from it through the five scenarios for the future of the Languedoc-Roussillon coastal area to 2050 and the learning-processes and impact of the approach on the participants, as evaluated in a survey of the actors involved carried out after the event, a survey whose findings attest to the highly positive perception of this collaborative foresight approach and of the dynamics it was able to contribute to developing among a certain number of them.",,,,,,,"Bouyer, C., (2004) Construire Ensemble un Développement Équilibré du Littoral, , Paris: La documentation Française; Rey-Valette, H., Lafon, X., La gestion intégrée des zones côtières: Construction nécessaire de nouveaux référentiels pour la gestion du littoral?

It led in 1979 to the publication of an almost 500-page report on the future of the world (economy, societies, North-South relations, interdependence etc.) as it might be anticipated at the time. This exercise, which was carried out under the leadership of Jacques Lesourne and dubbed the Interfutures study, was an international landmark in the history of foresight studies. This was partly because of its ambitious nature and partly on account of its determinedly qualitative stance, being based on scenariobuilding and recommendations for political action. Bruno Hérault goes back over the history of Interfutures here -the context in which it was developed, the organization of the study and the tenor of the report it produced (in particular, the scenarios proposed and the recommendations to those in government). He goes on to show how the programme turned out to be quite clear-sighted about the development of societies and globalization, which was only just emerging at the time. He concludes by highlighting the strengths and limitations of the method employed.",,,,,,,"Albert, M., Interfuturs vingt ans après (2000) Décision, Prospective, Autoorganisation.

Until very recently, the approaches used in these studies have remained relatively unchanged. However, the global forest sector has been faced with major structural changes and its operating environment has become ever more complex and interlinked with other sectors. The aim of this article is to review the forest sector outlook approaches in face of these changes, and to analyze how well they have been able to capture and project the changes. Moreover, we raise the question of whether they seem informative enough for the purposes of today's decision makers and other stakeholders. The results indicate that the existing outlook studies have not been able to sufficiently capture the structural changes in global paper markets, and it may be that they have difficulties in considering the possible structural changes in other markets as well. In order to assess the changes occurring in the operating environment more systematically, and to better meet the needs of policy-makers and stakeholders, there are potential advantages in complementing the current modeling approach dominant in the forest sector with other methods from the field of foresight. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Foresight; Forest products markets; Modeling; Outlook; Paper products; Structural change","Current modeling; Decision makers; Foresight; Forest products; Global paper market; Operating environment; Outlook; Structural change; Commerce; Models; Paper products; Forestry; Commerce; Forestry; Marketing; Models; Paper Products",,,,,"Adams, D.M., Haynes, R.W., The 1980 softwood timber assessment market model: structure, projections, and policy simulations (1980) Forest Science, 26 (3). , (a0001-z0001); Ahlroth, S., Höjer, M., Sustainable energy prices and growth: comparing macroeconomic and backcasting scenarios (2007) Ecological Economics, 63 (4), pp. 722-731; Aligica, P.D., A critical realist image of the future.

The common meaning of the word ""waste"" is replaced with the term ""potential mineral resource"" and most recently as ""secondary resource"". This reflects both usage properties and potential benefits. Basing on statistical data (the end of 2011) the amount of waste produced by the economic sector in Poland is nearly 123,5 mil Mg. In this, hard coal mining waste constitute about 28 mil Mg, meaning nearly 23%. Additionally, it is estimated that nearly 480 mil Mg of such waste is deposited in the environment. The result of the data analysis is that around 80% of waste produced during exploitation and processing of minerals is - in order to avoid fees for dumping - used in economy. Only 30% of this is industrially used and almost 70% is applied in ground levelling, engineering works or in so called ""ground constructions"". This way the abundance of potential mineral is irretrievably lost. The basic legal act for waste management issues is the Act from 10 July 2008 on extractive waste (Dz. U. Nr 138, poz. 865) adapting to the existing Polish law Directive 2006/21/EC. The aim of this Act is to prevent production of waste in extractive industry, diminishing their negative influence on the environment and people's health. The major aim of the project ""Foresight in priority and innovative technologies of hard coal mining waste management"" is identification of leading technologies in mining waste management of primary meaning, as their development in next 20 years in Poland will be a priority as well as creating scenario of their development through applying systematized research methodology. The project is conducted by the consortium including Institute of Mechanised Construction and Rock Mining, Silesian Technical University in Gliwice and AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. The article presents current situation of hard coal mining waste management in Poland, including criteria of their economic usage. It also presents the diagnosis of current state of development in economic management of hard coal waste technologies, defines evaluation criteria of innovativeness of currently applied technological solutions, provides SWOT analysis results on institutional and technological level, scenarios for the development of innovative technologies for utilisation of hard coal mining waste and future research and development work.",,,,,,,"(2013) Główny Urza{ogonek}d Statystyczny, , Warszawa; Baic, I., Witkowska-Kita, B., Technologie zagospodarowania odpadów z górnictwa we{ogonek}gla kamiennego - diagnoza stanu aktualnego, ocena innowacyjności i analiza SWOT (2011) Rocznik Ochrona Środowiska (Annual Set The Environment Protection), 13, pp. 1315-1327; Baic, I., Wpływ wybranych czynników na rozwój innowacyjnych technologii zagospodarowania odpadów pochodza{ogonek}cych z górnictwa we{ogonek}gla kamiennego metoda{ogonek} krzyżowej analizy wpływów (2011) Rocznik Ochrona Środowiska (Annual Set The Environment Protection), 13, pp. 1339-1359; Baic, I., Foresight OGWK - Analiza innowacyjności innowacyjnych technologii zagospodarowania odpadów pochodza{ogonek}cych z górnictwa we{ogonek}gla kamiennego z zastosowaniem metody Delphi (2011) Rocznik Ochrona Środowiska (Annual Set The Environment Protection), 13, pp. 1289-1301; Kozioł, W., Zastosowanie analitycznego procesu hierarchicznego (AHP) do wielokryterialnej oceny innowacyjności technologii zagospodarowania odpadów z górnictwa we{ogonek}gla kamiennego (2011) Rocznik Ochrona Środowiska (Annual Set The Environment Protection), 13, pp. 1619-1635","Baic, I.; Instytut Mechanizacji Budownictwa i Górnictwa Skalnego, Centrum Gospodarki Odpadami i Zarzadzania Środowiskowego, Oddział Zamiejscowy IMBiGS, Katowice, Poland",,,,,,,,1506218X,,,,"English; Polish","Rocz.

Using the conceptual framework of anticipatory governance to guide the analysis, a series of strategies that PEN adopted will be described, including leveraging external expertise, developing cross-disciplinary research products, providing a future-oriented view on policy analysis, and building a brand for communications and outreach. This case study is a useful example in demonstrating the recent conceptual shift away from relying on government-led technology assessment efforts to consider the longer-term implications of new technologies toward the concept of anticipatory governance that includes a more substantive role for nongovernmental actors, that in providing forward-looking, actionable intelligence for decision makers. Considering the example of PEN also highlights the critical role that boundary-spanning organizations play in linking together disparate communities of expertise. © 2013 by The Policy Studies Organization.","Anticipatory governance; Boundary spanning; Foresight; Framing; Nanotechnology","conceptual framework; governance approach; nanotechnology; policy analysis; technological development; technology policy; United States",,,,,"Balogh, B., (1991) Chain reaction: Expert debate and public participation in American commercial nuclear power, 1945-1975, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Barben, D., Fisher, E., Selin, C., Guston, D.H., Anticipatory governance of nanotechnology: Foresight, engagement, integration (2008) The handbook of science and technology studies, pp. 979-1000. , E.

Adaptation assessments typically consider second-best worlds that incorporate the realities of market imperfections, institutional and informational constraints, delayed policy implementation, and other issues. As mitigation analyses increasingly consider the potential effectiveness of policies implemented under second-best world assumptions, it strikes us that their use of first-best and second-best benchmarks is becoming increasingly valuable. It also strikes us that adding the perspective of first-best worlds to adaptation analyses would do the same by providing comparable baselines for national and international assessments integrating the costs and benefits of adaptation and mitigation policies. In addition, adaptation analyses under first-best world assumptions could provide valuable information to policymakers on what could be achieved under ideal conditions. It would be very informative for science and policy to understand the benefits, trade-offs, human and financial resource requirements, and residual damages under first-best and second-best assumptions about the rate, extent, and timing of implementation of climate policies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,"adaptation; environmental policy; mitigation; policy implementation",,,,,"Edenhofer, O., Carraro, C., Hourcade, J.C., On the economics of decarbonization in an imperfect world (2012) Clim Change, 114, pp. 1-8; Lipsey, R.G., Lancaster, K., The general theory of second best (1956) Rev Econ Stud, 1, pp. 11-32; Bauer, N., Baumstark, L., Leimbach, M., The REMIND-R model: the role of renewables in the low-carbon transformation-first-best vs. second-best worlds (2012) Clim Change, 114, pp. 145-168; Clarke, L., Edmonds, J., Krey, V., Richels, R., Rose, S., Tavoni, M., International climate policy architectures: overview of the EMF22 international scenarios (2009) Energy Econ, 31, pp. S64-S81; Edenhofer, O., Knopf, B., Barker, T., Baumstark, L., Bellevrat, E., Chateau, B., Criqui, P., Kypreos, S., The economics of low stabilization: model comparison of mitigation strategies and costs (2010) Energy J, 31 (SI1), pp. 11-48; Luderer, G., Bosetti, V., Jakob, M., Leimbach, M., Steckel, J.C., Waisman, H., Edenhofer, O., The economics of decarbonizing the energy system-results and insights from the RECIPE model intercomparison (2012) Clim Change, 114, pp. 9-37; Anthoff, D., Tol, R.S.J., Yohe, G., Discounting for climate change (2009) Econ Open-Access Open-Assessment E-J, 24, p. 3. , http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2009-24; Stern, N., Peters, S., Bakhshi, V., Bowen, A., Cameron, C., Catovsky, S., Crane, D., Edmonson, N., (2006) Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change, , HM Treasury, London; Ebi, K.L., Hallegatte, S., Kram, T., Arnell, N.W., Carter, T.R., Edmonds, J., Kriegler, E., Zwickel, T., A new scenario framework for climate change research: background, process, and future directions (2013) Clim Change, , submitted for publication; van Vuuren, D.P., Kriegler, E., O'Neill, B.C., Ebi, K.L., Riahl, K., Carter, T.R., Edmonds, J., Winkler, H., A new scenario framework for climate change research: scenario matrix architecture (2013) Clim Change, , submitted for publication; O'Neill, B.C., Kriegler, E., Riahl, K., Ebi, K., Hallegatte, S., Carter, T.R., Mathur, R., van Vuuren, D.P., A new scenario framework for climate change research: the concept of shared socio-economic pathways (2013) Clim Change, , submitted for publication; Kriegler, E., Edmonds, J., Hallegatte, S., Ebi, K.L., Kram, T., Riahl, K., Winker, H., van Vuuren, D.P., A new scenario framework for climate change research: the concept of shared policy assumptions (2013) Clim Change, , submitted for publication; White, G.F., The choice of use in resource management (1961) Nat Resour J, 1, pp. 23-40. , Reprinted in Geography, Resources, and Environment: Vol 1.

The systems thinking diagrams may suggest entirely new emerging issues and trends that may impact the future business environment. These emergent trends signal new customer needs that other methods cannot surface. Their richness of detail gives inventors and designers an intimate view of the constraints and customer pain points that may arrive in the future. The PepsiCo research foresights initiative used inductive scenarios to inform the company's research agenda.

The future is perhaps becoming less certain, or at least uncertainty is a central feature of future trajectories. This paper discusses the role that different types of scenarios can play in helping derive potential transport futures - including issues of possibility, plausibility and desirability - giving examples of each. It then contextualises the scenarios, emphasising the need for the longer view, the importance of decarbonising the economy, and in engaging decisions makers at all levels in a fully participatory process to confront the need for strong action on mitigation and adaptation. This is illustrated with an example from Delhi to demonstrate some of the recent developments and applications of these principles. Finally, some comments are made on the issues relating to improving our understanding of sustainability, and the difficulty of making radical changes to individual and societal values, and to travel behaviours, often requiring immediate and large scale actions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Backcasting; Delhi; Foresight; Pathways; Policy packaging; Scenarios","action plan; decision making; participatory approach; transportation development; transportation policy; travel behavior; Delhi; India",,,,,"Åkerman, J., Sustainable air transport-on track in 2050 (2005) Transportation Research D, 10 (2), pp. 111-126; Åkerman, J., Höjer, M., How much transport can the climate stand?

The foresight of the founders of the laboratory has enabled the pursuit of ecological studies that have been amongst the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of reserves as a tool for conservation and restoration. The insights flowing from this work at Leigh are important, not only for targeted marine species, but also at the ecosystem level, and have proven to be highly relevant to broader resource management issues. Novel methodologies have been employed in the pursuit of these aims, helping to popularise their wider use. More recent work has focused on understanding the processes underlying the variability in response to marine conservation in marine reserves across the spectrum of coastal marine habitats in New Zealand. The LML has probably exceeded the expectations of its founders, who hoped the laboratory might generate information of interest in the fields of resource management, food web dynamics and natural fluctuations distinct from man-induced changes, and its contribution in the field of marine conservation has been significant both within New Zealand and internationally. This has been a 50-year journey that has gone from a focus on local effects of conservation to the broader context, from direct effects of protection to indirect effects, and from small-scale spatial conservation management to ecosystem-based management. © 2013 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","food webs; marine protected areas; marine reserves; resource management; trophic cascades","conservation management; food web; marine park; resource management; restoration ecology; New Zealand",,,,,"Anderson, M.J., Willis, T.J., Canonical analysis of principal coordinates: A useful method of constrained ordination for ecology (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 511-525; Andrew, N.L., Choat, J.H., Habitat related differences in the survivorship and growth of juvenile sea urchins (1985) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 27, pp. 155-161; Andrew, N.L., MacDiarmid, A.B., Interrelations between sea urchins and spiny lobsters in northeastern New Zealand (1991) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 70, pp. 211-222; Ayling, A.M., (1978) Okakari Point to Cape Rodney Marine Reserve Survey, pp. 1-98. , Leigh Marine Laboratory Bulletin 1 University of Auckland Leigh; Babcock, R.C., Egli, D.P., Attwood, C.G., Individual-based model of reef fish populations in temperate marine reserves based on acoustic telemetry and census data (2012) Environmental Conservation, 39, pp. 282-294; Babcock, R.C., Kelly, S., Shears, N.T., Walker, J.W., Willis, T.J., Changes in community structure in temperate marine reserves (1999) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 189, pp. 125-134; Babcock, R.C., Shears, N.T., Alcala, A.C., Barrett, N.S., Edgar, G.J., Lafferty, K.D., McClanahan, T.R., Russ, G.R., Decadal trends in marine reserves: Differential rates of change for direct and indirect effects (2010) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the USA, 107, pp. 18256-18261. , et al. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0908012107; Ballantine, W.J., Marine reserves: Lessons from New Zealand (1989) Progress in Underwater Science, 13, pp. 1-14; Ballantine, W.J., Marine reserves-The need for networks (1991) New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 25, pp. 115-116; Ballantine, W.J., (1991) Marine Reserves for New Zealand, , Bulletin 25.

Material and Method: The results of the questionnaires, which were filled out by 969 students were evaluated in this study. The descriptive characteristics of the students who attended this research were defined. For each scenario, the rates of ""expected responses"" were determined for each question. Results: From 1.8% to 29.2% of the students did not have the perception of what is ""true or false"" or the perception of what is ""crime or not crime"". From 1.9% to 66.1% of the students did not have foresight about the legal meaning and the consequences of the act. The environmental factors did not seem to affect them. Conclusion: The ability to manage behaviour and perception of the legal meaning and the consequences of the act for attributed crimes to every under-18-year-old child should be evaluated in special units and special juvenile courts.","Ability; Age groups; Legal liability; Perception","adolescent; aptitude; article; child; child behavior; child court; child psychiatry; court; criminal behavior; environmental factor; female; forensic medicine; forensic psychiatry; gunshot injury; human; legal liability; male; minor (person); perception; population distribution; questionnaire; responsibility; school child; social worker; theft",,,,,"Hanci, I.H., A social wound which led to child delinquency (1999) Bul Med Chamber Izmir, 6, pp. 24-28; Oral, G., Forensic psychiatry (1999) Forensic Medicine, 3, pp. 1377-1572. , In: (Soysal Z, Cakali{dotless}r C, eds).

Twin Oaks Valley Road, San Marcos, CA 92096, United States","One component of hindsight bias is memory distortion. This component is measured with a memory design, in which individuals answer questions, learn the correct answers, and recall their original answers. Hindsight bias occurs when participants' recollections are closer to the correct answers than their original judgments actually were. The present study used a memory design to examine the relationship between response time in recalling original answers and the magnitude of hindsight bias. In Experiment 1, participants' response times were negatively correlated with a hindsight bias index. In Experiment 2, half of the participants were instructed to recall their original judgments quickly and the other participants were instructed to take time to recall their judgments. The hindsight bias index was greater among rapidly responding participants than among delayed responding participants. These results, in conjunction with other findings, support a separate components view of hindsight bias. The memory distortion component of hindsight bias appears to occur quickly, and unbiased responding requires time for processing. This finding relates the memory distortion component of hindsight bias to other cognitive biases, such as the belief bias in syllogistic reasoning. The relationship of this hindsight bias component to dual-process models of cognition is discussed, and several avenues for additional research are suggested. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","Dual processes; Hindsight bias; Memory; Response time","adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; article; decision making; female; human; male; middle aged; physiology; predictive value; psychological model; reaction time; recall; statistical bias; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Bias (Epidemiology); Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Predictive Value of Tests; Reaction Time; Young Adult",,,,,"Barrett, L.F., Tugade, M.M., Engle, R.W., Individual differences in working memory capacity and dual process theories of the mind (2004) Psychological Bulletin, 130, pp. 553-573. , doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.130.4.553; Bernstein, D.M., Atance, C., Loftus, G.R., Meltzoff, A., We saw it all along: Visual hindsight bias in children and adults (2004) Psychological Science, 15, pp. 264-267. , doi: 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00663.x; Bernstein, D.M., Erdfelder, E., Meltzoff, A.N., Peria, W., Loftus, G.R., Hindsight bias from 3 to 95 years of age (2011) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory, and Cognition, 37, pp. 378-391. , doi: 10.1037/a0021971; Blank, H., Musch, J., Pohl, R.F., Hindsight bias: On being wise after the event (2007) Social Cognition, 25, pp. 1-9. , doi: 10.1521/soco.2007.25.1.1; Blank, H., Nestler, S., Perceiving events as both inevitable and unforeseeable in hindsight: The Leipzig candidacy for the Olympics (2006) British Journal of Social Psychology, 45, pp. 149-160. , doi: 10.1348/014466605X52326; Blank, H., Nestler, S., Cognitive process models of hindsight bias (2007) Social Cognition, 25, pp. 132-146. , doi: 10.1521/soco.2007.25.1.132; Blank, H., Nestler, S., von Collani, G., Fischer, V., How many hindsight biases are there (2008) Cognition, 106, pp. 1408-1440. , doi: 10.1016/j.cognition.2007.07.007; Blank, H., Peters, J.H., Controllability and hindsight components: Understanding opposite hindsight biases for self-relevant negative outcomes (2010) Memory & Cognition, 38, pp. 356-365. , doi: 10.3758/MC.38.3.356; Bryant, F.B., Brockway, J.H., Hindsight bias in reaction to the verdict in the O.

Cognitive deficits are a common long-term effect in brain tumor survivors. The objective of this paper is to examine whether these deficits are specific to those diagnosed with and treated for a primary brain tumor. A systematic review of the medical literature from 2002 to 2012 was conducted to investigate neurocognitive deficits in brain tumor survivors (post-primary treatment) compared to healthy controls. Four studies were identified that met all inclusion criteria. Gliomas were the most common form of tumor included. Neuropsychological evaluation identified cognitive deficits in brain tumor survivors on tests of working memory, cognitive control and flexibility, cognitive processing speed, visual searching, planning and foresight, and general attention. While age, education, and gender can influence cognitive function, the present review indicates that deficits exist beyond those accounted for by these factors. Many primary brain tumor survivors are involved in roles (e.g., employee, parent, spouse/partner, student) that require optimal performance of these cognitive skills. Future research should evaluate brain tumor survivors on functional challenges resulting from these cognitive sequelae and develop effective ways to mitigate them. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","Cancer survivor;

This enables nanomaterials to be examined more effectively because applications depend on risk assessments by potential users who are likely to display a range of risk thresholds. Results of certain tools, such as TechFARM™, ADAMS™, and NESTS™ are discussed in the context of societal benefits that nanotechnology may offer. Strategic decision-making requires a knowledge base, analytical capability, foresight, risk-assessment, and optimization. The methodology and results presented here will assist strategic policy implications of the use of nanomaterials and their environment, health, and safety (EHS) implications. The basic premise of the methodology is to provide a vision into the future by scientific and cross-validated models that can address the contingent nature of many of these applications, and thereby help us prepare for and so help to mitigate whatever risks or be more ready to act on opportunities that may arise. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Foresight; Nanomaterials; Risk-assessment; Science convergence",,,,,,"Vaseashta, A., The potential utility of advanced sciences convergence (2012) Advances in Neurotechnology - Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues, pp. 15-36. , Giordano J (ed).

Using this basic structure, slight variations can be made and tested experimentally to begin establishing a cause-and-effect relationship for vein placement. This will aid in the future development of an optimized wing utilizing aerodynamic loads to cause wing shape.

Portugal is at the forefront of the European intention, with a 31% target. The advantages of the application of renewable energy policies are widely accepted to include a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and an improvement in energy security. In many cases job creation is also touted as a benefit but this claim stands on an uncertain footing. Amongst the variety of methodologies, analytical studies using extensive surveys seem to be more appropriate for regional studies while linear simulations, either in the form of input-output (I-O) analysis or, in recent years, social accounting matrix (SAM) multiplier analysis appear to better suit national and international studies. This paper offers an assessment of the impact of Portuguese 'green' energy policies on the employment level departing from a system of symmetric input-output tables recently built for Portugal by the Department of Foresight and Planning.

This is an opinion piece. The cost of basic knowledge assets, with the rise of “big data” and the internet, are asymptotically approaching zero, questioning why the increasing demand for access cannot be met at lower cost at the gates of the “Ivory Tower”. This is and will continue to have increased impact on how basic baccalaureate knowledge is delivered and certified The “bar” for job entrance has been raised beyond the secondary school diploma. At the same time, the removal of bottlenecks for post-secondary certification, internationally, will change the nature of employment of graduates and also the entire infrastructure of the bachelor-level institutional programs. This is a contrarian foresight essay designed to provoke discussion at the systems level of education in general and post-secondary programs in particular. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Baccalaureate; California universities; Education; Faculty; Foresight; Future; Institutional change; Knowledge; Open access; Post-secondary; United States of America; Universities",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10748121,,,,"English","Horizon",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883132082

Much of the discussion has focussed on greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production and the contribution from meat production and dairying has been highlighted. These protein-rich foods are features of Western-style diets and as such make a substantial contribution to intakes of a wide range of essential nutrients. Therefore, it is important to understand the impact on overall dietary patterns and associated nutrient intakes if consumption levels fall, as well as the impact from a sustainability standpoint. From a nutritional perspective, the initial knee jerk reaction around simply eating less meat is already being replaced by a more sophisticated debate that is now considering whether a healthy diet, as currently framed by food-based dietary guidelines, can also be a sustainable dietary pattern now and in the future. There are some important questions that need to be addressed in order for a clearer picture to emerge. For example, it is as yet unclear what dietary choices consumers would make if their consumption of these foods were to be reduced, what effect these choices would have on their health and on sustainability of the food supply, and which groups of the population or individuals within households will be most vulnerable, recognising that there are demographic changes already underway associated with an ageing population. This paper provides a viewpoint through the lens of nutrition and summarises some of the initiatives already underway in relation to food security. © 2013 British Nutrition Foundation Nutrition Bulletin.","Food security; Global; Nutrition; Sustainability",,,,,,"Bates, B., Lennox, A., Bates, C., (2011) National Diet and Nutrition Survey, , Headline results from Years 1 and 2 (combined) of the Rolling Programme (2008/2009-2009/10); Battisti, D.S., Naylor, R.L., Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat (2009) Science, 323, pp. 240-244; (2012) Countryfile, , BBC,The Cost of our Wet Summer Broadcast 7 September 2012; Benton, T., Gallani, B., Jones, C., (2012) Severe weather and UK food resilience, , http://wwwfoodsecurity.ac.uk/assets/pdfs/frp-severe-weather-uk-food-chain-resilience.pdf, Available at (accessed 7 March 2013); Berners-Lee, M., Hoolohan, C., Cammack, H., The relative greenhouse gas impacts of realistic dietary choices (2012) Energy Policy, 43, pp. 184-190; Bridge, J., Banwart, S., (2012) Securing soils for sustainable agriculture: a science-led strategy, , http://wwwrsc.org/images/081203%20OSCAR%20web_tcm18-222767.pdf, Available at (accessed 7 March 2013); Buttriss, J., Riley, H., (2013) Sustainable diets: harnessing the nutrition agenda, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.01.083, Food Chemistry Available at (accessed 17 April 2013); Buttriss, J.L., Food reformulation: the challenges to the food industry (2013) The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 72, pp. 61-69; (2008) Food Matters Towards a Strategy for the 21st Century, , CO (Cabinet Office).

Location of a shopping mall is one of the critical criteria, because it can influence the success of the project. In addition, selecting an appropriate location to establish a new shopping mall is a sophisticated, time consuming and risky decision. Commonly multi-factors should be considered in the decision making model. Thus, a comprehensive model should be considered for similar studies. Moreover, the foresight perspective can be necessary for the future competitiveness of the project. Decision makers need powerful tools for the process of the decision making, for this aim two Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods are applied in our model. Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) is applied to decision making in order to prioritize and calculating the relative importance of the criteria. Then, Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) methodology is used to evaluate potential alternatives. Tehran is considered as a real example of this research and potential places for this mean considered in research. This brand-new hybrid MCDM method is presented in this research as a powerful framework is decision making. This framework can be useful as an appropriate framework for solving locating issues in other companies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore in this work minimizing mobile power consumption is proposed by matching clustered subscribers with constant throughput needs and by using convex optimization methods. © 2013 IEEE.","Convex optimization; Digital divide; Green communication; Mobile data need; Reduced power consumption","Convex optimization methods; Digital divide; Green communications; Istanbul; Mobile data; Mobile subscribers; Reduced power consumption; Wireless communications; Communication; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Convex optimization",,,,,"Qiu, X., Chawla, K., On the performance of adaptive modulation in cellular systems (1999) IEEE Trans.

And they are welcome in the near future for general road transportation. When EVs are connected to the power grid for charging and/or discharging, they become gridable EVs (GEVs). These GEVs will bring a great impact to our society and thus human life. This paper investigates and discusses the opportunities and challenges of GEVs connecting with the grid, namely, the vehicle-to-home (V2H), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies.

It follows the CST-100 parachute system development for the Commercial Crew Development II (CCDev II) phase of work. During this development phase Airborne Systems worked with Boeing to adopt only the best of the many program management practices and procedures that are used for government customers. A small dedicated team was formed to provide continuity throughout the project and thus optimize the overall effort. Risk was minimized or avoided altogether by benefitting from the vast knowledge of past and ongoing government programs. This experience helped forecast potential system enhancements such as integration and installation foresight, simplified routing and parachute components, and additional system flexibility. Moreover, by adopting AS heritage systems and parachute planforms to fit the CST-100 recovery requirements, critical time was redirected on design maturation and simplification in order to provide a highly effective, yet lean system. This led to the initial system development, marked by two highly successful development parachute drop tests, thus paving the road ahead for further qualification of the CST-100 parachute system. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

We show that there are two general classes of steady states within this framework: those where strictly dominated forecasting rules vanish, and those heterogeneous states where a positive proportion of agents uses a more costly perfect foresight. We demonstrate that intrinsic heterogeneity can also arise in a model where the forecasting rules are not equally costly and do not exhibit identical performance in the long run. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive learning; Cobweb model; Heterogeneous expectations; Rational expectations",,,,,,"Anderson, R.D.J., Becker, R., Osborn, D.R., (2010), Heterogeneity in consumers learning about inflation.

This paper categorizes the SR problems according to their input and output conditions into three main categories: reconstruction-based SR, video SR and single image SR. For each category, the development history, common algorithm classes and state-of-the-art research achievements are reviewed comprehensively. We also analyze the characteristics of different algorithms. Afterwards, we discuss the combination of different super-resolution categories and the evaluation of image and video qualities. Thoughts and foresights of this field are given at the end of this paper. Copyright © 2013 Acta Automatica Sinica.

In many cases, these technologies will determine the development and restructuring of industries as never before. These changes, in turn, will promote debates and revisions of current regulatory frameworks and corporate business models. This paper - which is based on a prospective study carried out by the authors in 2010 - emphasizes the importance of understanding and anticipating movements of driving forces, trends and critical uncertainties at global level, which will influence the diffusion of emerging technologies into industrial processes and business models concerning seven societal sectors. The purpose of this paper is to describe the evolutionary trajectories of these sectors, based on diffusion of the so-called emergent technologies in a time horizon of 20 years. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.","Emerging technologies; Prospective studies; Public policies; Sustainable development; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Bergek, A., (2002) Shaping and exploiting technological opportunities: The case of renewable energy technology in Sweden, , Department of Industrial Dynamics.

Due to web 2.0, enterprise 2.0 solutions and the growing number of intermediaries, the ease and speed of identifying and reaching potential innovation partners, knowledge owners or technology providers has changed dramatically in recent years. Approaches like corporate venturing, participating in publicly funded joint research projects, corporate foresight, and direct acquisition of technology providers have found increasing interest within industrial organizations over the past few years. Evonik Industries relies on the innovation approach of positioning technology scouts in all important growth regions globally, who act as agents for the operative business units and at the same time run a kind of blue-sky scouting for strategic topics of the company. To survive in an increasingly global competition, it is more than essential to be able to identify and join forces with the right innovation partner, who offers exactly the missing piece of knowledge and competence that is needed in order to launch the next innovation more efficiently and faster than the competitors. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Bennett's contribution is remembered as one of the first to demonstrate how any deterministic computation can be simulated by a logically reversible Turing machine. Perhaps less remembered is that the same paper suggests the use of nucleic acids to realise physical reversibility. In context, Bennett's foresight predates Leonard Adleman's famous experiments to solve instances of the Hamiltonian path problem using strands of DNA - a landmark date for the field of natural computing - by more than twenty years. The ensuing time has seen active research in both reversible computing and natural computing that has been, for the most part, unrelated. Encouraged by new, experimentally viable DNA computing models, there is a resurgent interest in logically reversible computing by the natural computing community. We survey these recent results, and their underlying ideas, which demonstrate the potential for logically and physically reversible computation using nucleic acids. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","natural computing; reversible computing","DNA computing model; Hamiltonian path problems; In contexts; Natural Computing; Reversible computations; Reversible Computing; Reversible Turing machines; Hamiltonians; Turing machines; Nucleic acids",,,,,"Adleman, L.M., Molecular computation of solutions to combinatorial problems (1994) Science, 266 (5187), pp. 1021-1024; Bennett, C.H., Logical reversibility of computation (1973) IBM Journal of Research and Development, 17 (6), pp. 525-532; Cardelli, L., Two-domain DNA strand displacement (2010) Developments in Computational Models, 26, pp. 47-61; Chen, H.-L., Doty, D., Soloveichik, D., Deterministic function computation with chemical reaction networks (2012) DNA 2012.

All three books follow the evolving forefront of innovations towards Sustainable Cities. They collectively try to respond to the questions: What future cities wish to build (with their scarcities and capacities) on a finite planet? What do-they do to achieve this? How do-they contribute to redesign the world? The third book adopts, first and foremost, a strategic foresight approach including a scan of the future trends, tensions and risks in a more uncertain world, the possible and preferable futures, emerging policy issues, such as intergenerational cities or cities welcoming the immigrants and their impact on sustainable development, the Rio+20 prospects and the effects of the protracted crisis, efforts by world interconnected cities, including a case-study on Bangkok, a laboratory of urban change, and examples of frugal and resilient urban policies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The answer to that question largely depends on their level of awareness of what was happening in the South Slavic federation in the run-up to war. This article analyzes a string of newly declassified documents of the British Foreign Office related to the February 1991 visit of a high-level British political delegation to Yugoslavia, together with interviews with some of the meetings' protagonists. These declassified documents and interviews offer a unique snapshot in the development of the Yugoslav crisis and Britain's policy in the region. They give us a clear picture of the goals and strategies of the principal Yugoslav players and show us what the West knew about the true nature of the Yugoslav crisis and when. The article's conclusions are clear. Yugoslavia's breakup and impending violence did not require great foresight. Their cause was known well in advance because it was preannounced- it was the plan of the Serbian regime of Slobodan Milošević to impose a centralized Yugoslavia upon the other republics or, if that failed, to use force to create a Greater Serbia on Yugoslavia's ruins. Crucially, British policy at the time did nothing to dissuade Milošević from his plan and likely contributed to his confidence in using violence to pursue the creation of a new and enlarged Serbian state. © 2013 Sage Publications.","Breakup of yugoslavia; British foreign policy; Division of bosnia-herzegovina; Greater serbia; Yugoslav wars",,,,,,"Ullman, R., The Wars in Yugoslavia and the International System after the Cold War (1996) The World and Yugoslavia's Wars, pp. 14-15. , ed.

Simultaneous values of cerebral tissue oxygenation (StO2) are measured using both devices in 15 term and 15 preterm clinically stable newborns on the first and third day of life. Values are recorded simultaneously in two periods between which oximeter sensor positions are switched to the contralateral side. Agreement between StO2 values before and after the change of sensor position is analyzed. We find that mean cerebral StO2 values are similar between devices for term and preterm babies, but INVOS shows StO2 values spread over a wider range, with wider standard deviations than shown by the FORE-SIGHT. There is relatively good agreement with a bias up to 3.5% and limits of agreement up to 11.8%. Measurements from each side of the forehead show better repeatability for the FORE-SIGHT monitor. We conclude that performance of the two devices is probably acceptable for clinical purposes. Both performed sufficiently well, but the use of FORE-SIGHT may be associated with tighter range and better repeatability of data. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","biomedical optics; infrared spectroscopy; medicine; neonate; oximetry; tissues","Biomedical optics; Cerebral tissues; neonate; Oximeter sensors; Oximetry; Simultaneous use; Standard deviation; Tissue oxygenation; Infrared spectroscopy; Light emitting diodes; Medicine; Oximeters; Oxygenation; Sensors; Tissue; oxygen; oxygen; article; brain; comparative study; equipment; equipment design; equipment failure; evaluation study; female; human; male; metabolism; near infrared spectroscopy; newborn; oximetry; oxygen consumption; physiology; prematurity; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; brain; device failure analysis; devices; metabolism; near infrared spectroscopy; oximetry; oxygen consumption; physiology; Brain; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Oximetry; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Premature Birth; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Brain; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Oximetry; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Premature Birth; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen, S88TT14065; Oxygen",,,"Wolfberg, A.J., Du Plessis, A.J., Near-Infrared Spectroscopy in the Fetus and Neonate (2006) Clinics in Perinatology, 33 (3), pp. 707-728. , DOI 10.1016/j.clp.2006.06.010, PII S0095510806000558, Brain Monitoring in the Neonate; Greisen, G., Leung, T., Wolf, M., Has the time come to use near-infrared spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool in preterm infants undergoing intensive care?

These were first established in 1875, and currently cover in excess of 1,257,000. ha, of which 39.1% comprise Eucalyptus spp. They are concentrated in limited areas of high rainfall which are critically important source areas for rivers. Originally covered by seasonally dormant grasslands and Fynbos (Macchia shrub), their replacement by deep rooted evergreen trees has increased evapotranspiration, and reduced catchment water yields.Concern over impacts of forest plantations on catchment water yields in South Africa were already being expressed by 1915. Research on this subject started in 1937 and continues today. Methodologies have changed over the years, providing increasingly realistic estimates of the hydrological impacts of forest plantations, and changing perceptions of their water-use. Regulations were introduced by Government in 1972 to curb expansion of forest plantations in catchments where water supply is fully committed. A new Water Act in 1998 laid the foundation for a more equitable water allocation system based on the principle of integrated water resource management. Among other adopted principles, it recognizes that water resources can only be effectively managed within larger catchments, that local interested and affected parties should participate in the management of the water resource, and that water must be allocated equitably and used beneficially in the public interest. This has shifted the research effort towards measurement and modeling of ET at large catchment scale, as well as linking water-use to the economic benefits obtained from forests and crops. A clearer and more balanced picture of the efficiency of water-use by forest plantations and other major crop species is now emerging, but further studies are required.The forestry industry showed considerable foresight in initiating research into the water-use efficiency (WUE) of Eucalyptus clones in the 1990s. These investigations need to continue, not only to search for genotypes that limit the current hydrological impacts of forest plantations, but also to explore options for sustainable management of forest plantations into a future with potentially significant climate change. Environmental stresses in plantation trees may increase in response to such factors as a reduction in rainfall, changes in rainfall intensity, changes in rainfall distribution and increased vapor pressure deficits. WUE is likely to decrease in response to greater physiological stress, and clones may be available to minimize production and economic losses under such a scenario. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Eucalyptus; Evapotranspiration; Hydrological impacts; South Africa; Water-use efficiency","Equitable water allocations; Eucalyptus; Hydrological impacts; Integrated water resource management; South Africa; Sustainable management; Vapor pressure deficit; Water use efficiency; Catchments; Climate change; Cloning; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Laws and legislation; Losses; Physiological models; Rain; Research; Runoff; Water management; Water supply; Forestry; catchment; economic analysis; environmental stress; evapotranspiration; evergreen tree; forest management; grassland; literature review; measurement method; precipitation intensity; rainfall; resource allocation; seasonality; shrub; state role; sustainable development; tree planting; water use efficiency; Eucalyptus; Evaporation; Forests; Hydrology; Plantations; Rivers; Runoff; South Africa; Transpiration; Water Supply; South Africa; Eucalyptus",,,,,"Bastiaanssen, W.G.M., Menenti, M., Feddes, R.A., Holtslag, A.A.M., A remote sensing surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL), Part 1: formulation (1998) J.

However, there is a risk of leaking new ideas by users who join a discussion to generate ideas. In order to avoid the risk, this study proposes a new workshop method to generate business ideas. In the workshop method, idea generators are required to discuss new business ideas based on information that is organized by users who do not join the discussion and thus never know new ideas that are created in this workshop. Idea generators who are given the user-organized information are considered to be able to create new ideas using the given information. We conducted an experiment to test this. In our experiment, participants were divided into two groups: the first group was asked to generate new business ideas based on the information with user perspective while the second group was asked to do so based on the information with engineer perspective. Performance of the first group was compared with that of the second group. Eight outside experts rated all ideas generated in terms of novelty, benefit and feasibility. The result showed that the ideas generated by the first group were rated significantly higher in terms of novelty as well as lower in terms of feasibility than the ideas generated by the second group. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey carried out to those who joined this workshop supported this finding. Our findings suggest that our workshop method is useful for bringing user perspective into actual business idea generation. © The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence 2013.","Business idea; Creativity; Future foresight; User innovation; Workshop","Artificial intelligence; Business idea; Creativity; Future foresight; User innovation; Workshop; Experiments",,,,,"Allen, T.J., (1977) Managing the Flow of Technology: Technology Transfer and the Dissemination of Technological Information Within the R&D Organization, , MIT Press; Amabile, T.M., Barsade, S.G., Mueller, J.S., Staw, B.M., Affect and creativity at work (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, pp. 367-403; Berthon, P.R., Pitt, L.F., McCarthy, I., Kates, S.M., When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers (2007) Business Horizons, 50 (1), pp. 39-47; Franke, N., Von Hippel, E., Schreier, M., Finding commercially attractive user innovations: A test of lead user theory (2006) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 23 (4), pp. 301-315; Fuchs, C., Schreier, M., Customer empowerment in new product development (2011) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 28 (1), pp. 17-32; Gordon, T.J., Helmer-Hirschberg, O., (1964) Report On a Long-Range Forecasting Study, , RAND Corporation; Guilford, J.P., (1967) The Nature of Human Intelligence, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Kristensson, P., Gustafsson, A., Archer, T., Harnessing the creative potential among users (2004) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 21 (1), pp. 4-14; Lilien, G.L., Morrison, P.D., Searls, M.S., Von Hippel, E., Performance assessment of the lead user idea-generation process for new product development (2002) Management Science, 48 (8), pp. 1042-1059; Moreau, P.C., Dahl, D.W., Designing the solution: The impact of constraints on consumers' creativity (2005) Journal of Consumer Research, 32, pp. 13-22; Ogawa, S., Piller, F.T., Collective customer commitment: Reducing the risks of new product development (2006) MIT Sloan Management Review, 47 (2), pp. 65-72; Piller, F.T., Walcher, D., Toolkits for idea competitions: A novel method to integrate users in new product development (2006) R&D Management, 36 (3), pp. 307-318; Sawhney, M., Verona, G., Prandelli, E., Collaborating to create: The Internet as a platform for customer engagement in product innovation (2005) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 19, pp. 4-17; Schoemaker, P.J., Day, G.S., Snyder, S.A., Integrating organizational networks, weak signals, strategic radars and scenario planning (2013) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 80 (4), pp. 815-824; Stroebe, W., Diehl, M., Why groups are less effective than their members: On productivity losses in idea-generating groups (1994) European Review of Social Psychology, 5, pp. 271-303; Terwiesch, C., Ulrich, K.T., (2009) Innovation Tournaments: Creating and Selecting Exceptional Opportunities, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Vincenti, W.G., (1990) What engineers know and how they know it, , MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; von Hippel, E., (1988) The Sources of Innovation, , NY: Oxford University Press; von Hippel, E., Sticky information and the locus of problem solving: Implications for innovation (1994) Management Science, 40 (4), pp. 429-439; Washida, Y., Collaborative structure between Japanese hightech manufacturers and consumers (2005) Journal of Consumer Marketing, 22, pp. 24-35",,,,,,,,,13460714,,,,"Japanese","Trans.

Unfortunately, currently there is no guidance about which neighborhood indicators forecast future neighborhood changes. This study seeks a neighborhood early warning indicator that is readily available, frequently updated, and that predicts with substantial foresight and accuracy future changes in key aspects of neighborhood market processes and quality of life. We search over a range of neighborhood indicators for one or more that clearly lead others in a temporal sense, instead of lagging behind them. We employ Granger causality tests with indicators related to public safety, housing market, and economic activity that are based on data from Chicago neighborhoods between 1998 and 2009. Our key finding is that only one indicator analyzed, completed home foreclosures, systematically precedes other neighborhood indicators but does not systematically follow after them. All other indicators are enmeshed in complicated, often mutually causal temporal patterns, which render them inappropriate for forecasting. We conclude that completed home foreclosures is an appropriate early warning indicator of neighborhood decline in several dimensions. Takeaway for practice: Planners interested in identifying imminently emerging problems in their constituents neighborhoods should regularly acquire and map data on home foreclosures as soon as they become available, and then undertake compensatory actions as quickly as feasible. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","foreclosures; Granger causality; neighborhood decline; neighborhood indicators","accuracy assessment; early warning system; economic analysis; future prospect; Granger causality test; housing market; neighborhood; planning method; quality of life; socioeconomic indicator; urban housing; Chicago; Illinois; United States",,,,,"Anenberg, E., Kung, E., (2012) Estimates of the Size and Source of Price Declines Due to Nearby Foreclosures: Evidence from San Francisco (Finance and Economics Discussion Series Working Paper 2012-84), , Washington, DC: Federal Reserve Board; Auclair, C., Karl, G., The habitat agenda, global urban indicators, and the city development index (2002) Global Outlook, 3, pp. 20-24; Batabyal, S., Temporal causality and the dynamics of crime and delinquency (2011) Atlantic Economic Journal, 39 (4), pp. 421-441; Baumer, E., Wolff, K., Arnio, A., A multicity neighborhood analysis of foreclosure and crime (2012) Social Science Quarterly, 93 (3), pp. 577-601; Baxter, V., Lauria, M., Residential mortgage foreclosure and neighborhood change (2000) Housing Policy Debate, 11 (3), pp. 675-699; Carter, W.H., Schill, M.H., Wachter, S.M., Polarisation, public housing and racial minorities in US cities (1998) Urban Studies, 35 (10), pp. 1889-1911. , DOI 10.1080/0042098984204; Crowder, K., The racial context of white mobility: An individual-level assessment of the white flight hypothesis (2000) Social Science Research, 29 (2), pp. 223-257; Cui, L., (2010) Foreclosure, Vacancy and Crime (Department of Economics Working Paper), , Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh; Denton, N., Massey, D., Patterns of neighborhood transition in a multiethnic world: U.S. Metropolitan areas, 1970-1980 (1991) Demography, 28 (1), pp. 41-63; Dewar, M., Basmajian, C., Alter, R., Law, B., Early detection of changing neighborhood indicators (2005) The ACSP Annual Meeting, , November, Paper presented, Kansas City, MO; Downs, A., (1981) Neighborhoods and Urban Development, , Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution; Ellen, I., (2000) Sharing America's Neighborhoods: The Prospects for Stable Racial Integration, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Ellen, I., Lacoe, J., Sharygin, C., Do foreclosures cause crime?

This development represented a philosophical shift from a neutral presentation of methods without particular advocacy for one or the other. The challenge that this neutral approach presented is that each method is somewhat different and especially for those new to foresight, it became challenging to find common ground, distinguish them, or to know when to use one or the other. Our experience is that our initial wariness of promoting a standard method and thus a ""one-right-way"" of doing foresight proved unfounded. Not only does it not detract from the teaching of other methods, in fact it has made it easier. Framework Foresight was deliberately built to accommodate and incorporate other methods and approaches. It provides a basis of comparison of how various practitioners and methods do the work, enabling them to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. Framework Foresight thus could be viewed as a meta-method in that it is a modular approach that accommodates a substitution of, or supplementation from, other methods or techniques at various steps. As students became practitioners and used the method in their practice, they have provided useful feedback and have generally reported back good results. Thus, Framework Foresight is offered to the foresight community as a method for carrying out foresight projects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Forecasting; Foresight method; Framework Foresight; Scenarios","advocacy; education; forecasting method; philosophy; student; teaching; university sector; Houston; Texas; United States",,,,,"Woodgate, D., (2004) Future Frequencies, , Fringecore Publishing, Austin, TX; Micic, P., (2010) The Five Futures Glasses: How to See and Understand More of the Future with the Eltville Model, , Palgrave Macmillan, Houndmills; Schwartz, P., (1996) The Art of the Long View: Planning for the Future in an Uncertain World, , Currency Doubleday, New York, NY; (2008) What if?

The methodology's name is ""methodology of business ecosystem network analysis"" (MOBENA). The paper shows how it is possible to systematically study the structure and fluxes of a business ecosystem. The main problems of other modelling languages for firm interactions that MOBENA tries to overcome are that (1) the methodologies tailored for BEs are very few, the others neglect interdependences or focus only on tangible or intangible aspects, and (2) they limit potential for strategic analysis and they do not take in a future-perspective. The paper includes an analysis of literature on Strategic Management (in particular, strategic models on relationships), Network Analysis and Foresight, from whence the theoretical proposal of the MOBENA is born. Then, the authors illustrate its application via a case study conducted inside the Telecom Italia Future Centre, and in particular taking as example the digital imaging ecosystem. The original aspects are the mapping of tangible and intangible relationships, the dynamic and foresight analysis, the possibility to set strategic guidance thanks to specific indicators. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Business ecosystem; Case study; Foresight; Methodology of business ecosystem network analysis; Telecom Italia Future Centre","Business ecosystem; Foresight; Modelling language; Network structures; Strategic analysis; Strategic guidance; Strategic management; Telecom italia; Research; Telecommunication; Telecommunication systems; Ecosystems; business; digital image; ecosystem modeling; methodology; network analysis; strategic approach; Italy",,,,,"Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , Free Press, New York; Allee, V., (2002) The Future of Knowledge: Increasing Prosperity through Value Networks, , Butterworth Heinemann, Boston; Moore, J.F., Predators and prey: a new ecology of competition (1993) Harv.

When times are good, moving forward in a predictable manner, the things that made an incumbent company a success tend to sustain continued success. But in turbulent times, that expertise can fuel a kind of 'innovation blindness', a failure to grasp what the key drivers to future success might.

This article analyses six procedural rule-sets (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, Permanent Court of Arbitration, International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, International Law Commission (ICC), International Bar Association (IBA) and the European Union special regime) from three angles: first, bringing the relevant (co-responsible) parties before the tribunal, including constitution of the tribunal, jurisdiction and determination of claimant and respondent status. Secondly, handling multi-party disputes in terms of evidence and fact-finding, joinder and consolidation of proceedings. Thirdly, regarding absent (co-responsible) parties, addressing intervention and the effect of provisional measures and final awards. Most rule-sets provide guidance for most of these issues, with particularly remarkable foresight in the IBA and ICC rules. These are primarily aimed at regulating international commercial arbitration, but can with some modification also be applied in international public arbitration. The key recommendation is for drafters to anticipate shared responsibility claims at the outset by including appropriate procedural rules when the agreement is being negotiated. © The Author 2013.

The results integrated existing social (including existing public perception) environmental and economic knowledge regarding GM animals to formulate policy recommendations relevant to new developments and applications. The use of GM in farmed animals (aquatic, terrestrial and pharmaceutical) was mapped and reviewed. A foresight exercise was conducted to identity future developments. Three case studies (aquatic, terrestrial and pharmaceutical) were applied to identify the issues raised, including the potential risks and benefits of GM animals from the perspectives of the production chain (economics and agri-food sector) and the life sciences (human and animal health, environmental impact, animal welfare and sustainable production). Ethical and policy concerns were examined through application of combined ethical matrix method and policy workshops. The case studies were also used to demonstrate the utility of public engagement in the policy process. The results suggest that public perceptions, ethical issues, the competitiveness of EU animal production and risk-benefit assessments that consider human and animal health, environmental impact and sustainable production need to be considered in EU policy development. Few issues were raised with application in the pharmaceutical sector, assuming ethical and economic issues were addressed in policy, but the introduction of agricultural GM animal applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,"Animal production; Economic knowledge; Ethical perspectives; Genetically modified; Pharmaceutical products; Pharmaceutical sector; Policy recommendations; Sustainable production; Economics; Environmental impact; Philosophical aspects; Public policy; Risk perception; Sustainable development; Veterinary medicine; Animals; lactoferrin; recombinant DNA; animal health; animal welfare; artificial milk; biomedicine; DNA modification; DNA transfer; drug industry; environmental impact; ethics; food industry; nonhuman; policy; priority journal; review; risk benefit analysis; transgenic animal; transgenic cattle; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Bioethical Issues; European Union; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Policy Making; Animalia",,"lactoferrin, 55599-62-7",,,"Horlick-Jones, T., Walls, J., Rowe, G., Pidgeon, N., Poortinga, W., Murdock, G., (2007) The GM debate: risk, politics and public engagement, , Routledge, Oxon; Frewer, L., Lassen, J., Kettlitz, B., Scholderer, J., Beekman, V., Berdal, K.G., Societal aspects of genetically modified foods (2004) Food and Chemical Toxicology, 42 (7), pp. 1181-1193; Knight, A.J., Perceptions, knowledge and ethical concerns with GM foods and the GM process (2009) Public Understanding of Science, 18 (2), pp. 177-188; Pivetti, M., Natural and unnatural: activists' representations of animal biotechnology (2007) New Genetics and Society, 26 (2), pp. 137-157; Kleter, G.A., Kok, E., Safety assessment of biotechnology used in animal production, including genetically modified (GM) feed and GM animals - a review (2010) Animal Science Papers and Reports, 28 (2), pp. 105-114. , http://www.ighz.edu.pl/files/objects/2853/64/strona105-114.pdf, [accessed 10.09.12]; Houdebine, L.M., Production of pharmaceutical proteins by transgenic animals (2009) Comparative Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, 32 (2), pp. 107-121; Kling, J., First US approval for a transgenic animal drug (2009) Nature Biotechnology, 27 (4), pp. 302-304; Vàzquez-Salat, N., Salter, B., Smets, G., Houdebine, L.M., The current state of GMO governance: are we ready for GM animals?

Twenty years ago, many psychoacousticians viewed any consideration of cognitive factors or effects driven by the intent of the listener, rather than the acoustics of the input, as outside of their realm of interest. However, today, a plethora of laboratories are exploring questions about what acoustic features enable listeners to focus attention, how bottom-up stimulus attributes interact with top-down control signals to determine what source a listener attends in a mixture of sources, and what neural mechanisms realize such selective auditory attention. This talk reviews recent work exploring selective auditory attention using a combination of behavioral studies and neuro-imaging techniques, all of which suggest that 1) listeners can focus attention on one, and only one, auditory object or stream at a time, and 2) executive control regions of the brain are engaged during attention to reduce across-object interference in the representation of whatever object is in the attentional foreground. These studies underscore the importance of auditory attention in allowing us to communicate in everyday settings containing multiple sound sources, and thus the foresight of Bert in tackling this problem when most others did not. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic features; Auditory attention; Behavioral studies; Cognitive factors; Neural correlate; Neural mechanisms; Neuroimaging techniques; Top-down control; Imaging techniques; Interference suppression",,,,,"Best, V., Gallun, F.J., Ihlefeld, A., Shinn-Cunningham, B.G., The influence of spatial separation on divided listening (2006) J.

Both methods have demonstrated their ability to extract complex dynamic patterns from time-dependent data in several applications and benchmark studies. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that the proposed combination of algorithms is applied for reliability prediction. The proposed approach is verified on a case study predicting the occurrence of railway operation disruptions based on discrete-event data, which is represented by a binary time series. The case study concerns speed restrictions affecting railway operations, caused by failures of tilting systems of railway vehicles. The overall prediction accuracy of the algorithm is 99.93%; the prediction accuracy for occurrence of speed restrictions within the foresight period is 98% (which corresponds to the sensitivity of the algorithm). The prediction results of the case study are compared to the prediction with a MLP trained with a Newton conjugate gradient algorithm. The proposed approach proves to be superior to MLP. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The simulations identified many challenges: confusion of sequence, blocked calls, wasted crew time, impaired ability to provide relevant information to the other party, losing track of which messages have reached the other party, weakened rapport between crew and ground, slow response to rapidly changing situations, and reduced situational awareness. These challenges were met in part with additional training; greater attention and foresight; longer, less frequent transmissions; meticulous recordkeeping and timekeeping; and specific alerting and acknowledging calls. Several simulations used both delayed voice and text messaging. Text messaging provided a valuable record of transmissions and allowed messages to be targeted to subsets of the flight and ground crew, but it was a poor choice for high-workload operators such as vehicle drivers and spacewalkers. Even with the foregoing countermeasures, delayed voice communication is difficult. Additional aids such as automatic delay timers and voice-to-text transcription would help. Tests comparing delays of 50 and 300 s unexpectedly revealed that communicating with the shorter delay was just as challenging as with the longer one. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IAA.","Deep space exploration; Delayed voice communication; Human space flight; Space flight analog; Speed-of-light delay; Voice communication","Deep-space exploration; Human spaceflights; Recordkeeping; Relevant informations; Shorter delays; Situational awareness; Speed-of-light delay; Vehicle drivers; Manned space flight; Speech communication; Text messaging; Vehicle transmissions",,,,,"Adamo, D.R., Giorgini, J.D., Abell, P.A., Landis, R.R., Asteroid destinations accessible for human exploration: A preliminary survey in mid 2009 (2010) J.

Both this evolutionary richness and the knowledge of enzyme action including the comprehension of interactive effects of the environmental factors, are of key importance to exploit biocatalyst's potential. But above all a marine enzyme may carry novel chemical and stereochemical properties thus biocatalytically oriented studies (testing of suitable substrates, appropriate checking of reaction conditions, study of stereochemical asset of catalysis) should be performed to appropriately reveal this ""chemical biodiversity"". In this review article, comparing among enzymes from terrestrial and marine environments, ten cases in point will be depicted after general considerations on marine organisms and marine biocatalysts. Each case has been selected for its importance related to the field of biocatalysis, showing practical details to value the concept of potential usefulness of marine enzymes for organic chemists. From this analysis a foresight regarding the strategic potential of marine habitat resulted clear. Sustainability of collection methods and availability of commercial fresh organisms are two important aspects, also in relation to international policy on biodiversity. As early as scientific interest arise, possibly the way to access useful biocatalysts should avoid destructive large-scale collections of marine biomass, then recombinant biocatalysts become desirable and should be possible after gene identification. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Biocatalysis; Enzymatic synthesis; Marine enzymes",,,,,,"(2013) Position Paper 15 Marine Biotechnology: A new vision and strategy for Europe Marine Biotechnology, , http://www.esf.org/marineboard, September (Accessed January 22); Wijesinghe, W.A.J.P., Jeon, Y.J., Enzyme-assistant extraction (EAE) of bioactive components: A useful approach for recovery of industrially important metabolites from seaweeds: A review (2012) Fitoterapia, 83, pp. 6-12; Sheldon, R.A., E factors, green chemistry and catalysis: An odyssey (2008) Chem.

An optimized size and regularity can increase the efficiency due largely to avoided non-radiative transitions which can originate from the fluctuations in the bandwidth of the intermediate layer. In this work, we propose all the energy band diagrams possible in the formation of such a cell. Five equivalent band diagrams of the cells with different size dispersions and regularity of quantum dots are considered and compared with the reported experimental profiles in the literature. Furthermore, the degree of the size fluctuation is considered by proposing a fluctuation degree for the band gap and sub-band gaps of the cell. These proposed profiles and the fluctuation theory are exploited to consider the experimental data reported in literature. The optimized size dispersion will increase the photocurrent of the cell. We believe that every quantum dot solar cell will fall into one of the proposed band diagrams. This approach gives foresight to the theoretical studies of such devices and expectation from the energy band structure and band widths since it considers the fluctuation of the band widths for the intermediate band separately. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Fluctuations; Intermediate bandwidth; Nanoparticles; Quantum dots; Size dispersion; Solar cells","Bandwidth fluctuations; Energy-band diagram; Fluctuations; Intermediate-band solar cells; Non-radiative transitions; Quantum dot nanoparticles; Quantum dot solar cells; Size dispersion; Dispersions; Energy gap; Nanoparticles; Optimization; Semiconductor quantum dots; Solar cells; Bandwidth",,,,,"Gorji, N.E., Movla, H., Sohrabi, F., Hosseinpour, A., Rezaei, M., Babaei, H., (2010) Physica e, 42, p. 2353; Movla, H., Sohrabi, F., Fathi, J., Babaei, H., Nikniazi, A., Khalili, K., Gorji, N.E., (2010) Turkish Journal of Physics, 34 (2), p. 97; Tang, J., Kemp, K., Hoogland, S., Jeong, K., Liu, H., Levina, L., Furukawa, M., Sargent, E., (2011) Nature Materials, 10, p. 765; Gorji, N.E., Zandi, M.H., Houshmand, M., Abrari, M., Abaeie, B., (2011) Physica e, 43, p. 989; Gorji, N.E., (2012) Physica e, 44, p. 1608; Gorji, N.E., Zandi, M.H., Houshmand, M., Shokri, M., (2012) Scientia Iranica D, 19 (3), p. 806; Oshima, R., Komiyama, H., Hashimoto, T., Shigekawa, H., Okada, Y., (2006) Proceedings of the Conference Record of the 2006 IEEE 4th World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion, 1, pp. 158-161. , May; Elarde, V.C., Yeoh, T.S., Rangarajan, R., Coleman, J.J., (2004) Journal of Crystal Growth, 272 (1), p. 148; Meixner, M., Scholl, E., Shchukin, V.A., Bimberg, D., (2001) Physical Review Letters, 87, p. 236101; Reynoso, V.C.S., Liu, Y., Rojas, R.F.C., Aranha, N., Cesar, C.L., Barbosa, L.C., Alves, O.L., (1996) Journal of Materials Science Letters, 15 (12), p. 1073; Baskoutas, S., Terzis, A.F., (2006) Journal of Applied Physics, 99, p. 013708; Lin, K.F., Cheng, H.M., Hsu, H.C., Lin, L.J., Hsieh, W.-F., (2005) Chemical Physics Letters, 409, p. 208; Mandal, P., Ghosh, M., (2008) Chemical Physics, 353, p. 37; Dengetal, Q., Wang, X., Yang, C., Xiao, H., Yin, H., Hou, Q., Li, J., Hou, X., (2011) Physica B, 406, p. 73; Gorji, N.E., Houshmand, M., Dehkordi, S.S., (2012) Modern Physics Letters B, 26 (14), p. 1250090; Marti, A., Cuadra, L., Luque, A., (2002) Physica e, 14, p. 150; Zandi, M.H., Houshmand, M., Dehkordi, S.S., Gorji, N.E., (2012) Modern Physics Letters B, 26 (21), p. 1250133; Rahayu, F., Darma, Y., (2011) Proceedings of the Conference on Instrumentation, Communication, Information Technology and Biomedical Engineering, p. 978. , Bandung, Indonesia, November; Werner, J.H., Mattheis, J., Rau, U., (2005) Thin Solid Films, p. 399. , 480481; Gorji, N.E., (2012) Solar Energy, 86, p. 935; Linares, P.G., Marti, A., Antolin, E., Luque, A., (2011) Journal of Applied Physics, 109, p. 014313; Akahane, K., Yamamoto, N., (2010) Physica e, 42, p. 2735; Nikolaev, V.V., Averkiev, N.S., (2009) Applied Physics Letters, 95, p. 263107; Holme, T.P., Chao, C., Prinz, F.B., (2009) Proceeding of the 34th IEEE Conference, Philadelphia, pp. 85-89. , USA; Laghumavarapu, R.B., El-Emawy, M., Nuntawong, N., Moscho, A., Lester, L.F., (2007) Applied Physics Letters, 91, p. 243115; Mintairov, A.M., Blagnov, P.A., Merz, J.L., Ustinov, V.M., Vlasov, A.S., Kovsh, A.R., (2004) Physica e, 21, p. 385; Andrey, V., Semichaevsky, A.V., Johnson, H.T., (2013) Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 108, p. 189199; Xu, C., Li, Z.P., Pan, W., Shen, W.Z., (2011) Applied Surface Science, 257, p. 8409; Li, K.H., Shen, W.Z., (2009) Journal of Applied Physics, 106, p. 063505; Balandin, A.S.A., Fedoseyev, A.I., Turowski, M., (2007) Applied Physics Letters, 91, p. 163503","Gorji, N.E.; Department of New Technologies, University of Tabriz, Tabriz 51566, Iran; email: nima.eshaghigorji@utoledo.edu",,,,,,,,13869477,,PELNF,,"English","Phys E",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878371835

Clients, however, may need to execute a sequence of operations (a composite operation) atomically. We consider the problem of extending a linearizable library to support arbitrary atomic composite operations by clients. We introduce a novel approach in which the concurrent library ensures atomicity of composite operations by exploiting information (foresight) provided by its clients. We use a correctness condition, based on a notion of dynamic rightmovers, that guarantees that composite operations execute atomically without deadlocks, and without using rollbacks. We present a static analysis to infer the foresight information required by our approach, allowing a compiler to automatically insert the foresight information into the client. This relieves the client programmer of this burden and simplifies writing client code. We present a generic technique for extending the library implementation to realize foresight-based synchronization. This technique is used to implement a general-purpose Java library for Map data structures - the library permits composite operations to simultaneously work with multiple instances of Map data structures. We use the Maps library and the static analysis to enforce atomicity of a wide selection of real-life Java composite operations. Our experiments indicate that our approach enables realizing efficient and scalable synchronization for real-life composite operations.","Automatic Synchronization; Composition; Concurrency; Data Structures; Transactions","Automatic synchronization; Client code; Concurrency; Correctness conditions; Java library; Multiple instances; Transactions; Wide selection; Chemical analysis; Data structures; Libraries; Static analysis; Synchronization; Concurrency control",,,,,"gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/jsr166/dist/jsr166edocs/jsr166e/ConcurrentHashMapV8. html; docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap. html; www.devdaily.com/java/jwarehouse/apache-tomcat-6.0.16/java/org/apache/el/ util/ConcurrentCache.java.shtml; docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html; guava-libraries.code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/; Jgroups Toolkit, , www.jgroups.org/index.html; Agrawal, D., Abbadi A, E.L., Constrained shared locks for increasing concurrency in databases (1995) Selected Papers of the ACM SIGMOD Symposium on Principles of Database Systems; Bernstein, P.A., Hadzilacos, V., Goodman, N., (1987) Concurrency Control and Recovery in Database Systems, , Addison-Wesley; Bronson, N., (2011) Composable Operations on High-Performance Concurrent Collections, , PhD thesis, Stanford University, Dec; Cascaval, C., Blundell, C., Michael, M., Cain, H.W., Chiras, S., Chatterjee, S., Software transactional memory: Why is it only a research toy?

The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the project, both nationally and internationally. Design/methodology/approach: This paper assesses the impact of the FFF project, both nationally and internationally, using web searches, document analysis, and a questionnaire survey of key actors in the flood risk management policy field. Findings: It was found that the penetration of the project into professionals' consciousness was high in relation to other comparable projects and publications, and its impact on policy - both immediately and continuing - was profound. The FFF initiative did not create policy change, however, but facilitated its legitimation, adding impetus to what was already there, as one element of a part-catalytic and part-incremental process of policy evolution. Research limitations/implications: Special circumstances, internal and external to the project, mean that this cannot be a simple model for matching research to policymakers' needs in the future. Practical implications: Important lessons may be learnt from this project about both the methods of forward-looking foresight-type research, and the way that its results are disseminated to its target audiences. Originality/value: This is an innovative attempt to assess the impact of a new type of foresight project. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Flooding; Floods; Forecasting; Risk assessment; Risk management; Strategic planning; United Kingdom",,,,,,"(2004) A Changing Climate for Insurance.

Design/methodology/approach: The article describes an informal review of those uses of the Five Ways to Well-being and the dynamic model of well-being which have come to nef's attention. Findings: The Five Ways to Well-being messages are found to have been widely used, both in public health and a variety of other settings. They have been used: to directly promote well-being to individuals; to help frame organisational strategy; and indirectly, in initiatives with headline objectives other than promoting well-being. A number of examples of their use are given in different contexts. The dynamic model of well-being is shown to be a deep influence on nef's continuing well-being work and the work of those influenced in turn by nef, particularly in ensuring that policy and practice takes account of both external conditions as well as personal resources; and of people's feelings as well as their functioning. Practical implications: Future directions for nef's work are highlighted, particularly measurement of involvement in the Five Ways to Well-being activities and exploration of the ways in which different well-being measures impact on policy. Originality/value: The article provides, for the first time, an overview of how nef's contributions to the Foresight Project have been used since their publication, and will be of interest to those in a range of policy and practice settings who value real-life examples of the implementation of a ""well-being approach"". © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Personal health; Public health",,,,,,"Abdallah, S., Shah, S., (2012) Well-Being Patterns Uncovered: An Analysis of UK Data, , New Economics Foundation, London; Aked, J., Thompson, S., (2011) Five Ways to Wellbeing: New Applications, New Ways of Thinking, , New Economics Foundation, London; Aked, J., Michaelson, J., Steuer, N., (2010) The Role of Local Government in Promoting Wellbeing, , Local Government Improvement and Development, London; Aked, J., Marks, N., Cordon, C., Thompson, S., (2008) Five Ways to Well-Being: The Evidence, , New Economics Foundation, London; (2011) Measuring Our Progress: The Power of Well-Being, , New Economics Foundation, London,Centre for Well-being; (2008) Final Project Report, , The Government Office for Science, London,Capital Foresight Mental Project Wellbeing; Frederickson, B., The role of positive emotions in positive psychology: The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions (2001) American Psychologist, 56 (3), pp. 218-226; Henderson, M., Do five simple things a day to stay sane, say scientists (2008), p. 5. , The Times, 22 October, p; Mahony, S., Thompson, S., Seaford, C., Understanding the Barriers to Raising Population Wellbeing: A Report for the Department of Health and Sciencewise-ERC, , www.sciencewise-erc.org.uk/cms/assets/Uploads/Project-files/UnderstandingtheBarrierstoRaisingPopulationWellbeing.pdf, available at,New Economics Foundation, London, n.d; Mangan, L., Five steps to happiness (2008), www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/23/healthandwellbeing, The Guardian, 23 October, available at; Marks, N., Empowering action through the five ways to wellbeing Making the Case for the Social Sciences - Mental Well-Being, , The Academy of Social Sciences, London, in press; Marks, N., (2011) The Happiness Manifesto, , TED Books; Marks, N., Think before you think (2011) Positive Psychology as Social Change, pp. 17-32. , Biswas-Diener, R.

It is based on a foresight research project which investigated the ethical issues of such emerging ICTs. The findings of this research suggest that there are numerous well established ethical issues that are currently being discussed and that will remain relevant. These include questions of privacy and intellectual property. In addition, however, there are numerous possible ethical issues that relate to human individual and collective identity that are likely to be affected by novel technical developments. These issues currently are not discussed in academic or policy discourses. In order to render them more tangible and thus promote academic and policy discourses, fictional accounts play an important role. The present paper should therefore be understood as an attempt to translate the research findings on the ethics of emerging ICTs to a broader audience. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Affective computing; Ambient intelligence; Avatar; Ethics; ETICA project; Foresight; Information and communication technology","ethics; information and communication technology; intellectual property rights; policy analysis; suicide",,,,,"Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes - new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 3, pp. 93-111; Floridi, L., A look into the future impact of ICT on our lives (2007) The Information Society, 23 (1), pp. 59-64; Stahl, B.C., Heersmink, R., Goujon, P., Flick, C., Van Den Hoven, J., Wakunuma, K., Ikonen, V., Rader, M., Identifying the ethics of emerging information and communication technologies: an essay on issues, concepts and method (2010) Journal of Technoethics, 1 (4), pp. 20-38; Stahl, B.C., Rogerson, S., Landscapes of ethical issues of emerging ICT applications in Europe (2009) Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference of Computer Ethics: Philosophical Enquiry; Friedewald, M., Costa, O.D., Punie, Y., Alahuhta, P., Heinonen, S., Perspectives of ambient intelligence in the home environment (2005) Telematics and Informatics, 22 (3), pp. 221-238; Wright, D., Gutwirth, S., Friedewald, M., Vildjiounaite, E., Punie, Y., (2008) Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence, 1. , Springer-Verlag New York Inc, New York; Wright, D., Alternative futures: AmI scenarios and minority report (2008) Futures, 40 (5), pp. 473-488; Bostrom, N., When machines outsmart humans (2003) Futures, 35, pp. 759-764. , September (7); Dreyfus, H.L., (1992) What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason, Revised ed, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Allen, C., Smit, I., Wallach, W., Artificial morality: top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches (2005) Ethics and Information Technology, 7, pp. 149-155. , September (3); Floridi, L., Sanders, J.W., On the morality of artificial agents (2004) Minds and Machines, 14, pp. 349-379. , August (3); Picard, R.W., (1997) Affective Computing, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Picard, R.W., Affective computing: from laughter to IEEE (2010) IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 1 (1), pp. 11-17; Stahl, B.C., What does the future hold?

We argue that health educators can improve training quality by intentionally encouraging errors during simulation-based team training. Preventable medical errors are inevitable, but encouraging errors in low-risk settings like simulation can allow teams to have better emotional control and foresight to manage the situation if it occurs again with live patients. Our paper outlines an innovative approach for delivering team training.",,"emotionality; evidence based practice; experience; health education; health educator; health practitioner; human; management; medical error; patient safety; review; self-directed learning; simulation; training; administrative personnel; behavior control; education; learning; medical error; organization; patient care; prevention and control; psychology; safety; system analysis; teaching; Administrative Personnel; Behavior Control; Humans; Medical Errors; Organizational Innovation; Patient Care Team; Patient Simulation; Safety Management; Systems Integration; Transfer (Psychology)",,,,,"Schulz, K., (2010) Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error, , New York, NY: Harper Collins; Kohn, L.T., Corrigan, J.M., Donaldson, M.S., (1999) To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, , Washington, DC: National Academy Press; Shreve, J., Van Den Bos, T., Gray, J., (2010) The Economic Measurement of Medical Errors, , Schaumberg, IL: Society of Actuaries/Milliman; Orlander, J.D., Barber, T.W., Fincke, B.G., The morbidity and mortality conference: The delicate nature of learning from error (2002) Academic Medicine, 77 (10), pp. 1001-1006; Weick, K.E., Sutcliffe, K.M., (2007) Managing the Unexpected.

Therefore, a proper method to represent the total agricultural production is required. With this in mind, this paper provides an international comparative survey of procedures that aggregate agricultural production. In order to identify international best practices with regard to accounting agricultural production, monetary and physical aggregations to measure food supply are analysed.

Patients with dementia have unquestionably a decreased survival rate compared with those without dementia. Distressing symptoms, such as pain and dyspnea, are common in the last three to six months of their life. Pneumonia and other infections, as well as hip fractures or eating problems are frequent complications in the advanced stage and associated with a high six-month mortality rate. Understanding the clinical course of the final stage of dementia and the possible foresight of the survival time may prevent unnecessary actions and facilitate the benefits of good palliative care at the right moment. Estimating the survival time in dementia remains a difficult exercise due to the individual variability.

Involving stakeholders and citizens in participatory planning is always a challenge for planners, which stresses the need for effective tools, capable of dealing with respective planning efforts. The focus of the present paper is on the development of a methodological framework, which builds upon the integration of an analytical scenario planning model - the LIPSOR model, in support of future anticipation and structuring of scenarios, with a tool supporting stakeholders' and citizens' engagement - the Focus Group methodology, which aims at the support of planners in structuring the context of the participatory process and producing the necessary qualitative information, used in the scenario planning process. The use of the proposed framework can guide the efforts of planners to incorporate views and visions of a range of local actors, when exploring future development paths of a region/problem at hand. The experience gained from the application of this framework in a specific case study at the regional level is also presented, drawing upon the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach, while finally some conclusions are drawn.","Focus groups; LIPSOR model; Participatory planning; Policy; Regional level; Scenario planning",,,,,,"Stratigea, A., Papadopoulou, Ch.-A., Giaoutzi, M., A methodological framework for foresight analysis in ag2020: The case of herakleion - crete region (2008) AG2020 Experts' and Stakeholders' Workshop, , Paper presented at the, Florence, 6-9 October; (2003) Handbook of Knowledge Society Foresight, , European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions; Godet, M., (1994) From Anticipation to Action: A Handbook of Strategic Perspective, , UNESCO Publishing, ISBN 92-3-102832-4; Godet, M., (2001) Creating Futures: Scenario Planning as a Strategic Management Tool, , Economica Ltd, London; Godet, M., Monti, R., Meunier, F., Roubelat, F., (2004) Scenarios and Strategies: A Toolbox for Problem Solving, , Cahiers du LIPSOR, Laboratory for Investigation in Prospective and Strategy, Paris; Ritchey, T., Eriskon, T., Scenario development using computerized morphological analysis (2002) Cornwallis and Winchester International Operational Research Conferences, , www.swemorph.com, Paper presented at the; Kasemir, B., Jaeger, C., Dürrenberg, G., Embedding integrated assessment models in social discourse (1996) Science and Public Policy, 23 (2), pp. 124-125; Berg, B., (1989) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , Pearson Education Company, USA; Stewart, D., Shamdasani, P., (1990) Focus Groups: Theory and Practice, , Sage Publications, 103-424-465, London; Rotmans, J., Methods for IA: The challenges and opportunities ahead (1998) Environmental Modeling and Assessment, 3 (3), pp. 155-180. , Challenges and Opportunities for Integrated Environmental Assessment; Stratigea, A., Grammatikogiannis, E., Giaoutzi, M., How to approach narratives in foresight studies: Qualitative data analysis (2012) Future Perspectives for Sustainable Agriculture, International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy (IJFIP), 8 (2-3), pp. 236-261. , E. van Leeuwen, M.

This editorial provides background for the articles in this special issue, which sample six broad themes in risk assessment in conservation biology and presenting new innovations and applications. Location: Global. Methods: The articles in the special issue address themes related to species distribution modelling, population viability analysis, threatened species management, biosecurity, uncertainty analysis, cost-benefit analysis and foresight. We sought articles that address new and emerging topics in each of these areas. Results: The articles identify new and potentially useful innovations in a variety of areas relevant to conservation biology. Collectively, they paint a picture of risk assessment as an important element in supporting transparent, rational decisions and effective policy. Main conclusions: Policy makers and conservation managers aspire to set evidence-based priorities, and technical specialists aim to have their methods used in decision-making. Scientists will succeed if, as the articles in this issue exemplify, they develop a sound understanding of the context of the decisions in which their tools are to be used and shape them accordingly. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2013.","Biosecurity; Decision analysis; Invasive species; Policy; Population viability; Risk assessment; Spatial analysis; Threatened species; Uncertainty","conservation management; decision making; global perspective; policy development; population distribution; population modeling; risk assessment; species diversity",,,,,"Addison, P.F.E., Rumpff, L., Bau, S.S., Carey, J.M., Chee, Y.E., Jarrad, F.C., McBride, M.F., Burgman, M.A., Practical solutions for making models indispensable in conservation decision-making (2013) Diversity and Distributions, 19, pp. 490-502; Burgman, M.A., (2005) Risks and decisions for conservation and environmental management, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Burgman, M.A., McCarthy, M.A., Robinson, A., Hester, S.M., McBride, M.F., Elith, J., Panetta, F.D., Improving decisions for invasive species management: reformulation and extensions of the Panetta-Lawes eradication graph (2013) Diversity and Distributions, 19, pp. 603-607; Elith, J., Leathwick, J.R., Species distribution models: ecological explanation and prediction across space and time (2009) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, 40, pp. 677-697; Estévez, R.A., Walshe, T., Burgman, M.A., Capturing social impacts for decision-making: a Multicriteria Decision Analysis perspective (2013) Diversity and Distributions, 19, pp. 608-616; Ferlie, E., Conclusion: from evidence to actionable knowledge (2005) Knowledge to action?

Over the last 20 years, numerous government documents have been commissioned and published to inform obesity strategies in the UK. The Health Survey for England, an annual cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative random general population sample in England, collects information on health, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, physical measurements and biological samples. Heights and weights measured by the Health Survey for England are believed to have played a major part in promoting, shaping and evaluating obesity strategies. A formal review of how these data have been used has not been conducted previously. This paper reviews government documents demonstrating the contribution of Health Survey for England examination data to every stage of the policy making process: quantifying the obesity problem in England (e.g. Chief Medical Officer's reports); identifying inequalities in the burden of obesity (Acheson report); modelling potential future scenarios (Foresight); setting and monitoring specific, measurable, attainable targets (calorie reduction challenge in manufacturers' Responsibility Deal); developing and informing strategies and clinical guidance; and evaluating the success of obesity strategies (Healthy Weights, Healthy Lives progress report). Measurement data are needed and used by governments to produce evidence-based strategies to combat obesity. © 2013 International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Evidence-based policy; Health examination survey; Obesity strategy","sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; article; body height; body weight; childhood obesity; cost effectiveness analysis; health behavior; health care policy; health survey; human; infant mortality; lifestyle; management; maternal obesity; medical examination; monitoring; morbid obesity; obesity; physical activity; population; practice guideline; prevalence; public health problem; quality of life; socioeconomics; United Kingdom; England; Forecasting; Health Status Disparities; Health Surveys; Humans; Obesity; Policy Making; Population Surveillance; Public Health",,"sibutramine, 106650-56-0; tetrahydrolipstatin, 96829-58-2",,,"(2007), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2007/np24/en/index.html, World Health Organisation.

Ltd, Chengdu, Sichuan 610031, China","Research purposes: China witnessed an unprecedented upsurge in railway construction from 2000 to 2010 when the trans-regional trunk lines were built and opened to traffic one after another. The transportation demand is crucial to the railway planing and construction and the construction standard and process rely on the transportation demand level. It is necessary to sum up and research the necessity, opportunity and standards of the railways constructions in the last decade to meet the demands of the local economic development. Research conclusions: (1) Through the comparison and analysis of the local economic developments, transportation development and railway transportation before and after railway construction, the Chongqing-Huaihua Railway in general has met the requirement of the local social and economic developments and building the railway is a wise decision-making (2) From the antecedent view, the Chongqing-Huaihua Railway was not built on full consideration of the traffic demand. It would be more reasonable to build the railway in the earlier five years. From the advanced view, the more social resources would be saved if double line was built for one time. (3) After opening to traffic for two years, lots of defaults are exposed, such as being insufficient of equipments and carrying capacity, passenger station faraway from towns and the not closely matching with the local planning. All these indicate that the concept of ""Putting people first"" was not implemented fully in the design, and the demands of the convenience, durableness and perfection are not met while the basic transport requirement are satisfied. (4) The advanced thought and foresight are needed to the railway construction on consideration of the local macro development trend and this is experience of the long-term traffic developments at home and abroad. Only in this way, can the railway construction well adapt to the local economic development.","Carrying capacity; Economy; Railway","Comparison and analysis; Construction standards; Economy; Local economic development; Railway; Railway transportation; Transportation demand; Transportation development; Behavioral research; Economic analysis; Electric current carrying capacity (cables); Railroad transportation; Research; Railroads",,,,,"Qi, A., (2009) Project Proof and Evaluation, , Second Edition.

It demonstrates the problem setting that all three authors share: how did fear, as given in the mental foresight that appeared along the evolutionary step of becoming human, contribute to the foundation of the moral-religious, as well as political, phenomena? It points out that whereas Bergson and Bibó consider the Christian culture that evolved from Roman imperial heritage as the only all-human solution of how to organize society, Hofstede has already drawn the consequence, after the empirical research into the value systems of several dozen national cultures, that an equal, or perhaps from a future perspective even more promising alternative of this, is the Chinese culture-type with its value system, disparate from Western one. It reminds us that whereas one of the main dimensions of Western value system, originating from the Romans, is uncertainty avoidance, the high-intensity variation type of which is characteristic of Mediterranean countries (also including us Hungarians), and the low variation is represented, besides Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians, exactly by China and the countries having a more significant Chinese population, in the intensity grades of the research dimension emerging from the empirical examination of these latter; that is, long-term orientation (frugality and being governed by ortho-praxis instead of ortho-doxy), the weak Anglo-Saxon culture, and in a marginal negative value, the culture of the US is situated at the pole opposite a strong China. One of the latent characteristics - a counter-intuitive one which could only be brought to the surface empirically - is religious, political, and economic fundamentalism, which strives to avoid responsibility for the future by placing it into the hands of God or market forces. Some consequences from the confrontation of the ""three wise men"" will be presented in the second part of the study.","condition humaine; disparate value systems; fear; long-term orientation; problem-solving partnership; uncertainty avoidance",,,,,,"Ádám, A., (2009) A Magyar Alkotmányos Jogállam Fejlesztési Lehetségei, pp. 423-440. , Társadalomkutatás 27 (2009) 4; Balog, I., (2010) Bibó István Recepciója: Politikai Átértelmezések, , Argumentum Kiadó, Budapest; Bergson, H., (1990) Id És Szabadság, , Univerzum reprint, Szeged; Bergson, H., (2002) Az Erkölcs És A Vallás Két Forrása, , Szent István Társulat, Budapest; Bibó, I., A kelet-európai kisállamok nyomorúsága (1986) Bibó I.: Válogatott Tanulmányok II, pp. 185-265. , Magvet Könyvkiadó, Budapest; Bibó, I., Az európai társadalomfejldés értelme (1986) Bibó I.: Válogatott Tanulmányok III, pp. 5-123. , Magvet Könyvkiadó, Budapest; Csizmadia, E., A politikai program fogalmáról és értelmezésérl: Bevezetés az október 23-a utáni vitákhoz (2012) Élet És Irodalom, Október, 31, p. 3; Eyal, G., Szelényi, I., Townsley, E., (2000) Making Capitalism Without Capitalists: The New Ruling Elites in Eastern Europe, , http://books.google.hu/booksid=TCjKsL4HxIsC&printsec=frontcover#v= onepage&q&f=false, Verso, London-New York. a href= Letöltés ideje: 2013 03 20; Eyal, G., Szelényi, I., Townsley, E., On Irony: An invitation to neo-classical sociology (2003) Thesis Eleven.

Even though it is not explicit in many projects, we especially value research that is still relevant five, ten or more years after it is completed. However, published research in the field of interactive computing (and technology research in general) often lacks evidence of systematic thinking about the long-term impacts of current trends. For example, trends on an exponential curve change much more rapidly than intuition predicts. As a result, research may accidentally emphasize nearterm thinking. When thinking about the future is approached systematically, we can critically examine multiple potential futures, expand the set of externalities under consideration, and address both negative and positive forecasts of the future. The field of Futures Studies provides methods that can support analysis of long-term trends, support the identification of new research areas and guide design and evaluation. We survey methods for futuristic thinking and discuss their relationship to Human Computer Interaction. Using the sustainability domain an example, we present a case study of a Futures Studies approach-the Delphi Method. We show how Futures Studies can be incorporated into Human Computer Interaction and highlight future work such as rethinking the role of externalities in the validation process.

Operating conditions of such a combination are optimized by Differential Evolution (DE) method to maximize main products yield. In this regard, thirteen and eleven decision variables such as length per diameter (LOD) of the tubular membrane reactor, hydraulic diameter, membrane thickness, catalyst mass distribution, etc. are optimized for a combination of one or two tubular membrane reactors with two or one spherical reactor. Eight possible combinations are optimized. The optimization results show that the configuration of spherical-tubular membrane-spherical reactor (SMS) performs well among all the other ones. A considerable increase in aromatic (8.01%) and hydrogen (9.81%) production rates in addition to desirable pressure and temperature profiles are achieved in optimized SMS configuration. Experiments and cost evaluation of SMS should be supplemented to such a theoretical investigation as a future work to have an entire foresight for future plant designs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the effect of delays in consumers responding to price signals on the benefits of demand response in mitigating wind-uncertainty costs. Using a case study based on the ERCOT power system, we compare the cost of operating the system with forecasts of future wind availability to a best-case scenario with perfect foresight of wind. We demonstrate that wind uncertainty can impose substantive costs on the system and that demand response can eliminate more than 75% of these costs if loads respond to system conditions immediately. Otherwise, we find that with a 30-min lag in the response, nearly 72% of the value of demand response is lost. © 2013 IEEE.","Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Wind forecast errors; Wind power generation","Effect of delays; Perfect foresights; Power system economics; Real time pricing; System conditions; Unit commitment; Wind forecasts; Wind uncertainties; Economics; Electric power generation; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Costs",,,,,"DeMeo, E.A., Grant, W., Milligan, M.R., Schuerger, M.J., Wind plant integration (2005) IEEE Power and Energy Mag., 3, pp. 38-46. , Nov.-Dec; Smith, J.C., Milligan, M.R., DeMeo, E.A., Parsons, B., Utility wind integration and operating impact state of the art (2007) IEEE Trans.

Using tax policies as a leading example of foresight, simple theory makes transparent the economic behavior and information structures that generate non-fundamental equilibria. Econometric analyses that fail to model foresight will obtain biased estimates of output multipliers for taxes; biases are quantitatively important when two canonical theoretical models are taken as data generating processes. Both the nature of equilibria and the inferences about the effects of anticipated tax changes hinge critically on hypothesized information flows. Different methods for extracting or hypothesizing the information flows are discussed and shown to be alternative techniques for resolving a non-uniqueness problem endemic to moving average representations. © 2013 The Econometric Society.","Anticipated taxes; Identified VARs; News; Non-fundamental representation",,,,,,"Abel, A.B., Dynamic Effects of Permanent and Temporary Tax Policies in a q Model of Investment (1982) Journal of Monetary Economics, 9 (3), pp. 353-373. , DOI: 10.1016/0304-3932(82)90023-X; An, S., Schorfheide, F., Bayesian Analysis of DSGE Models (2007) Econometric Reviews, 26 (2), pp. 113-172. , DOI: 10.1080/07474930701220071; Ang, A., Bhansali, V., Xing, Y., Taxes on Tax-Exempt Bonds (2010) Journal of Finance, 65 (2), pp. 565-601; Auerbach, A.J., Tax Reform and Adjustment Costs: The Impact on Investment and Market Value (1989) International Economic Review, 30 (4), pp. 939-962. , DOI: 10.2307/2526760; Barsky, R., Sims, E., News Shocks and Business Cycles (2011) Journal of Monetary Economics, 58 (3), pp. 273-289. , DOI: 10.1016/j.jmoneco.2011.03.001; Beaudry, P., Portier, F., Stock Prices, News, and Economic Fluctuations (2006) American Economic Review, 96 (4), pp. 1293-1307. , DOI: 10.1257/aer.96.4.1293; Bernanke, B.S., Alternative Explanations of the Money-Income Correlation (1986) Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 25, pp. 49-99; Blanchard, O.J., Perotti, R., An Empirical Characterization of the Dynamic Effects of Changes in Government Spending and Taxes on Output (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (4), pp. 1329-1368. , DOI: 10.1162/003355302320935043; Blanchard, O.J., Quah, D., The Dynamic Effects of Aggregate Demand and Supply Disturbances (1989) American Economic Review, 79 (4), pp. 655-673; Blattner, T., Catenaro, M., Ehrmann, M., Strauch, R., Turunen, J., (2008), ""The Predictability of Monetary Policy,"" Occasional Paper 83, European Central Bank, March; Burnside, C., Eichenbaum, M., Fisher, J.D.M., Fiscal Shocks and Their Consequences (2004) Journal of Economic Theory, 115 (1), pp. 89-117. , DOI: 10.1016/S0022-0531(03)00252-7; Canova, F., (2002), Validating Monetary DSGE Models Through VARs,"" Discussion Paper 3442, Centre for Economic Policy Research, July; Chari, V.V., Kehoe, P.J., McGrattan, E.R., Are Structural VARs With Long-Run Restrictions Useful in Developing Business Cycle Theory?

We discuss foresight as a system of inquiry into decision-making problems characterized by three key features - distancing, holism, and participation-intensiveness. We put forward the hypothesis that participative approaches to normative scenario development, which are structurally similar to a Rawlsian ""original position"" setup, generate a concern with the procedural arrangements governing the future world in the scenario, rather than simply with the events or states in the story of the future. This concern with ""constitutional basics"" may be regarded as an expression of participants' attempt to ensure that, in the future world, each party will have a seat at the table and a voice in the conversation. As a result, the construction of normative narratives may be interpreted in terms of an effort to smooth out tensions that are inevitably embedded in scenarios. The hypothesis is illustrated, in the article's final section, with a recent exercise on the future of higher education. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Consensus; Deliberative democracy; Holism; Normative scenario; Original position; Participation; System foresight","Consensus; Deliberative democracy; Holism; Normative scenarios; Original position; Participation; System foresight; Technological forecasting; Innovation; decision making; future prospect; governance approach; higher education; holistic approach; hypothesis testing",,,,,"Andreescu, L., Gheorghiu, R., Zulean, M., Curaj, A., System foresight for Romanian higher education (2012) European Higher Education at the Crossroads: Between the Bologna Process and National Reforms, , Springer, Dordrecht, A.

Consistent with the classical rational choice paradigm, our theory requires that endogenous expectations be replaced with a general-measurable function of the observable states of the model, to be determined optimally. This forecasting function is derived as the regime-independent feedback control minimizing the mean-square deviation of the equilibrium path from the corresponding perfect-foresight state motion (the reference model). We show that model reference adaptive expectations always generate a rational expectations equilibrium, irrespective of the presence of nonlinearities and/or imperfect information. Under equilibrium indeterminacy, this forecasting mechanism enforces the unique mean-square stable solution producing nearly perfect-foresight dynamics. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic programming; Markov-switching dynamic systems; Rational expectations; Time-varying Kalman filter",,,,,,"Abou-Kandil, H., Freilings, G., Jank, G., On the solution of discrete-time Markovian linear quadratic control problems (1995) Automatica, 31, pp. 765-768; Andolfatto, D., Gomme, P., Monetary policy regimes and beliefs (2003) International Economic Review, 44, pp. 1-30; Basar, T., Some thoughts on rational expectations models and alternate formulations (1989) Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 18, pp. 591-604; Blair, W.P., Sworder, D.D., Feedback control of a class of linear discrete systems with jump parameters and quadratic cost criteria (1975) International Journal of Control, 21, pp. 833-841; Blanchard, O.J., Kahn, C., The solution of linear difference models under rational expectations (1980) Econometrica, 48, pp. 1305-1311; Branch, W.A., Davig, T., McGough, B., Adaptive Learning in Regime-Switching Models (2007) FRB of Kansas City RWP No. 07-09; Bullard, J., Suda, J., The Stability of Macroeconomic Systems with Bayesian Learners (2008) FRB of St. Louis WP No. 2008-043B; Carravetta, F., Sorge, M.M., A ""nearly ideal"" solution to linear time-varying rational expectations models (2010) Computational Economics, 35, pp. 331-353; Chizeck, H.J., Ji, Y., Optimal Quadratic Control of Jump Linear Systems with Gaussian Noise in Discrete-time (1988) Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 1989-1992; Chizeck, H.J., Willsky, A.S., Castanon, D., Discrete-time Markovian-jump linear quadratic optimal control (1986) International Journal of Control, 43, pp. 213-231; Collard, F., Dellas, H., The New Keynesian Model with Imperfect Information and Learning (2004) IDEI Working Paper No. 273; Costa, O., Fragoso, M., Marques, R., (2005) Discrete-Time Markov Jump Linear Systems, , Springer, New York; Davig, T., Regime-switching debt and taxation (2004) Journal of Monetary Economics, 51, pp. 837-859; Davig, T., Leeper, E.M., Generalizing the Taylor principle (2007) American Economic Review, 97, pp. 607-635; De Santis, A., Germani, A., Scoglio, C., Kalman filter approach to solution of rational expectations models (1993) Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 25, pp. 39-47; Driskill, R., Multiple equilibria in dynamic rational expectations models: a critical review (2006) European Economic Review, 50, pp. 171-210; Evans, G.W., Honkapohja, S., (2001) Learning and Expectations in Macroeconomics, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Evans, G.W., McGough, B., Monetary policy, indeterminacy, and learning (2005) Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 29, pp. 1809-1840; Farmer, R.E.A., Why does data reject the Lucas Critique?

How can France, often presented as a case of cultural exceptionalism, come to terms with the three major dynamics affecting culture in the broad sense: the digital shift, globalization and the rise of individualism? How can the Ministry of Culture and its associated policies adapt to these changes, while also taking account of the changes in cultural practices? Philippe Chantepie, who coordinated this enormous foresight and strategic exercise, reports its main findings here. He begins by presenting the factors and components of the cultural system that provided the basis for identifying four possible future scenarios for culture and the media up to 2030 (""Continued Exceptionalism"", ""The Cultural Market"", ""The Creative Imperative"" and ""The Culture of Identities""), together with 20 issues ensuing from these. Then, taking this diagnosis into account, he explains the strategic orientations to be envisaged by the Ministry of Culture and Communication in its organization and in the policies it puts in place in the years to 2020. The aim must now be to take account of the profound change of context at the national, European and world levels, and of the changes in practices which are going to intensify as new generations come on the scene, and to adapt to these while taking account of the new actors intervening in the cultural field, preserving the legitimacy of a policy and innovating in the three major fields of activity which it covers: namely, artistic creation, heritage, and the cultural industries and media.",,,,,,,"(2011) Culture & Médias 2030.

Although many studies emphasised the importance of collaboration in this industry, very few relied on considerable data to explore its timing. We focus on the emerging field of biopharmaceuticals, the RNA interference (RNAi) drugs, and longitudinally analysed relevant published data on worldwide pre-market collaboration. It is revealed that there are boundaries between independence and external collaboration in the firms and the entire field. Firms, after converting their initial product designs into concrete drug candidates, collaborated with external organisations to strengthen their future competitiveness. Collaboration shifted technologies toward the downstream of the value chain. These results suggest that foresight into future needs and problems will help encourage competitiveness. Currently, however, Japanese organisations would pursue collaboration to enter into the new field. As an industry, it is necessary to consider what activity could link to its future competitiveness. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","biopharmaceuticals; biotechnology; collaboration; competitiveness; R&D","biotechnology; competitiveness; pharmaceutical industry; research and development; Japan",,,,,"Audretsch, D.B., Feldman, M.P., Small-firm strategic research partnerships: The case of biotechnology (2003) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 15, pp. 273-288. , doi:10.1080/0953732032000051154; Bianchi, M., Cavaliere, A., Chiaroni, D., Flattini, F., Chiesa, V., Organisational modes for open innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry: An exploratory analysis (2010) Technovation, 31, pp. 22-33. , doi:10.1016/j.technovation.2010.03.002; Calero, C., Van Leeuwen, T.N., Tijssen, R.J.W., Research cooperation within the biopharmaceutical industry: Network analyses of co-publications within and between firms (2007) Scientometrics, 71, pp. 87-99. , doi:10.1007/s11192-007-1650-y; Chiaroni, D., Chiesa, V., Frattini, F., Unravelling the process from closed to open innovation: Evidence from mature, asset-intensive industries (2010) R&D Management, 40, pp. 222-245; Cohen, W.M., Goto, A., Nagata, A., Nelson, R.R., Walsh, J.P., R&D spillovers, patents and the incentives to innovate in Japan and the United States (2002) Research Policy, 31, pp. 1349-1367. , doi:10.1016/S0048-7333(02)00068-9; Fire, A.Z., Xu, S., Montgomery, M.K., Kostas, S.A., Driver, S.E., Mello, C.C., Potent and specific genetic interference by double-stranded RNA in (1998) Caenorhabditis elegans.

There is a downside of this kind of progress, however. Computers are not 100% reliable. They are insecure. They are vulnerable to attackers. They can either be attacked directly, to disrupt their services, or they can be abused in clever ways to do the bidding of an attacker as a dysfunctional user. Decision-makers and experts alike always struggle with the amount of interdisciplinary knowledge needed to understand the nuts and bolts of modern information societies and their relation to security, the implications of technological or political progress or the lack thereof. This holds in particular for new challenges to come. These are harder to understand and to categorize; their development is difficult to predict. To mitigate this problem and to enable more foresight, The Secure Information Society provides an interdisciplinary spotlight onto some new and unfolding aspects of the uneasy relationship between information technology and information society, to aid the dialogue not only in its current and ongoing struggle, but to anticipate the future in time and prepare perspectives for the challenges ahead. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

We suggest that this mystique-the way some managers are perceived by observers-arises from the intuitive logic that psychologists and anthropologists call magical thinking. Consistent with this account, Study 1 found that perceptions of a manager's mystique are associated with judgments of his or her charismatic vision and ability to forecast future business trends. The authors hypothesized that mystique arises especially when success is observed in the absence of mechanical causes, such as long hours or hard-won skills. In Study 2, managers who succeeded mysteriously rather than mechanically evoked participants' attributions of foresight and their expectations of success at visionary tasks yet not at administrative tasks. The authors further hypothesized that as mystique is assumed to spread through contagion, observers desire physical contact with managers who are attributed mystique and with these managers' possessions. Study 3 found that managers described as visionary as opposed to diligent are judged to be charismatic and ultimately magnetic. The authors discuss the implications of these judgment patterns for the literatures on perception biases and impression management in organizations. © The Author(s) 2011.","attribution; contagion; mystique; vision",,,,,,"(2006) Personalities, , http://www.answers.com/topic/lebron-james, Answers.com. n.d, Retrieved December 22,from; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Bass, B.M., (1985) Leadership and Performance beyond Expectations, , New York: Free Press; Bass, B.M., (1988) Charismatic Leadership: The Elusive Factor in Organizational Effectiveness, pp. 40-77. , Conger J.

We contribute to this field by showing the development and implementation of a tailored scenario process for innovation management that has been implemented at a leading global manufacturer of high performance materials for their innovation field of future logistics. Our demonstration includes all phases from visualisation of contextual scenarios to market scenarios of target groups to new product concepts and finally concrete business models. In order to increase the innovation capacity in the scenario process we integrated a Delphi-expert survey, participatory workshops and an open network approach. The scope of our scenarios was global in nature as were the nationalities of the experts that took part in our innovation-focused scenario process. Represented countries included among others European countries, BRIC States and the USA. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi; Design; Dynaxibility; Innovation; Logistics; Scenario process; Visualisation","Delphi; Dynaxibility; High performance material; Innovation management; Participatory workshops; Proactive management; Scenario process; Sustainable performance; Competition; Design; Industry; Logistics; Visualization; Innovation; competitiveness; Delphi analysis; innovation; numerical model; visualization; Europe",,,,,"Killen, C.P., Hunt, R.A., Kleinschmidt, E.J., Project portfolio management for product innovation (2008) Int.

Methodology: The main methods of optimization of enterprise's business portfolio in context of strategic flexibility support are: investment portfolio formation model, economic analysis, mathematical statistics and prognostication. Findings: We have defined the phases of formation process and support mechanism of strategic flexibility of an enterprise and substantiated the necessity of an enterprise business portfolio restricting in context of strategic flexibility support. Originality: The forming of strategic flexibility of an enterprise is proposed to consider as a continuous process that consists of four phases: foresight, statement, accumulation and realization. The mechanism of enterprise's strategic flexibility support in terms of enterprise's business portfolio optimization with using the modification of Markowitz's model of forming investment portfolio is described in the article. Practical value: We have suggested the optimal business portfolio structure of DP ""Avtosborochnyi zavod No. 2"" of AO ""Automobile Company ""Bogdan Motors"" in terms of risks minimization.

The study conducts as both qualitative and quantitative methods with experts in alternative studies and human resource development in all fields. The analyses indicate that the global megatrends which will affect Thailand in the year 2021 are: aging society, urbanization, emerging infectious diseases, food insecurity, competition in technological development, world crude oil prices volatility, snatching natural resources, economic powerhouse of East Asia, global warming, climate change, regulations and good governance on environment. Thailand's chronic problems are social inequality, unsustainable country development and education separated from learners' way of life. The role of alternative educators in Thai social reform are to develop the new education system, fulfill the quality for Thai education and develop the learners who can effectively live and cope with the global megatrends. As a result, the desirable characteristics of alternative educators in Thai social reform are 21st century skills, knowledge in education and human resource development, professional skills, morality, leadership, thinking skills and personal characteristics. The development model for the desirable characteristics of alternative educators should be realistic, holistic and flexible for each philosophy of alternative studies.

First, the history of crude oil prices and energy trends are presented. By evaluating empirical findings and introducing a representative agent model with perfect foresight, the second part of the paper discusses how the 2007-2008 price shock could have been driven purely by changes in market fundamentals. The last part of the paper takes advantage of the fact that all price innovations enter the unified world market for crude oil from the Dubai-Fateh spot price and the price of WTI far-month futures contract. It does so by utilising DOLS estimation to determine R-values which identifies periods of cointegration breakdown and analysing the direction of causality by applying an error correction model during these periods. The paper concludes that the 2007-2008 boom and bust in prices was instigated by changes in fundamentals which were in turn amplified by hedgers and speculators.

Reflections on my experience are based on handling field crop breeding and direct contacts with some distinguished plant breeders and some great people managers. By writing this article, I hope to share information on key success factors for developing and releasing new cultivars. The reflections also include other issues that can enable breeders at seed companies to have a competitive edge. The ultimate challenge for a plant breeder is releasing an elite cultivar. The key success factors for a successful crop breeding program are: (i) having a highly capable breeder with adequate technical competency; (ii) understanding the crop and the key customer requirements; (iii) having adequate genetic variability; (iv) having an elite heterotic pattern for hybrid; (v) using the most efficient breeding methodologies; (vi) selecting right breeding environments; (vii) developing an adequate and effective testing system; (viii) speeding to release new hybrids into a market, and recently (ix) having adequate information technology and DNA marker lab support. Close linkage of research and development team with commercial team will ensure breeding directions are aligned with meeting customer requirements. Key success factors for the seed business are: understanding the seed market and key customer requirements, designing right products, producing at reasonable cost, commercializing efficiently, delivering products and services, and providing customer service. Appropriate cultural practices for the new product are needed for clearly delivering superior products. The successful breeder normally gets promotion to be the manager of the research organization and may even get further promotion to an even high-ranking position. Effective delegation skills will be needed for a great people manager. Key competency behaviors for the great people manager are people, leadership and management skills, foresight and initiative, communication and candor, relationships and networks, and results orientation. © Society for the Advancement of Breeding Research in Asia and Oceania (SABRAO) 2013.","Competency behaviors; Competitive edge; Crop breeding; DNA marker fingerprinting; Elite cultivar; Genetic variability; Heterotic pattern; Technical competency",,,,,,"Buchingham, M., Coffman, C., (1999) First break all the rules, , Simon and Schuster Inc.

It describes how joint enterprise has become a specific weapon used by the police and the courts to target both political protest and 'gang' violence, in particular in black and working-class communities. The main evidence and recommendations of the House of Commons Justice Committee inquiry into joint enterprise held in 2011 are summarised, with specific reference to how the complexity and inconsistency in application of the law, its use as a dragnet against gangs through police and prosecutorial over-charging, and convictions based on 'foresight' rather than criminal intent, can all lead to miscarriages of justice. The particular problems associated with the use of joint enterprise in relation to murder are described. The article concludes by examining the response of the UK authorities to the Justice Committee report, with specific reference to new draft prosecutorial guidance issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, which fails to clarify the law and in fact confirms the need for new legislation in this area.

It is often assumed that such changes are introduced responsibly only if we act with foresight, by striving to predict the consequences of what we do. This characteristically modern consequentialist position is, nonetheless, inappropriate. Part of the technological condition is how the future is being constituted through innovation, meaning that past predictions will often be wrong, and sometimes spectacularly so. The unforeseeable consequences of innovation result in moral uncertainty that is uniquely characteristic of technological societies, which leaves one wondering whether ethical questions on a radically novel horizon can be addressed at all. We answer in the affirmative by arguing that, if the technological situation is unique, the ways to understand the contemporary moral condition are not. We link it to age-old questions of human finitude: in fact, the power promised by technology only establishes a new form of finitude. In the face of this continuity of the fundamental moral condition, we examine a number of alternative ways of thinking about the basis of responsible innovation, exploring the appropriateness of metaphors of quasi-parental care and collective political responsibility, as well as the place of virtue in innovation and the role of cultural narratives in helping us understand the limits of responsible innovation. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Care; Collective responsibility; Consequentialism; Finitude; Frankenstein; Golem; Narrative; Uncertainty; Virtue",,,,,,"Adam, B., Timescapes of Modernity: The Environment and Invisible Hazards (1998), London: Routledge; Adam, B., Groves, C., Future Matters: Action, Knowledge, Ethics (2007), Leiden: Brill; Arendt, H., Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil (1963), New York: Penguin Books; Arendt, H., The Human Condition (1958), Chicago: Chicago University Press, (2nd edn); Arendt, H., Collective responsibility (1968), H.

Each of these ADAS can rely on a multitude of environmental sensors, which creates the need of cross-linking ADAS with respect to their access to environment information. This idea is reflected in the so-called environment model (EM) that centralizes the access of all ADAS functions to the perceived but not yet interpreted scene in the vehicle environment. In this paper, we propose an architectural framework that concretizes the EM in terms of separate modules for signal processing and sensor data fusion, as well as well-defined generic input and output interfaces. Moreover, we extend the EM by including additional components and output interfaces for centralized scene interpretation (CSI). The architectural framework allows streamlining the development process and increasing computational efficiency, as software modules for scene interpretation can be shared among multiple ADAS. In addition, the consistency of the overall ADAS behavior is improved, as all ADAS functions rely on the same scene information and scene interpretation. We illustrate our concept of centralized scene interpretation using the case study of a module for the detection of directional roadways, a generalization of motorways. The algorithm we present analyzes multiple perceptual indicators in favor or against a directional roadway and computes an overall decision, along with a foresight value for the expected duration of the directional roadway, to be used in various ADAS functions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Directional roadway detection; Driver assistance systems; Environment model; Scene interpretation; System architecture","Architectural frameworks; Development process; Driver assistance system; Environment information; Environment models; Environmental sensor; Scene interpretation; System architectures; Sensor data fusion; Signal processing; Automobile safety devices",,,,,"BMW AG Active PDC and Remote Controlled Parking, , http://www.connecteddrive.info/index.php?option=com-content&view= article&id=76, Accessed on 31/05/2012; Schaller, T., (2009) Congestion Assistance-supporting the Driver in Lateral and Longitudinal Guidance in Congestion Situations, , Dissertation at Technical University of Munich, Garching, 2009; BMW AG Traffic Jam and Queuing Assistant, , http://www.connecteddrive.info/index.php?option=com-content&view= article&id=73, Accessed on 31/05/2012; BMW AG Lateral Collision Avoidance, , http://www.connecteddrive.info/index.php?option=com-content&view= article&id=70, Accessed on 05/31/2012; Hörwick, M., (2011) Safety Concept for Highly Automated Driver Assistance Systems, , Dissertation at Technical University of Munich, Garching, 2011; Holder, S., Hörwick, M., Gentner, H., Funktionsübergreifende Szeneninterpretation zur Vernetzung von Fahrerassistenzsystemen (2012) Braunschweiger Symposium Automatisierungssysteme, Assistenzsysteme und Eingebettete Systeme für Transportmittel (AAET); Maurer, M., (2000) Flexible Automatisierung von Straßenfahrzeugen Mit Rechnersehen, , Dissertation at University of Bundeswehr München, Neubiberg, 2000; Schöttle, M., Zukunft der Fahrerassistenz mit neuen E/E-Architekturen (2011) ATZ Elektronik, 4/2011; Tsogas, M., Polychronopoulos, A., Amditis, A., Using digital maps to enhance lane keeping support systems (2007) IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Istanbul, 2007; Gackstatter, C., Heinemann, P., Thomas, S., Rosenhahn, B., Klinker, G., Fusion of clothoid segments for a more accurate and updated prediction of the road geometry (2010) IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), Madeira, 2010; Stählin, U., Schorn, M., Isermann, R., Notausweichen für ein Fahrerassistenzsystem zur Unfallvermeidung (2006) Wiesloch, Fachtagung Steuerung und Regelung von Kraftfahrzeugen und Verbrennungsmotoren (AUTOREG)","Hörwick, M.; BMW AG, Munich, Germany",,"China FAW Group Corporation;Das Auto;Audi;BMW Group;Toyota",,"FISITA 2012 World Automotive Congress","27 November 2012 through 30 November 2012","Beijing",96284,18761100,9783642338373,,,"English","Lect.

Although to different extents, both instruments procedurally and methodologically rely on participatory procedures for anticipation. Building on the analytical concepts of co-production and boundary work, we analyze the practices of participatory knowledge production in ten technology assessment and foresight projects in Austria. In the first step, we examine the conceptualization and realization of participation by identifying their underlying rationales. In the second step, we show how different rationales influence the selection of participants and their interactions. We then show how particular actors and related role expectations are assigned to specific modes of anticipation. Finally, we highlight the covert domination of experts and project managers in the overall framing of problems and the challenges that they face when their framings are questioned by other participants. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Institute of Local Government Studies, University of Birmingham.","anticipatory knowledge; foresight; participation; technology assessment",,,,,,"Beck, U., (1986) Risikogesellschaft: Auf dem Weg in eine andere Moderne, , Frankfurt, Frankfurt,: Suhrkamp; Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of futures studies - Vol. 1: History, purposes and knowledge, , New Brunswick, NJ, New Brunswick, NJ,: Transaction Publishers; Bogner, A., Menz, W., The theory-generating expert interview: epistemological interest, forms of knowledge, interaction (2009) Interviewing experts, pp. 43-80. , In: Bogner A., Littig B., Menz W., editors Basingstoke, Basingstoke,: Palgrave Macmillan; Börjeson, L., (2005) Towards a user's guide to scenarios - a report on scenario types and scenario techniques, , Stockholm, Stockholm,: Royal Institute of Technology; Dreborg, K.-H., (2004) Scenarios and structural uncertainty: Exploration in the field of sustainable transport, , Stockholm, Stockholm,: Royal Institute of Technology; Funtowicz, S.O., Ravetz, J.R., Science for the post-normal age (1993) Futures, 25 (7), pp. 739-755; Gavigan, J., (2001) A practical guide to regional foresight: FOREN Network (Foresight for Regional Development), , Brussels,: European Commission Research Directorate General; Gibbons, M., (1994) The new production of knowledge: The dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies, , London, London,: Sage; Giddens, A., (1984) The constitution of society: Outline of the theory of structuration, , Berkeley, CA, Berkeley, CA,: University of California Press; Gieryn, T.F., Boundaries of science (1995) Handbook of science and technology studies, pp. 393-443. , In: S.

We show that addictive substances are more likely to have state-dependent solution trajectories, and that in turn can create path dependence at the macro-policy level; in particular, legalization may be an irreversible experiment. Also, in this model, shifting from a nuanced policy that differentiates between high and low intensity users, to a tougher one where the government makes life hard for every user reduces initiation considerably. However, it also may have perverse effects. In particular, we show that making the policy tougher in this way could drive some people from a ""happy"" stable saddle point equilibrium with moderate consumption into increasing rather than reducing their consumption and addiction stock. So implementing zero tolerance policies may increase rather than reduce aggregate drug use, depending on the population's distribution of parameter values and initial consumption stocks. Further, we consider the impact of announcing a policy change. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite continued claims for more inter-disciplinary approaches, progress to date has been slow. This paper elaborates on the need for innovation in methodologies and knowledge, on the one hand, and methods and data, on the other, to build the foundations for dealing with the challenges from global change. Three questions related to the nature of global change, the dynamics of sustainability transitions and the role of human agency guide analyses on the state of the art, barriers for innovation and need for action. The analyses build on literature reviews, expert workshops and surveys which were conducted under the umbrella of RESCUE, a foresight activity funded by the European Science Foundation. The major recommendations focus on integrating environmental and human dimensions, bridging scales, data and knowledge for global change research and overcoming structural constraints to make global change research more policy relevant. © 2012.","Data and knowledge; Global change; Innovation; Methodologies; Methods","article; climate change; environmental factor; global change; human; knowledge; methodology; policy; priority journal; research; socioeconomics",,,,,"Allison, I., Bindoff, N., Bindschadler, R., (2009) The Copenhagen Diagnosis: Updating the World on the Latest Climate Science, , University of New South Wales Climate Research Centre, Australia, Sydney; (1994) Globalization, Institutions, and Regional Development in Europe, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, A.

Their collaboration reveals how the shared identification of uncertainty as a major problem, their similar interpretation of rationality as the ability to select and use relevant information, and their embrace of certain methodological norms for the construction of economic theory (that it should be empirically grounded and mathematically sophisticated) enabled productive cross-fertilization between the two approaches in their nascent forms. In the beginning Modigliani's forward-looking procedure (with its focus on foresight) and Simon's backward-looking model (with its focus on learning) were conceived as complementary rather than antithetical for the development of a concrete decision rule under the hypothesis of incomplete information. The article also discusses Modigliani's and Emile Grunberg's contribution to rational expectations, concentrating on the paper they wrote but never published, and Modigliani's early reaction to John Muth's rational expectations theory. © 2013 by Duke University Press.",,,,,,,"Ando, A., Modigliani, F., The 'Life Cycle' Hypothesis of Saving Behavior: Aggregate Implications and Tests (1963) American Economic Review, 53 (MARCH), pp. 55-84; Augier, M., March, G., (2004) Models of a Man: Essays in Memory of Herbert A.

The femto-access points (FAPs) and the macro-base stations (MBSs) in the network are assumed to compete with each other to maximize their capacity under power constraints. This competition is captured in the framework of a Stackelberg game with the MBSs as the leaders and the FAPs as the followers. The leaders are assumed to have foresight enough to consider the responses of the followers while formulating their own strategies. The Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced as the solution of the Stackelberg game, and it is shown to exist under some mild assumptions. The game is expressed as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), and the best response for a one leader-multiple follower game is derived. The best response is also obtained when a quality-of-service constraint is placed on the leader. Orthogonal power allocation between leader and followers is obtained as a special case of this solution under high interference. These results are used to build algorithms to iteratively calculate the Stackelberg equilibrium, and a sufficient condition is given for its convergence. The performance of the system at a Stackelberg equilibrium is found to be much better than that at a Nash equilibrium. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Femtocell; game theory; interference channel; leader-follower game; Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraint (MPEC); OFDMA cellular network; power control; Stackelberg equilibrium","Cellular network; Interference channels; Leader-follower games; Mathematical program with equilibrium constraints; Stackelberg equilibrium; Beamforming; Femtocell; Game theory; Iterative methods; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Power control; Quality of service; Telecommunication networks; Frequency division multiple access",,,,,"Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Gatherer, A., Femtocell networks: A survey (2008) IEEE Commun.

The ability to make accurate and timely predictions enhances our ability to control our situation and our environment. Assistive robotics is one prominent area in which foresight of this kind can bring improved quality of life. In this article, we present a new approach to acquiring and maintaining predictive knowledge during the online ongoing operation of an assistive robot. The ability to learn accurate, temporally abstracted predictions is shown through two case studies: 1) able-bodied myoelectric control of a robot arm and 2) an amputees interactions with a myoelectric training robot. To our knowledge, this research is the first demonstration of a practical method for real-time prediction learning during myoelectric control. Our approach therefore represents a fundamental tool for addressing one major unsolved problem: amputee-specific adaptation during the ongoing operation of a prosthetic device. The findings in this article also contribute a first explicit look at prediction learning in prosthetics as an important goal in its own right, independent of its intended use within a specific controller or system. Our results suggest that real-time learning of predictions and anticipations is a significant step toward more intuitive myoelectric prostheses and other assistive robotic devices. © 1994-2011 IEEE.",,"Assistive robotics; Fundamental tools; Myoelectric control; Myoelectric prosthesis; Prosthetic devices; Real-time learning; Real-time prediction; Unsolved problems; Artificial limbs; Robotics; Forecasting",,,,,"Peerdeman, B., Boere, D., Witteveen, H., Veld, R.H., Hermens, H., Stramigioli, S., Rietman, H., Misra, S., Myoelectric forearm prostheses: State of the art from a user-centered perspective (2011) J.

The call for new regulatory approaches stems from several challenges that traditional approaches have difficulties dealing with. These challenges relate to general problems of governability, tensions between public interests, but also (and maybe particularly) to almost complete lack of certainty about the implications of nanotechnologies. At the same time, the field of nanotechnology can be characterized by a high level of diversity. In this paper, we discuss and compare two models for framing public policy in relation to technology regulation: the first is a deliberative model based on foresight knowledge and the second the wide reflective equilibrium model, developed by political philosopher John Rawls. In both models, the aim is to find consensus on (a framework for) policy measures and regulation. On the basis of a critical discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of both models, some tentative conclusions are drawn for effective policy making and implementation based on soft law. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Consensus; Deliberative democracy; Governance; Regulation; Regulatory challenges; Soft law; Wide reflective equilibrium",,,,,,"Allhoff, F., On the autonomy and justification of nanoethics (2007) NanoEthics, 1, pp. 185-210; Amtenbrink, F., De Haan, J., Economic governance in the EU: fiscal policy discipline versus flexibility (2003) Common Mark Law Rev, 40, pp. 1075-1106; Benn, T.M., Westerhoff, P., Nanoparticle silver released into water from commercially available sock fabrics (2008) Environ Sci Technol, 42, pp. 4133-4139; Blaser, S.A., Estimation of cumulative aquatic exposure and risk due to silver: contribution of nanofunctionalized plastics and textiles (2008) Sci Total Environ, 390, pp. 396-409; Bowman, D.M., Hodge, G.A., Counting on codes: an examination of transnational codes as a regulatory governance mechanism for nanotechnologies (2009) Regul Gov, 3, pp. 145-164; Bullis, K., (2005) Can EPA regulate nano?

Experiences from a foresight project exploring future innovation patterns (www.innovation-futures.org) are discussed. Four specific features were applied in order to underpin the recognition of structural transformation:.Inductive foresight approach with an emphasis on capturing indications for extra-systemic change at a micro level instead of extrapolating seemingly dominant macro-trends. Visual inspiration, to mobilise tacit knowledge, support a creative spirit and an easy exchange of ideas among people with different disciplinary backgrounds. Rigorous assessment of coverage of dimensions of change, to foster the explicit consideration of possibly unrecognised/hidden structural changes. Extended openness for diversity, to avoid the exclusive interpretation of weak signals only in the context of the existing structures. The findings of the project indicate interesting changes in the nexus of innovation demand and innovation supply. A wide variety of hybrid value creation models with novel configurations of innovation actors emerged. We explain the approach and findings of the project and discuss in particular the implications for foresight methodology. We argue that all four innovative methodological features contributed in a specific way to opening up new perspectives on the future of innovation and potential structural transformation of innovation processes. © 2012.","Foresight methodology; Inductive approach; Innovation pattern; Scenarios; Structural transformation; Vision; Visualisation; Weak signals","Foresight methodology; Inductive approach; Innovation patterns; Scenarios; Structural transformation; Weak signals; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Vision; Visualization; Knowledge management; innovation; knowledge; structural change",,,,,"Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) Tech.

However, the emergence of tablets such as Apple's iPad, has threatened the PC market's prospects and significantly affected Taiwan's PC ecosystem. This study proposes a modified Delphi with end-user participation to provide strategic foresight for firms in Taiwan's PC ecosystem. The results show that these firms can adopt the following three strategies in response to the impact of tablets: (1) brand and service innovation, (2) focus on cloud technology and marketing products to China, and (3) cooperating with digital leisure and entertainment industry. We believe that this modified Delphi with end-user-participation model is a valuable foresight tool for products with a short life cycle, such as consumer electronics and fashion products. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","End-user-participated Delphi; IPad; Strategic foresight; Taiwan's PC ecosystem","Cloud technologies; End-user participations; End-user-participated Delphi; Entertainment industry; IPad; Service innovation; Strategic foresight; Commerce; Consumer electronics; Hand held computers; Industry; Laptop computers; Ecosystems; computer; Delphi analysis; innovation; Taiwan; Malus x domestica",,,,,"Wang, Y.H., (2011) The status of Taiwan's IT industry, , Published:, Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute; Covello, J., Schneider, J., Friar, S., King, H., Takayama, D., Fassler, M.J., Mitchell, J., Schafer, S.F., (2010) The rise of the iPad and tablets: assessing winners and losers in the global TMT ecosystem, , Published:, Goldman Sachs Group Inc; Postma, T., Liebl, F., How to improve scenario analysis as a z tool?

In the past the demand environment for foresight on research and innovation policy favoured application to priority-setting and articulation of demand. New tendencies include a heightened search for breakthrough science and a focus on grand societal challenges. By their nature boundary-spanning, these make it less easy to locate FTA institutionally to achieve the necessary cross-cutting perspective. New institutions, methods and combinations of methods are noted. Dealing with disruptive transformations is seen as the key forward challenge for the practice of FTA. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Disruptive; Foresight; Future-oriented; Grand challenges; Innovation; Transformations","Cross-cutting; Disruptive; Foresight; Future-oriented; Grand Challenge; Innovation policies; New tendencies; Priority setting; Technology analysis; Mathematical transformations; Technological forecasting; Innovation; innovation; research; technological development",,,,,"Porter, A., also cited as Technology Futures Analysis Methods Working Group (2004), 71, pp. 287-303. , Technology Futures Analysis: Towards integration of the field and new methods, Technological Forecasting & Social Change 2004; Scapolo, F., New horizons and challenges for future-oriented technology analysis-the 2004 EU-US seminar (2005) Technol.

The usefulness of this joint method was tested on a core group of stakeholders that would likely be impacted if offshore aquaculture were to be developed in Santa Barbara, California, namely the commercial fishermen. The workshop elicited several scenarios describing stakeholder perceived notions of how offshore aquaculture could impact their industry. This joint method is a new method of developing future scenarios. These can in turn be used to develop more encompassing and interdisciplinary foresight models, early warning systems, for managers in different management areas. Models can thereby include human perception and comprehensive and quantitative scenarios by delimiting the variable paths toward each stakeholder driven scenario as additional elements in a comprehensive policy foresight recommendation tool. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"California; Early Warning System; Human perception; Joint method; Management areas; Management tool; Offshore aquaculture; Policy model; Potential effects; Santa Barbara; Systems thinking; Bayesian networks; Aquaculture; aquaculture; ecological modeling; fishery management; fishing industry; interdisciplinary approach; management practice; numerical model; perception; policy making; stakeholder; California; Santa Barbara [California]; United States",,,,,"Abdallah, P.R., Sumaila, U.R., An historical account of Brazilian public policy on fisheries subsidies (2007) Marine Policy, 31 (4), pp. 444-450; Abreu, M.C.S.D., Mattos, P.D., Shrimp farming in coastal Brazil: reasons for market failure and sustainability challenges (2011) Ocean & Coastal Management, 54 (9), pp. 658-667; Adams, W.M., Brockington, D., Managing tragedies: understanding conflict over common pool resources (2003) Science, 302 (5652), pp. 1915-1916; Antunes Zappes, C., Da Silva, C.V., The conflict between the southern right whale and coastal fisheries on the southern coast of Brazil.""

We show that the planner can lead an economy to an optimum by internalizing the externalities evaluated at current prices and the current population distribution in each period.

It has been developed mainly for model-based decision support. This paper investigates the extent to which EMA is a promising approach for future oriented technology analysis (FTA). We report on three applications of EMA, using different modeling approaches, in three different technical domains. In the first case, EMA is combined with System Dynamics (SD) to study plausible dynamics for mineral and metal scarcity. The main purpose of this combination of EMA and SD is to gain insight into what kinds of surprising dynamics can occur given a variety of uncertainties and a basic understanding of the system. In the second case, EMA is combined with a hybrid model for airport performance calculations to develop an adaptive strategic plan. This case shows how one can iteratively improve a strategic plan through the identification of plausible external conditions that would cause the plan to perform poorly. In the final case, EMA is combined with an agent-based model to study transition dynamics in the electricity sector and identify crucial factors that positively and negatively affect a transition towards more sustainable functioning of the electricity sector. This paper concludes that EMA is useful for generating foresights and studying systemic and structural transformations despite the presence of a plethora of uncertainties, and for designing robust policies and plans, which are key activities of FTA. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptive policymaking; Agent-based modeling; Deep uncertainty; Exploratory Modeling and Analysis; Future-oriented technology analysis; System dynamics","Adaptive policymaking; Agent-based modeling; Deep uncertainties; Modeling and analysis; System Dynamics; Technology analysis; Computational methods; Decision support systems; Electric industry; Iterative methods; Strategic planning; System theory; Uncertainty analysis; numerical model; policy making; strategic approach; technological development; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Porter, A.L.A.W.B., Clar, G., Coates, J.F., Cuhls, K., Cunningham, S.W., Ducatel, K., Van der Duin, P., Thissen, W., Technology futures analysis: towards integration of the field and new methods (2004) Technol.

Building on the UK Foresight Future Flooding project, this paper describes the development of future scenarios through which to assess possible future flood risk in the Taihu Basin area of China. In addition, we describe the flood damage assessment model that was developed there to build on these scenarios so as to calculate anticipated risk. Acknowledged methodological limitations remain, but some important developments have resulted. First, the pre-existing flood loss data that were available from Shanghai meant that this aspect of the risk model's input was more regionally appropriate than would otherwise have been the case. Second, the damage assessment has been related both to constructed scenarios and to an agreed National Plan, so that the two can be compared. Third, the scenario construction was linked in Taihu to the statistical base contained in the 2006 Yearbook and the Fifth National Socio-economic Survey data, giving a sounder 'base case' of current flood vulnerability than used in the UK Foresight Future Flooding project. Finally, much more attention was given here to agricultural production and flood risk, given the importance of agriculture in the Chinese economy and its focus on food production for a growing population. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM).","China; Flood damage; Flood risk; Scenario development","agricultural production; flood damage; food production; future prospect; national planning; numerical model; probability; socioeconomic conditions; socioeconomic survey; vulnerability; China; Taihu Basin",,,,,"(2007) The national population development strategy research report, , China National Family Planning Commission.

The spatial extent of the resulting agglomerations increases with the taste for variety and the expenditure share on manufactured goods, and decreases with transport costs.

Some critics allege that the housing bubble and ensuing financial crisis were consequences of misguided state intervention, while others contend that the sources of the crisis lay in the pathologies of unregulated markets. Both sides, however, treat the crisis and its underlying causes primarily through an economic lens of cost-benefit analysis. Building on the insights of contemporary political theorists and the new institutionalism in political science, we consider American housing policy from the vantage of virtue theory. Not only is housing and mortgage policy inevitably normative, but public policy can be an important tool in fostering what we call the subprime virtues of truth-telling, promise-keeping, frugality, moderation, commitment, foresight, and judgment that are absolute prerequisites for any decent society. © 2013 American Political Science Association.",,,,,,,"Ackerman, B., (1980) Social Justice and the Liberal State, , New Haven: Yale University Press; Akerlof, G.A., Shiller, R.J., (2009) Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; (2010) Sachs and the Shitty: A Ghastly Day on Capitol Hill for Goldman Sachs's Top Brass, the Economist, , Anonymous April 29; (1934) The Nicomachean Ethics, , Aristotle Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Arnold, K.M., McDermott, K.B., Szpunar, K.K., Imagining the near and far future: The role of location familiarity (2011) Memory and Cognition, 39, pp. 954-967; (1864) The Confessions of Augustine, , Augustine Boston: Gould & Lincoln; (1887) A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, , Augustine New York: The Christian Literature Company; Avramenko, R., (2011) Courage: The Politics of Life and Limb., , Notre Dame University of Notre Dame Press; Avsar, R., A critique of 'neoliberal autonomy' the rhetoric of ownership society (2008) Forum for Social Economics, 37 (2), pp. 125-134; Barber, B., (1984) Strong Democracy, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Berkowitz, P., (1999) Virtue and the Making of Modern Liberalism, , Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press; Vikas, B., Leonhardt, D., The reckoning: Tax break may have helped cause housing bubble (2008) The New York Times, , December 18; Bitner, R., (2008) Confessions of A Subprime Lender: An Insider's Tale of Greed, Fraud, and Ignorance, , Hobo-ken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons; Boyd, R., (2004) Uncivil Society: The Perils of Pluralism and the Making of Modern Liberalism, , Lanham, MD Lexington Books; Boyd, R., The value of civility?

When these threats become reality they are not only responsible for widespread illness, injury, and large-scale losses of life but also for the destruction of property and devastating economic losses. Over recent decades we have seen new technological advances, economic globalization, and ongoing international political unrest as components of risk to national and international security. Nowadays, trend analysis and technology foresight are predicting new technological breakthroughs in science and therefore new potential threats for human society. For countermeasures, local, national, and international authorities and organizations need to collaborate to be prepared and to establish the best available response strategy to minimize the potential loss of lives, to reduce economic loss, and to avoid new international conflicts.

Maui has more beaches than any island in Hawaii, attracting tourists and oceanfront investment. In the late 1960s, with the islands agrarian economy of sugar cane and pineapple exports faltering, the County's leadership began marketing its coastal resources as a destination economy, beaches chief among them (Chu, 1965). The Island built a destination development economy out of its beaches, unique coastal resources and access to ocean recreation (HTA, 2005). Good planning and foresight by the local municipal county government could have protected these natural assets, thereby sustaining the island's development. Instead, the county relied on a standardized building setback policy that failed to account for erosion prone areas.Four decades later, realizing the impending loss of the island's premier asset, namely beaches and access to the shoreline, the County moved to site-specific erosion-rate based setback policy. Government regulatory action, including setbacks for constructing buildings along the shoreline, form an integral part of the community's response to climate change and sea level rise (Codiga et al., 2011). The erosion-based setback policy, now a decade old, encountered numerous problems with its implementation. This led to delays in government permitting of oceanfront development and a number of time-consuming amendments to revise the policy. Here we present the unanticipated outcomes of the policy's implementation, particularly challenges to demark the shoreline setback area and delineate erosion prone areas. We also discuss the inherent problems encountered when applying the method to properties with ocean on more than one side or irregularly shaped parcels and situations where cliffs or bluffs rise from the sea.With proper foresight, a destination economy can sustain its growth for years to come by prudently planning for coastal hazards while retaining the natural assets that formed the basis of their destination economy. We conclude by offering lessons learned from experience implementing shoreline setbacks that that will help coastal planners, practitioners, regulators and policy makers save time and avoid mistakes and delays when considering oceanfront development policies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Coastal hazards; Coastal resources; Development policies; Integral part; Policy makers; Regulatory actions; Sea level rise; Site-specific; Beaches; Climate change; Economics; Erosion; International trade; Natural resources; Sea level; Sugar cane; Public policy; environmental policy; industrial investment; marine resource; policy making; precautionary principle; recreational activity; sea level change; shoreline change; tourism market; tourist destination; waterfront development; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Maui; United States; Ananas comosus; Saccharum",,,,,"Boruff, B.J., Emrich, C., Cutter, S.C., Erosion hazard vulnerability of US coastal counties (2005) Journal of Coastal Research, 21 (5), pp. 932-942; Callies, D.L., (2010) Regulating Paradise - Land Use Controls in Hawaii, , University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu; (2003) The Coastal Construction Control Line Program, , http://www.colliergov.net/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx%3fdocumentid%3d768, CC-EAR, Issue #4, Section 2.25 Hurricane Evaluation, Conservation and Coastal Management Element of the Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR), Collier County, Florida, 23 N; (2011) CGC Coastal Geology Group, Coastal Imagery and Data, Maui, , http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/coasts/publications/hawaiiCoastline/maui.html, University of Hawaii, School of Ocean & Earth Science & Technology, Department of Geology and Geophysics webpage last updated on August 14th, 2011; Chu, E., (1965) An Economic Study of the County of Maui.

The project organised conversations about sustainability ideas for some cities in Europe, including Venice, and for Europe as a whole. For the city of Venice four different scenarios were built, illustrated and debated through a social research process. The project is emblematic of many discussions about anticipation, foresight and "" futuring"" activities taking place today in many places. In this paper we discuss how conversations about the future are indeed enquiries in the present; we also use Borges Aleph invention and post-normal science to argue that "" futuring"" conversations need to pull in often neglected types of knowledge; we also argue that the ways in which plausibility of "" future"" scenarios is argued needs to be deliberated by all concerned and not relinquished to a specific elite. Eventually, we argue that a post-normal framework and its associated concept of fitness for purpose contains the necessary elements for making "" futuring"" activities a fundamental step on humans' desirable constant self-reflection. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"development project; future prospect; implementation process; sustainability; urban development; Italy; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice",,,,,"Irwin, A., Risk, Science and Science and Public Communication: third-order thinking about scientific culture (2008) Handbook of Public Communication of Science and Technology, pp. 199-212. , Routledge, London & New York, M.

While the relevance of dealing with trends is constantly underlined, the effects of labeling phenomena as trends and megatrends in an organizational context have not been widely discussed. In particular, the dangers of dealing with megatrend semantics are that the strategic implications of these phenomena are unclear and that an organization is likely to increase its blind spots, thereby actually undermining its foresight capability.This paper applies a discourse-theoretical perspective developed by Ernesto Laclau and Chantalle Mouffe to trend management in organizations. It argues that megatrends can be perceived as empty signifiers, as they provide an overdetermined, abstract form of meaning that addresses discourses but cannot convey concrete meaning for management. It is proposed that instead of concentrating on megatrends (empty signifiers), trend management should reconstruct those elements of a discourse in which shifts of meaning can be observed, detecting and understanding the nodal points of a discourse. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Discourse theory; Empty signifier; Megatrends; Nodal points; Trends","detection method; management; organizational framework; strategic approach; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic response in turbulent environments (1982) Working Paper no 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management; Rossel, P., Weak signals as a flexible framing space for enhanced management and decision-making (2009) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21, pp. 307-320; Martinet, A.-C., Strategic planning, strategic management, strategic foresight: the seminal work of H.

The paper offers a range of interpretations of the court proceedings, and through this questions the shifting role of leadership within and between the parties involved, the meaning of professionalism, what it is to behave professionally, and the impact of ethics on how leaders and professionals conduct themselves. Causal layered analysis (Inayatullah, 1998) is used to reframe leadership and Theory U (Scharmer, 2009) is used to establish a basis of professionalism. In extending these principles to other contexts, the author questions what a future society might look like and how we might like to behave professionally in the future. The paper concludes by offering a model of leadership that resonates with foresight in its driver of change in search of an alternative, 'better' future. In recognising this, the paper also raises the issue with normative future visions and actions of 'better for whom?' noting that better for some will be worse for others and that this realisation both needs to be considered and mitigated for in leadership of change.","Causal layered analysis; Ethics; Leadership; Professionalism; T-cycle",,,,,,"Abbott, A., (1988) The system of professions: An essay on the Division of Expert Labour, , Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; Bandura, A., Self-Efficacy Mechanism in Human Agency (1982) American Psychologist, 37 (2); (2008), http://www.bllaw.co.uk/pdf/EQU_0708_eqbulletin.pdf, Blake Lapthorn Tarlo Lyons' Equine Bulletin - July 2008.

In this article stéphane Cordobes, Philippe Estèbe and Martin Vanier underscore how helpful this programme might prove to be for the renewal of spatial planning policies in France through its new approach, which combines the local, national and even European scales and gives priority to an analysis of territorial spaces by major functions; its non-normative stance; and its highlighting of strategic issues and options for public policy. The authors then delve into four of the major issues that will have to be confronted in order to build up a medium-to-long-term ""spatial planning agenda"" in France: the empowerment of all territories to meet the major social, economic and environmental challenges facing them; the development of strategies in step with globalized economies and societies; ecological transition; and a sensitivity to the needs inherent in a mobile society. These are so many challenges that offer opportunities, but also bring contradictions, which the local and national authorities with responsibility for spatial planning will have to face up to.",,,,,,,"Aubert, F., Larmagnac, C., Marcelpoil, E., (2012) Les Villes Intermédiaires à l'Horizon 2040, (386), pp. 47-64. , juin; Barthe, L., Milian, J., (2012) Les Espaces de Faible Densité en France à l'Horizon 2040, (389), pp. 39-54. , octobre; Cattan, N., (2012) France: Portes d'Entrée et Flux.

The Basin lies in the coastal delta of the Yangtze River and is defended from frequent flooding by a complex system of flood control infrastructure (including dikes, numerous large sluice gates and pumping stations). Flood risk in the Basin is closely related to the reliability of the flood defences. The information available to support system reliability analysis is however limited. A simplified defence classification and reliability analysis has therefore been adopted in which the behaviour of defence subsystems (dike rings) are presented through a single representative fragility curve. A combination of expert judgement and available quantified data is used to support the analysis. The approach is found to be informative within the context of (i) a broad scale flood risk analysis, (ii) an exploration of longer term management policies and (iii) targeting more detailed analysis and data collection required to support specific management choices. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM).","Flood control infrastructure; Foresight; Fragility; Reliability analysis; Risk analysis; System reliability; Taihu","data acquisition; decision making; delta; flood control; flooding; infrastructural development; management practice; reliability analysis; risk assessment; China; Taihu Basin",,,,,"Buijs, F., Simm, J., Wallis, M., Sayers, P., (2007) Performance and reliability of flood and coastal defences, , London: Environment Agency; Casciati, A., Faravelli, A., (1991) Fragility analysis of complex structural systems, , Taunton: Research Studies Press; (1990) Probabilistic design of flood defences, , CUR/TAW.

Three main categories of environmental shock are identified; extreme events, abrupt swings, and tipping points. The factors determining the predictability of different shocks and hence the prospects for early warning are outlined. Lessons from existing early warning systems for extreme events and abrupt climate swings are summarised. Then the potential for early warning of bifurcation-type tipping points is explained, and contrasted with the lack of warning when stochastic internal variability triggers a shift in the state of a system. The scientific and technological progress needed to improve early warning capability is outlined. Then the framework is applied to the Foresight project on Migration and Global Environmental Change, with its focal eco-regions of drylands, low-elevation coastal zones, and mountainous regions. Priority targets for early warning systems are identified and the need for an integrated approach to early warning is highlighted, which considers the interactions between different types of environmental shock. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd","Bifurcation; Climate change; Early warning system; Ecosystem services; Environmental shock; Extreme event; Tipping point","Article; climate change; coastal waters; ecosystem; environmental change; environmental parameters; environmental shock; environmental temperature; food security; forecasting; greenhouse effect; heat stress; human; Markov chain; noise; priority journal; sea surface temperature",,,,,"Ashok, K., Tam, C.Y., Lee, W.J., ENSO Modoki impact on the Southern Hemisphere storm track activity during extended austral winter (2009) Geophysical Research Letters, 36, p.

In 1987 UN Commission on Environment and Development attempted to propose how to enable people and whole nations to develop while sustaining functioning ecosystems and healthy environment. The key term became ""sustainable development"". But problem with sustainable development concept is that it is so vague and ""all-embracing"". Its biggest deficiency is the fact that it fails to attempt to even define human needs. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20 conference, June 2012) did not change current unsustainable development trends. Therefore we should allow for and ponder the possibility that effort at sustainable development will fail and the human community will experience great civilization turbulence. Maybe it is too late for sustainable development, what we need is a sustainable retreat. Our abilities are limited and promoting sustainable development may prove to be beyond us. In comparison with our ancestors we have much greater opportunities. But this has not been counterbalanced by greater responsibility and foresight. We should explore and study future opportunities and dangers that could occur under certain conditions. These images of possible futures may help to make our present decisions more qualified and responsible.","Rio Summit; Rio+20 Summit; sustainable development; sustainable retreat; World Summit; zero growth","education; environmental economics; environmental protection; health care; life expectancy; quality of life; sustainable development; United Nations; United Nations Conference on Environment and Development",,,,,"Barney, G.O., (1980) The Global 2000 Report to the President, , Pergamon Press, Oxford; Botkin, J., Elmandjra, M., Malitza, M., (1978) No Limits to Learning, , Pergamon Press, Oxford; Brown, L., (2009) Plan B 4.0-Mobilizing to Save Civilization, , W.W.

A major campaign to eradicate nonnative goats and burros was initiated in 1995 on Alcedo Volcano in the Galápagos Archipelago that ultimately removed 62,868 goats and eliminated them by 2006. Planners of the eradication program had the foresight to invest in intensive monitoring of the status of the volcano's giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) population whose welfare was a primary motivation for the eradication effort. Monitoring revealed an increase in the proportion of juveniles among all tortoises as well as increased growth rates of individual tortoises on Alcedo Volcano from earlier to later phases of the eradication campaign. Over the same time frame in a control population on nearby Santa Cruz Island (where goats and donkeys were not removed) juvenile fraction and individual growth rates remained unchanged. Although goat removal coincided with occurrence of a rare climatic event that simultaneously boosted forage availability for tortoises, failure to observe a comparable improvement in the control population implies that removal of goats and burros was the primary causative factor of improving population status of tortoises on Alcedo Volcano. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration.","Eradication; Galápagos Islands; Giant tortoise; Goats; Invasive species; Population restoration","goat; growth rate; invasive species; juvenile; population dynamics; population size; restoration ecology; species conservation; turtle; Alcedo Volcano; Ecuador; Galapagos Islands; Isabela [Galapagos Islands]; Santa Cruz Islands; Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]; Solomon Islands [Solomon Islands (ISG)]; Alcedo; Capra hircus; Equus asinus; Geochelone nigra; Mammalia; Testudinidae",,,,,"Blake, S., Wikelski, M., Cabrera, F., Guezou, A., Silva, M., Sadeghayobi, E., Yackulic, C., Jaramillo, P., Seed dispersal by giant Galapagos tortoises Journal of Biogeography, , (in press); Caccone, A., Gentile, G., Gibbs, J.P., Fritts, T.H., Snell, H.L., Betts, J., Powell, J.R., Phylogeography and history of giant galapagos tortoises (2002) Evolution, 56, pp. 2052-2066; Carrion, V., Donlan, C.J., Campbell, K.J., Lavoie, C., Cruz, F., Archipelago-wide island restoration in the Galápagos Islands: Reducing costs of invasive mammal eradication programs and reinvasion risk (2011) PLoS One, 6, pp. e18835; Cayot, L.J., (1985) Effects of El Niño on giant tortoises and their environment.

Nurses from high-income countries (HICs) can leverage their wealth of resources to collaborate with nursing colleagues in LICs to expand clinical, education and research capacity. In turn, nurses from HICs gain stronger competency in the care they provide, improved communication skills and an increased understanding of global health issues. Aim: The purpose of this literature review is to identify international nursing clinical, education and research partnerships among nurses from LICs and HICs and to analyse the degree of collaboration involved in each partnership using DeSantis' counterpart concept. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of international nursing partnerships in the scientific literature from January 2001 to July 2012. A total of nine articles met inclusion criteria for analysis. Findings: All of the articles discuss lessons learnt in building international nursing partnerships among nurses from HICs and LICs. However, the articles failed to meet the criteria set forth by DeSantis' counterpart concept to achieve fully collaborative nursing partnerships. Conclusions: International nursing partnerships require more foresight and planning to create partnerships in which the benefits derived by nurses from LICs equal those of their colleagues from HICs. By striving for such collaboration, international nursing partnerships can help build nursing clinical, education and research capacity in LICs. © 2013 The Authors.

In the US, FTA has been used to create visionary concepts and to promote cooperation between and among agencies, departments of the federal government, academia, and stakeholders. In Germany FTA has mainly been used to shape and define research and innovation agendas of established science-industry networks. The aim of the paper is to show what problems/challenges with regard to the innovation system have been addressed and what main actors have been involved, from the first monitoring and forecasting studies on nanotechnology to the establishment of national nanotechnology programs and continuing on until today. The paper offers a comparative analysis of the use and role of FTA where the focus is not on individual activities, but rather on the longer-term interplay between the organizational settings in both countries and the future-oriented nanotechnology analysis. In countries such as the US and Germany, where FTA on nanotechnology were already underway in the late 1980s, the early stages of FTA relied on expert-based methods such as technology intelligence and technology forecasting to define the field and to explore what could happen in general. Participatory formats such as dialogues on ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA) became more important only later on. Especially the inter-organizational setting can be considered a crucial condition for maximizing the impact that participatory FTA can have in the future governance of nanotechnology. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Emerging technologies; Foresight; Governance; Key enabling technologies; Nanotechnology; Public engagement; Responsible research and innovation; Technology assessment","Emerging technologies; Enabling technologies; Foresight; Governance; Public engagement; Technology assessments; Economic and social effects; Nanotechnology; Social aspects; Technological forecasting; Technology; Innovation; comparative study; governance approach; innovation; nanotechnology; research; technological development; Germany; United States",,,,,"Nanotechnology research directions: IWGN workshop report (1999) Vision for Nanotechnology Research and Development in the Next Decade, , NSTC, National Science and Technology Council; (2002) Strategische Neuausrichtung.

As such, there is increasing interest in the neurobiological mechanisms of impulsivity, as well as the genetic and environmental influences that govern the expression of this behaviour. Tests used on rodent models of impulsivity share strong parallels with tasks used to assess this trait in humans, and studies in both suggest a crucial role of monoaminergic corticostriatal systems in the expression of this behavioural trait. Furthermore, rodent models have enabled investigation of the causal relationship between drug abuse and impulsivity. Here, we review the use of rodent models of impulsivity for investigating the mechanisms involved in this trait, and how these mechanisms could contribute to the pathogenesis of addiction. © 2013.

He begins by reminding us which are the numerically dominant religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism etc.), how they are distributed geographically and how that distribution has changed over a period of almost a century. He stresses, in passing, the difficulties inherent in statistical assessments of this kind, in which the data may be incomplete or biased, or mask more subtle developments. Mabille goes on to analyse four major trends that have manifested themselves in the worldwide spread of religious influence: the return of religion to the political agenda, the broadening of the spectrum of religious movements, the increasing political role of religious diasporas, and the vitality of both Islam and Christianity. These are four developments which complicate the potential process of secularization. Lastly, Mabille turns a spotlight on the futures of Catholicism (""from crisis to decline?""), of Islam (""secularism, fundamentalism or liberalism?"") and of Buddhism with a Western slant. family model, greater liberalism on moral issues, greater politicization etc.), as do those who have no religious affiliations. Muslims and Orthodox Christians have a more traditional system of values (family, morals, authority, national pride etc.), while Catholics occupy an intermediate position. Pierre Bréchon goes on to study the specific impact of the religious variables in value-systems by way of a ""ceteris paribus"" statistical analysis, cross-comparing other variables (sex, age, income etc.). He concludes that it is religious geography which introduces the most notable differences into value-systems, not the individual dimensions of religiosity (such as declared affiliations) and that, while denominational allegiance is not to any great extent a discriminating factor, degree of religiosity does, on the other hand, have distinctly more of an influence on values (in the direction of greater traditionalism)-and this is the case whatever the denomination concerned.",,,,,,,"(2012) The Global Religious Landscape: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Major Religious Groups as of 2010, , Washington, D.

Added to these now are the consequences of an ageing population (on employment and public health, and with regard to dependency etc.) and the limitations imposed by the state's indebtedness. Governments of right and left have come and gone without really providing any miracle solution. The time has perhaps come, then, to undertake a large-scale revision of the French social system and of the terms of the contract whereby citizens connect with one another and the state. When we take a genuine foresight approach to the examination of this question, one of the key elements is the way both public and private-sector inter-generational transfers are organized. These provide evidence, implicitly or explicitly, of the general orientation of the ""social contract"". This is why Futuribles is opening its columns this month to an extensive exercise in thinking about these inter-generational transfers in the form of two articles which present the underlying ideological issues and relevant perspectives. The first of these analyses the modalities by which sustainable public transfers could be made in France, while the second looks at private transfers and possible action to reduce the importance of inherited wealth in French society. In this first article, then, André Masson examines public transfers between generations. He reviews the ""ideological triangle"" of sociogenerational discourses (the ""free agent"" paradigm, that of ""citizen equality"" and the ""multi-solidarity"" model) and the underlying dilemmas for the state. He then goes on to analyse the forms of transfer that would ultimately ensure the solvency of the Welfare state for each of the three paradigms identified: (1) the withdrawal of the state and the promotion of saving and life-annuities if priority is given to the ""free agent""; (2) reorientation of the state in favour of youth in the ""citizen equality"" model; (3) safeguarding the protection of the elderly through a renewed social pact in the ""multi-solidarity"" vision. However, André Masson also stresses how difficult it will be to undertake any reform in a country as torn as is France between these three prospective paths. Lastly, in an additional section, he goes into greater detail on the subject of possible courses of reform to the pensions system within a multisolidarity framework (which is sometimes seen as the dominant paradigm in France).",,,,,,,"Piketty, T., On the long-run evolution of inheritance: France 1820-2050 (2011) Quarterly Journal of Economies, 126 (3), pp. 1071-1131; Arrondel, L., Masson, A., Transferts Publics et Privés Entre Générations.

When these are lacking, overconfidence and error can occur. Aims: Multiple choice questions (MCQ) responses were used to estimate insight, as determined by confidence in responses, and foresight, as determined by the safety of incorrect responses. Methods: An MCQ response system was developed which reflected confidence in, and safeness of, responses. An optional examination incorporating this system was offered to medical students at one university. Results: A total of 372 students completed the study. There was evidence of insight. The proportion of responses that were correct rose from 32% for low confidence to 77% for high confidence. The proportion that was incorrect and not unsafe fell from 34% for low confidence to 7% for high confidence. There was less evidence of foresight. Of the responses that were incorrect, the proportion that was unsafe increased from 52% for low confidence to 68% for high confidence. Measures of insight and foresight increased with experience. Students with poorer knowledge chose more unsafe responses, but with lower confidence. Five students gave multiple highly unsafe responses held with high confidence. Conclusions: Students had insight but less foresight. Experience and knowledge altered measures of both. This response system identified students who appeared to lack both. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.",,"article; clinical competence; decision making; education; human; psychological aspect; study skills; Choice Behavior; Clinical Competence; Decision Making; Educational Measurement; Humans; Test Taking Skills",,,,,"Ahlgren, A., (1969) Reliability, predictive validity, and personality bias of confidence-weighted scores, , In: Crockenberg V, editor.

It seeks to address the combination of outputs in an objective manner to identify expected areas of future innovation toward the desired future as well as related areas that are supposed to play a key part. Three investigative studies using the Delphi method, scenario and workshop were conducted independently in consideration of four global or national challenges. The points of the studies are interdisciplinary or diversified discussion and a mission-oriented approach. Information from the Delphi method and scenario is converged using text mining to position scientific and technological areas in a big picture. Combining outputs reveals the whole picture of scientific and technological areas, including specific areas and common factors to be promoted toward the desired society. The result shows that green-related and life-related areas are two major areas where future innovation is expected. ICT, management and globalization are common factors that would be critical to promote innovations in these areas. This paper is a case study of combining outputs at the last stage of a national foresight exercise to identify areas where future innovation is expected. It suggests the potential of combining outputs by capitalizing on the full value of the information obtained. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Combination; Delphi method; Foresight; Forward planning; Innovation; Scenario; Sustainable development",,,,,,"Cachia, R., Compano, R., Da Costa, O., Grasping the potential of online social networks for foresight (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74 (8), pp. 1179-1203; Cuhls, K., Bode, O., Ganz, W., Wanke, P., (2008) The BMBF Foresight Process, , paper presented at the 3rd International Seville Seminar on Future-oriented Technology Analysis, October 16-17, Seville; (2004) Converging Technologies – Shaping the Future of European Societies, , European Commission, Brussels; (2009) Mapping Foresight: Revealing how Europe and Other World Regions Navigate into the Future, , European Commission, Brussels; (2010) Europe 2020: A Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, , European Commission, Brussels; (2009) A Strategy for American Innovation: Driving Towards Sustainable Growth and Quality Jobs, , Executive Office of the President, National Economic Council, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Washington, DC; Gordon, T., Pease, A.R.T., Delphi: an efficient, ‘round-less', almost real time Delphi method (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73, pp. 321-333; (2001) The 2nd Science and Technology Basic Plan, , Government of Japan, Tokyo; (2006) The 3rd Science and Technology Basic Plan, , Government of Japan, Tokyo; (2011) The 4th Science and Technology Basic Plan, , Government of Japan, Tokyo; Kanama, D., Kondo, A., Yokoo, Y., Development of technology foresight: integration of technology roadmapping and the Delphi method (2008) International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning, 4 (2), pp. 184-200; Loveridge, D., (1999) Foresight and Delphi processes as information sources for scenario planning, , Ideas in Progress Paper No. 11, Policy Research in Engineering, Science & Technology, University of Manchester, Manchester; Mietzner, D., Reger, G., Advantages and disadvantages of scenario approaches for strategic foresight (2005) International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning, 1 (2), pp. 220-239; (2011) Strategy for American Innovation: Securing our Economic Growth and Prosperity, , National Economic Council, Council of Economic Advisors, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Washington, DC; (2009) Emerging fields in science and technology for the 4th Science and Technology Basic Plan, , Research Material No. 168, National Institute of Science and Technology Policy, Tokyo; (2010) The 9th Science and Technology Foresight, , NISTEP Report No. 140-142, National Institute of Science and Technology Policy, Tokyo; (2002) Converging technologies for improving human performance, , National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA; (2005) Managing nano-bio-info-cogno innovations: converging technology society, , National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA; Popper, R., How are foresight methods selected?

The proposed framework is validated with 365 respondents from Nantou County, which is located in Taiwan. The findings show that patient trust (social trust and institutional trust) has significantly positive effects on the perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness separately, which in turn influence usage intention. This study also confirms that both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are important mediators between patient trust and usage intention. According to the statistical results, the proposed model fits very well for the samples. This study emphasizes that hospital managers should pay more attention to building a trusting relationship between the elderly and caregivers, and improving the quality of the system. The integrative viewpoint implies that a successful telecare system is not only an information system but also a service provider/department to the patients. The findings may be used as a theoretical basis for future research and can also offer empirical foresight to the executives and managers of hospitals when they initially introduce and promote the telecare systems into their surrounding community. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Institutional trust;

Research policy makers need specific information and insight on how the structured view of the future provided by foresight affects their strategic planning. Therefore, deriving the maximum benefit from foresight activities requires a carefully designed and actively driven transfer process of foresight results into research policy making. This paper aims to present such a process (""strategic dialogue"") and illustrate it with recent examples from Germany. Design/methodology/approach: The authors compare strategic dialogues with existing dialogue instruments and investigate the relevance of their theoretical foundations to transferring foresight results into research policy making. They capture the lessons learnt from such dialogues in a seven-step process that can be adapted to specific situations. Specific success factors are identified and linked to the process. Findings: Strategic dialogues have proved to be an effective and efficient instrument for achieving the transfer of results from strategic processes such as foresight into research policy making. They ensure that foresight results are processed into a form that is directly useful as an input for policy development. They also help to create a joint vision for the future and to shape supporting infrastructure measures. Originality/value: The transfer of foresight results into research policy making has not featured prominently so far in discussions of foresight efforts and methods. However, it is a crucial element in ensuring that such activities have maximum impact. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Foresight; Germany; Governance; Innovation; Management; Research policy; Scenario planning; Stakeholder alignment; Strategic dialogue; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Bohm, D., (1996) On Dialogue, , Routledge, New York, NY; Cagnin, C., Loveridge, D., (2011) A business framework for building anticipatory capacity to manage disruptive and transformative change and lead business networks towards sustainable development, , paper presented at the Fourth International Seville Conference on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis, May 12-13, Seville; Fisher, R., Ury, W., (1991) Getting to Yes - Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In, , Penguin, New York, NY; (2010) BMBF Foresight, , www.bmbf-foresight.de, available at, (accessed May 1, 2011), German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; (2010) Zukunftsbild Morgenstadt, , www.bmbf.de/pubRD/morgenstadt.pdf, available at, (accessed May 1, 2011), German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Meister, H., Oldenburg, F., Foresight und Innovation: Zukunfts denken - Heute gestalten (2008) Beteiligung - Ein Programm für Wirtschaft, Politik Und Gesellschaft, pp. 119-138. , Physica Verlag, Heidelberg; Susskind, L., Movius, H., (2009) Built to Win: Creating A World-Class Negotiating Organization, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Warnke, P., Cuhls, K., (2011) Embedding systemic priorities into the STI landscape.

The paper analyses the implementation of the Irish foresight exercise and the main outputs generated. It connects the results of the project with the literature on foresight, innovation and grand challenges. Findings: The emergence of grand challenges within research and innovation policy discourse in Europe has refreshed key questions for foresight theory and practice. Although many grand challenges have relatively clear implications for research and innovation (investment), others do not. A bottom-up, participatory process produced a broader set of grand challenges. Research limitations/implications: The concept of grand challenges is still relatively new. Practical implications: Not all research and innovation priorities are linked to grand challenges. National policies need to take account of grand challenges whilst continuing to support other research and innovation needs. Originality/value: The paper introduces a novel approach for identifying grand challenges and responses within the research and innovation system through a bottom-up process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Foresight; Forward planning; Grand challenges; Innovation; Ireland; Research and innovation policy; Research prioritization",,,,,,"(2008) Challenging Europe's Research: Rationales for the European Research Area (ERA), , Report of the ERA Expert Group, European Commission, Brussels, European Commission DG Research; (2009) Preparing Europe for a New Renaissance.

The objective of this paper is to develop an integrative method for systematically clustering, analyzing and visualizing the path for technology development and transformation. Design/methodology/approach: Delphi topics related to sustainable energy were collected from strategic foresight reports of Japan, South Korea and China, and used as sources for future technology themes analysis. A standard mapping taxonomy based on international patent classification system was used to map out the technology concept described in these future technology themes. Technology interactions can be identified through a causal effect analysis during the mapping, and the results among selected countries are cross-compared and visualized in an aggregated view. Findings: By this standard mapping taxonomy and structured analysis, future technology themes in strategic foresight reports from countries in focus are systematically mapped and integrated for viewing future technology options and interactions. Similarities and discrepancies for prospecting the future technology trajectory among these countries are also identified. Research limitations/implications: It would be a significant contribution if this structured analysis could be applied more broadly across different geographic regions or across research areas in foresight reports. This research may help to solve the practical difficulties faced during the secondary analysis of foresight studies in foresight preparatory studies by providing a consistent classification framework to make comparison and aggregation of future technology options from different countries/regions. Also, this classification framework can provide a bridge for linking with current technology performance such as patent productivity or quality and help in identifying the gaps between the probable future changes in S&T and the current capability. Originality/value: The integrative method in this research provides a way to combine both the advantage of strategic technology foresight and competitive technology intelligence by utilizing the results deriving from the former as targets for analysis and the analytic practice deriving from the latter to identify the possible competitive or cooperative landscapes in the future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive technology intelligence; Delphi topic analysis; Forward planning; Innovation; International patent classification system; Strategic technology foresight; Sustainable energy",,,,,,"Aichholzer, G., (2001) Delphi Austria: An example of tailoring foresight to the needs of a small country, , www.oeaw.ac.at/ita/pdf/ita_01_02.pdf, available at, (accessed March 8, 2010); Ashton, B.W., Klavans, R.A., (1997) Keeping Abreast of Science and Technology: Technical Intelligence for Business, , Batelle Press, Columbus, OH; Ashton, B.W., Johnson, A.H., Stacey, G.S., Monitoring science and technology for competitive advantage (1994) Competitive Intelligence Review, 5 (1), pp. 5-16; Barney, J.B., Strategic factor market: Expectations, luck, and business strategy (1986) Management Science, 32 (10), pp. 1231-1241; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Calof, J., Smith, J., The integrative domain of foresight and competitive intelligence and its impact on R&D management (2010) R&D Management, 40 (1), pp. 31-39; Curran, C.S., Leker, J., Patent indicators for monitoring convergence - examples from NFF and ICT (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78, pp. 256-273; Fujii, A., Foresight on information society technologies in Europe (2006) Science & Technology Trends Quarterly Review, , www.nistep.go.jp/achiev/ftx/eng/stfc/stt018e/qr18pdf/STTqr1802.pdf, No. 18, available at, (accessed March 8, 2011); Gavigan, J.P., Cahill, E., (1997) Overview of recent European and non-European national technology foresight studies, , Technical Report No. TR97/02, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Seville; Grant, R., The resource-based theory of competitive advantage: Implications for strategy formulation (1991) California Management Review, 33 (3), pp. 114-135; Griliches, Z., Patent statistics as economic indicators: A survey (1990) Journal of Economic Literature, 28 (4), pp. 1661-1707; Grupp, H., Linstone, H.A., National technology foresight activities around the globe: Resurrection and new paradigms (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 60 (1), pp. 85-94; Hax, A., Majluf, N., (1996) The Strategy Concept and Process: A Pragmatic Approach, , Prentice Hall, London; Herring, J.P., Scientific and technical intelligence: The key to R&D (1993) Journal of Business Strategy, 15, pp. 10-12; Kayal, A., Measuring the pace of technological progress: Implications for technological forecasting (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 60 (3), pp. 237-245; Markides, C., Williamson, P., Related diversificaton, core competences and corporate performance (1994) Strategic Management Journal, 15, pp. 149-157; Martin, B.R., Foresight in science and technology (1995) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 7 (2), pp. 139-168; Martino, J.P., (1983) Technological Forecasting for Decision Making, , North Holland, Amsterdam, 2nd ed; Nelson, R., (1997) Why Do Firms Differ and How Does It Matter?

They are The Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States and The United States Commission into 21st Century Terrorism and National Security Report. Stemming from our analysis of how these commissions make sense of the risk posed by terrorism to national security, we seek to make three contributions. First, we develop sensemaking/sensegiving concepts in public commission reporting by theorizing about hindsight-foresight temporal dynamics. In particular, we extend existing sensemaking scholarship on public commission reporting by directing attention towards the important, yet under-scrutinized role that these inquiries have in sensemaking about the future. Second, we extend the presuppositions underpinning sensemaking theory by operationalizing concepts of antenarrative and employing them in our comparative analysis of the two reports. Third, we contribute to practice by illustrating empirically some of the 'tactics' that can be used for challenging hindsight about the known past for the purpose of improving foresight about an unknown future. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Hindsight; Public commission; Sensegiving; Sensemaking; Terrorism","Foresight; Hindsight; Public commission; Sensegiving; Sensemaking; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Terrorism; national security; temporal analysis; terrorism; United States",,,,,"Taleb, N., (2008) The Black Swan: the Impact of the Highly Improbable, , Penguin, New York; Turner, B., Organizational and interorganizational development of disasters (1976) Adm.

Design/methodology/approach: The three foresight studies used different methodologies depending on the project's goal. First the projects' interconnections are explained. Second, each of the studies is characterised from different viewpoints, including their aims, structures, methodologies and results. Finally their influence on policy-making is evaluated. Findings: The paper concludes that implementation of these three interrelated studies allows identification of S&T&I priorities that have a strong connection with policy decision making. Therefore, on the basis of this experience, it is suggested that a widespread national Delphi survey for the identification of science and technology (S&T) priorities should be complemented by the identification of key long-term demand for resources and reshaped management systems.

As a result of his analysis, the author categorized patents into four groups according to benefits and risk factors extracted from a factor analysis, and for each group of patents the author offers possible strategies for further commercialization. The method, which uses fuzzy measurement to pinpoint the location of a patent in a matrix with great precision, is more accurate than traditional technology portfolio planning models that rely on Likert scales. The method can highlight change in the meaning and strategic grouping of a patent.

Arguably, there has been a general failure to examine and explicate the relationship between theory and method. As Poli; Karlsen & Karlsen; Aaltonen; Inayatullah and others argue, there is both a need and a will to develop a substantial foundation of futures studies that not only goes beyond epistemology, but explicitly tries to establish an ontological rationale for futures research as a post-positivist scientific activity. Following along this line, the purpose of this paper is to represent a radical constructivist approach to the theory of latents and level of realities that transcends traditional phenomenology. Design/methodology/approach: The paper also gives a brief outline on how Kant meets Latour and constitutes and reproduces two ontological areas, man and nature and argues in favour of a post-post conception called ""universal perspectivism"". Findings: It is found that the foresight community and futurists must revert to some basic ontological assumptions about the future, e.g. as a reflection of human imagination or as a projection of today's situation, particularly the reproduction of the construction of an idea of the human being as such, and its opposite - what it is not. Originality/value: The consequences for anticipation activities are tremendous: in forward looking activities we reproduce both the distinction between reality in itself and reality for us, or put differently, between appearances and latent. These are then linked to the differentiation between two basic ontological areas throughout all time modalities, nature and society (man). The link between pasts, presents and futures is getting closer. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Causal layered analyses; Epistemology; Foresight; Futures research; Level of reality; Ontology; Philosophy; Reality; Research work; Scenarios; Sociology of knowledge",,,,,,"Claussen, T., Common abilities for knowledge of nature and society (2006) Norwegian Journal of Philosophy, 3. , (in Norwegian language); de Jouevenel, B., (1967) The Art of Conjecture, , Weidenfeld and Nicholson, London; Inayatullah, S., (2004) The Causal Layered Analyses (CLA) Reader, , Tampang University, Tamsui, Taiwan; Inayatullah, S., Six pillars: Futures thinking for transforming (2008) Foresight, 10 (1), pp. 4-21; Kant, I., (1787) Kritik Der Reinen Vernunft (B-Edition), , Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt; Karlsen, J.E., Øverland, E.F., (2010) CARPE FUTURUM.

Life of the typical agent is divided between youth (firth period) and old age (second period). The latter period of life is, in turn, divided between work time and retirement time in a proportion contingent on an individual's state of health. We show that: (i) a unique non-trivial steady state exists, and (ii) when the labour income tax rates used to finance health expenditure or public pensions are included in an intermediate range of values, complex dynamics occur when individuals have perfect foresight. This holds because the increase either in the fraction of time spent working when old or disability pensions reduces savings and capital accumulation. In addition, dynamic phenomena such as multiple bubbling structures related to the bifurcation diagram can be observed. Under some general assumptions, we show that the rise in health care expenditure and/or public pensions initially destabilises the steady-state equilibrium and causes complex dynamics but eventually acts as a stabilising device. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Health; Old-age labour; OLG model; PAYG pensions; Perfect foresight","Bifurcation diagram; Capital accumulation; Complex dynamics; Disability pension; Dynamic phenomena; General equilibrium; Health expenditures; Income tax; Non-trivial; Old age; Old-age labour; Pay-as-you-go; PAYG pensions; Perfect foresight; State of health; Steady state; Time spent; Work time; Economics; Health; Health care; Taxation; Dynamics",,,,,"Chakraborty, S., Endogenous lifetime and economic growth (2004) Journal of Economic Theory, 116 (1), pp. 119-137. , DOI 10.1016/j.jet.2003.07.005; Fogel, R.W., (2004) The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, , Cambridge University Press New York, NY; Evans, B.T., Pritchard, C., Cancer survival rates and GDP expenditure on health: A comparison of England and Wales and the USA, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland in the 1990s (2000) Public Health, 114, pp. 336-339; Cairncross, F., Economics: Age, health and wealth (2007) Nature, 448 (7156), pp. 875-876. , DOI 10.1038/448875a, PII 448875A; Fioroni, T., Child mortality and fertility: Public vs. private education (2010) Journal of Population Economics, 23, pp. 73-97; Becker, G.S., Philipson, T.J., Soares, R.R., The quantity and quality of life and the evolution of world inequality (2005) American Economic Review, 95 (1), pp. 277-291. , DOI 10.1257/0002828053828563; Cutler, D.M., Deaton, A.S., Lleras-Muney, A., The determinants of mortality (2006) The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 20, pp. 97-120; Young, A., The gift of the dying: The tragedy of AIDS and the welfare of future African generations (2005) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 120, pp. 243-266; Cervellati, M., Sunde, U., Human capital formation, life expectancy, and the process of development (2005) American Economic Review, 95 (5), pp. 1653-1672. , http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/aea/00028282/v95n5/ s16.pdf?expires=1144752069&id=28163691&titleid=6115&accname= Elsevier&checksum=5E548AA200372150983D2EDF568E05EB, DOI 10.1257/000282805775014380; Lorentzen, P., McMillan, J., Wacziarg, R., Death and development (2008) Journal of Economic Growth, 13, pp. 81-124; Galor, O., From stagnation to growth: Unified growth theory (2005) Handbook of Economic Growth, , P.

Sinagatullin demonstrates his remarkable gift in revealing questions too often ignored, unnoticed or wrongly interpreted by educators, teacher educators, education policy makers, and parents. Simultaneously he proposes fresh and insightful recommendations and strategies about how to find optimal solutions to these unnoticed problems that impede the successful functioning of education. His practical suggestions in solving such dilemmas are full of professional ingenuity and foresight. He supports his theoretical implications by pertinent examples drawn from his personal experience and observations. This book is a good source for secondary school teachers, teacher educators, pre-service teachers as well as parents. Education policy makers and school district officials may equally benefit from getting acquainted with it. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This method of selling securities had previously been banned by federal securities law but the new CROWDFUND Act overturns that prohibition. This Article introduces the CROWDFUND Act and explains that it can be expected to have two primary effects on securities law and capital markets. First, it will liberate startup companies to use peer networks and the Internet to obtain modest amounts of capital at low cost. Second, it will help democratize the market for financing speculative startup companies and allow investors of modest means to make investments that had previously been offered solely to wealthy, so-called ""accredited"" investors. This Article also offers two predictions as to how securities crowdfunding will play out in practice. First, it predicts that companies that sell equity via crowdfunding may find themselves the subject of hostile takeovers (though the founders of such companies can easily avoid that outcome if they act with a little foresight). Second, it predicts that issuers may prefer to crowdfund debt securities, such as bonds, rather than equity. The Article concludes with a few thoughts on the SEC's implementation of the Act in light of the potential for fraud. © 2013 The University of Notre Dame.",,,,,,,"Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, , Pub.

This paper focuses on the challenges facing the food industry and the role of food reformulation in meeting these challenges, through the lens of a public health nutritionist. Attention has been heightened by the Government's Responsibility Deal, launched in early 2011 by the Department of Health (England), by the UK's engagement with the global food security and food supply sustainability agendas and by the Government Office of Science's Foresight report. The Responsibility Deal's food network has to date focused on reduction of trans fatty acids, salt and calories and out-of-home calorie labelling (in food service settings). New pledges are expected soon on increasing fruit and vegetable intakes. Reformulation is a major feature of the Responsibility Deal's approach, and along with other approaches such as portion control, choice editing and information provision, there is potential to increase the breadth of healthier choices available to the public. With the exception of fruit and vegetables, the emphasis has been almost exclusively on aspects of the diet that are in excess for many of the population (e.g. energy and salt). Evidence of low consumption of some key micronutrients by some groups of the population, particularly adolescents and young adults, often alongside excess energy intake compared with expenditure, is all too often overlooked. This paper summarises the progress made to date, the challenges faced and the opportunities that exist, with particular focus on reformulation. One of the biggest challenges is the relatively poor understanding of how to effect positive and long-term dietary behaviour change. The paper concludes that, in isolation, reformulation is unlikely to provide a complete solution to the challenge of improving eating patterns and nutrient provision, although it is a contributor.

As a result, different scenarios and roadmap have been provided, often with contrasting outcomes. This paper is a short review of the existing literature aiming to summarize the main results obtained so far, describing the diverse ranges of possible development of these alternative vehicles over the next 40 years.

This book examines developments in foresight methodologies and relates in its greater part to the work done in the context of the COSTA22 network of the EU on Foresight Methodologies. Foresight is a professional practice that supports significant decisions, and as such it needs to be more assured of its claims to knowledge (methodology). Foresight is practiced across many domains and is not the preserve of specialized 'futurists', or indeed of foresight specialists. However, the disciplines of foresight are not well articulated or disseminated across domains, leading to re-inventions and practice that does not make best use of experience in other domains. The methodological development of foresight is an important task that aims at strengthening the pool of the tools available for application, thereby empowering the actors involved in foresight practice. Elaborating further on methodological issues, such as those presented in the present book, enables the actors involved in foresight to begin to critique current practice from this perspective and, thirdly, to begin to design foresight practice. The present trends towards methodological concerns indicates a move from 'given' expert-predicted futures to one in which futures are nurtured through a dialogue among ""stakeholders."" The book has four parts, each elaborating on a set of aspects of foresight methodologies. After an introductory section, Part II considers theorizing about foresight methodologies. Part III covers system content issues, and Part IV presents foresight tools and approaches. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

But little is known about the actual implementation of the results of Foresight studies, even though these aim to improve innovation capacities and national innovation systems. The design and initiation phase of Foresight studies include the setting of objectives and the identification of themes for the exercise. These activities need to be aligned to the broader perspective and mission of the initiator and, importantly, to the tendering procedure for launching Foresight activities. At national (and international) level it would be valuable to establish networks and a central database collecting the experiences of these studies, to make them accessible and useful for future Foresight studies. The main focus of such efforts should be on the procedural dimension learning from the Foresight processes and their organization. Currently Foresight studies are mainly used for detecting future social challenges, potential technological developments, and associated gaps and requirements for immediate, mid-term and long-term measures. Foresight studies also have the potential, we argue, to be used for the assessment of potential policy measure impacts and the identification of the next generation of innovation policy related measures. This new application of Foresight approaches is likely to arise in the near future. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,,"Gokhberg, L.; National Research University, Myasnitskaya st. 20, Russian Federation; email: lgokhberg@hse.ru",,,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",,,,,,9783642318276; 9783642318269,,,"English","Science, Technology and Innovation Policy for the Future: Potentials and Limits of Foresight Stud.",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884520778

Thus, attention to service research can enhance more than just our understanding of Foresight practice. Analysis of features of service systems can provide useful inputs at least general background, and sometimes absolutely critical elements for understanding social and organisational dimensions of many of the domains with which the exercises are concerned. Foresight practice can learn from the substantial experience that has accumulated in recent years about service systems, service design, service innovation, and related topics. So far it is only been able to highlight a few of the ways in which Foresight can be informed by service research. A new understanding of Foresight as an alone standing service is endorse able and shows potentials to improve Foresight’s reputation and potential contributions to science, technology and innovation policy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Karreman, D., Sturdy, A., Handley, K., Unpacking the client(S): Constructions, positions and client-consultant dynamics (2009) Scand J Manage, 25 (3), pp. 253-263; Baines, T.S., Lighfoot, H.W., Benedettini, O., Kay, J.M., The servitization of manufacturing.

But general principles for such evaluation have not yet been formulated. The purpose of this chapter is to identify the basic criteria and methods used in evaluating national Foresight exercises. Reviewing a range of evaluation efforts, it presents some interesting results for specific tasks, themes examined, methods and findings. A key motivation for these evaluations was to provide feedback to national Foresight organizations and identify areas for further development. Evaluation is used to guide Foresight and to learn lessons that can inform future projects (for example, lessons concerning simplifying implementation, involving business and social organizations, recognizing the objectives of participants and the need for better compliance with the methodology). We suggest a general methodology for assessing national Foresight programmes, together with a framework that can be used to improve the comparability of results of Foresight evaluation initiatives in different countries, and even to promote the standardization and upgrading of evaluation procedures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Alsan, A., Öner, M.A., Comparison of national Foresight studies by integrated Foresight management model (2004) Futures, 36 (8), pp. 889-902; Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting Foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of ‘Foresight systems’ (2008) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Bezold, C., Lessons from using scenarios for strategic Foresight (2010) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 77, pp. 1513-1518; Bohanec, M., Rajkovič, V., Semolič, B., Pogačnik, A., Knowledge-based portfolio analysis for project evaluation (1995) Inf Manage, 28, pp. 293-302; Calof, J., Evaluating future technology assessment - Canadian Case Study (2011) Paper Presented at the 4Th International Seville Conference on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis (FTA), Seville, , http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC64647.pdf, 12-13 May; Calof, J., Smith, J.E., Critical success factors for government led Foresight (2008) Paper Presented at the Third International Seville Seminar on Future Oriented Technology Analysis: Impacts and Implications for Policy and Decision-Making, Seville, , 16-17 October; Chan, L., Daim, T., Exploring the impact of technology Foresight studies on innovation: Case of BRIC countries (2012) Futures, 44 (6), pp. 618-630; (2010) Evaluation toolkit: A guide for environmental NGOs, , http://www.cleanairpartnership.org/building_evaluation_capacity_private; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to Foresight processes-new participative Foresight activities in Germany (2003) J Forecast, 22, pp. 93-111; Cuhls, K., Georghiou, L., Evaluating a participative Foresight process: “Futur-the German research dialogue” (2004) Res Eval, 13 (3), pp. 143-153; Destatte, P., Evaluation of Foresight: How to take long term impacts into consideration?

These efforts have evolved over time. The first projects aimed at providing information about future topics however more recent Foresight processes were directed to the BMBF and (indirectly) its portfolio. We examine the effects of these Foresight processes, leading us to explore the reasons for it being difficult in practice to really have an impact on policy making.

Foresight practitioners agree that there is still considerable scope for innovation and improvement in the field, however. How can conceptual frameworks and tools of Foresight be advanced so to better contribute to policymakers' search for Great Responses to the many Grand Challenges that confront contemporary societies? These fundamental questions were in focus in discussions at the Annual Conference on Foresight and S&T and Innovation Policy held on late October 2013 at the National Research University - Higher School of Economics (HSE) by the HSE Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge. The following topics were addressed in the agenda: the role of Foresight in S&T and innovation policy; networking and the use of Foresight results; Foresight for companies, sectors and technologies; S&T Foresight. Presentations were made by renowned experts from international organizations (OECD, UNESCO, UNIDO), worldwide leading Foresight think tanks Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, University of Manchester, UK; Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning (KISTEP); National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (NISTEP), Japan; University of Ottawa (Canada); Research Center for Futures Studies, University of Hawaii at Manoa, US; Institute for Technological Innovation, University of Pretoria, South Africa; Singularity University, US; Centre for Social Innovation, Austria, as well as from Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, HSE and a range of other organizations.",,,,,,,,,,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,,,,1995459X,,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902521799

It uses terms matching definitions supplied by other scholars. It argues that certain concepts underly the practice of foresight; although each foresight context and practitioner are unique, they come together under these concepts and give coherence to foresight and futures practice. Clarity regarding the conceptual framework of foresight practice strengthens the field and enables better decision making on the choice of tools to guide and validate practice. There are two principally distinct approaches to elaborating future strategies - open and closed. The first presumes quest and comparison of alternatives, behavior toward risk, and personal and social resilience. The second presumes risk aversion, or relying on a «proven» pattern while weeding out unsustained ideas and initiatives. The latter results in decreasing personal and social resilience. The article evaluates conditions fostering one or the other approach. An appreciation of the relative «closedness» or «openness» of any context allows looking for elements that either enable or block the shift from closed to open futures. Much of the foresight practitioner's work involves helping stakeholders undertake such an inquiry and seeding the resilience needed to manage both the turbulence and the ensuing uncertainty that results from this shift. The author believes that seeing foresight work and the futures thinking that accompanies it as promoting the journey from closed to open futures is a powerful insight into why foresight practice is so exciting.","Causality; Concepts; Effects; Foresight practice; Open and closed futures; Pattern; Patterning",,,,,,"Adams, D., (1982) Life, the Universe and Everything, , London: Pan Macmillan; Brandom, R.B., (2008) Between Saying and Doing: Towards An Analytic Pragmatism, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bussey, M., A world of exception: Exploring the thought of loren eiseley (2008) Death and Anti-Death: Thirty Years after Loren Eiseley, 5, pp. 165-196. , (ed.

The aim is to build a bridge between the existing information and knowledge base and the potentials for extending this into the longer term which are offered by Foresight studies. STI involve dynamic phenomena which are creating continuously changing conditions and requirements of the national innovation system (NIS) as a whole. Foresight can play an important role in reflecting and providing new insight into ongoing and emerging changes at different levels of this system. This interconnection of Foresight and STI (indicators), contributes to new perspectives on NIS with more explicit use of systems thinking. We consider the major challenges facing both STI indicators and Foresight indicators, and how existing and potential indicators from both spheres can be used to generate inspirations for development of the next generation of STI indicators, and also for future Foresight studies and indicators. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Abramo, G., D’ Angelo, C.A., Dicosta, F., Solazzi, M., University-industry collaboration in Italy: A bibliometric examination (2009) Technovation, 29, pp. 498-507; Archibugi, D., Pianta, M., Measuring technological change through patents and innovation surveys (1996) Technovation, 16 (9), pp. 451-468; Balconi, M., Breschi, S., Lissoni, F., Networks of inventors and the role of academia: An exploration of Italian patent data (2004) Res Policy, 33, pp. 127-145. , 2004; Bezold, C., Lessons from using scenarios for strategic foresight (2010) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 77, pp. 1513-1518; Blind, K., Regulatory foresight: Methodologies and selected applications (2008) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 75, pp. 496-516; Bloch, C., Assessing recent developments in innovation measurement: The third edition of the Oslo Manual (2007) Sci Public Pol, 34 (1), pp. 23-34; Braun, T., Dicispatonyi, I., Counting the gatekeepers of international science journals a worthwhile science indicator (2005) Curr Sci, 89 (9), pp. 1548-1551; Butcher, J., Jeffrey, P., The use of bibliometric indicators to explore industry-academia collaboration trends over time in the field of membrane use for water treatment (2005) Technovation, 25, pp. 1273-1280; Cantwell, J., Janne, O., Technological globalisation and innovative centres: The role of corporate technological leadership and locational hierarchy (1999) Res Policy, 28, pp. 119-144; Chan, L., Daim, T., Exploring the impact of technology foresight studies on innovation: Case of BRIC countries (2012) Futures, 44, pp. 618-630; Dlouha, J., Barton, A., Janouskova, S., Dlouhy, J., Social learning indicators in sustainability-oriented regional learning networks (2012) J Clean Prod, pp. 1-10. , http://dx.doi.org/10.10167j.jclepro.2012.07.023; Donovan, C., The qualitative future of research evaluation (2007) Sci Public Policy, 34 (8), pp. 585-597; Donovan, C., State of the art in assessing research impact: Introduction to a special issue.

With the use of Foresight studies, policy makers give a clear indication to the science, technology, and innovation community that policy making is considering a bottom-up approach rather than a purely top-down one. Foresight exercises go beyond simple predictions to become anticipatory intelligence, based on a wide diversity of viewpoints, and knowledge sources. Due to the varying nature and characteristics of Foresight studies, there is no one indicator that fits all different motivations, different methods and techniques, imply different outputs and outcomes. Hence the indicators we use to describe the studies may take on different meanings even quantitative indicators can require a great deal of interpretation.

The Delphi method and technology roadmapping have developed in different ways, and these two foresight methods are now attracting attention from both national governments and private companies. However, each method also has limitations when attempting to deal with accelerating technological complexity and sophistication and latent markets.

The chapter shows that Foresight in Russia has evolved from being just one on information source for S&T and innovation policy, towards a full-scale instrument for addressing key issues of these policies. Foresight work and its impacts on major policy challenges and instruments including development of human resources, bridging the gap between business, R&D and the state, increasing efficiency of budget R&D funding, stimulating innovation are discussed in light of the Russian experience.

In retrospect, the Foresight studies are also generally considered as something positive in most countries, with evaluations of these studies shows them to have had a significant impact on the structure of innovation, technology and science policy. For instance, the results of Foresight studies are frequently used to establish research and development priorities and to design R&D programmes. The correlational analysis and the evaluation studies thus together suggest that Foresight studies do have a supportive function and role on the innovation culture and awareness for innovation in a country. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"FinnSight 2015 The Outlook for Science, Technology and Society, 2006. , http://www.tekes.fi/julkaisut/Finnsight_2015_EN.pdf; Alsan, A., Oner, M.A., Comparison of national Foresight studies by integrated Foresight management model (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 889-902; Bezold, C., Lessons from using scenarios for strategic Foresight (2010) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 77, pp. 1513-1518; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: An overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Bleicher, K., Das Konzept integriertes Management (1991) Campus, , Frankfurt/New York; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Cachia, R., Compand, R., Da Costa, O., Grasping the potential of online social networks for Foresight (2007) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 74, pp. 1179-1203; Coates, J.F., Foresight in federal government policy making (1985) Futures Res Q, 1, pp. 29-53; Cuhls, K., Was kommt nach Delphi’98?

This framework recognises the complexities that emerge due to multifaceted interplays between the Social, Technological, Economic, Ecological, Political and Value (STEEPV) systems. To conducting Foresight systemically, we need to undertake a set of systemic’ thought experiments, in which systems (e.g. human and social systems, industrial/sectoral systems, and innovation systems) are understood and modelled, and hopefully intervened in, for a successful change programme. These experiments are conducted in a series of iterative phases that we label (1) Intelligence (scoping, surveying and scanning phase) (2) Imagination (creative and diverging phase), (3) Integration (ordering and converging phase), (4) Interpretation (strategy phase), (5) Intervention (action phase), and (6) Impact (evaluation phase); (7) an Interaction phase (participation) goes on throughout the activity. The paper describes each of the phases and proposes a set of quantitative and qualitative methods, which can be combined to form research, policy, technology, and innovation paths. The ideas discussed in the light of two Systemic Foresight cases, dealing with Higher Education and Renewable Energy sectors. SFM was used to provide a methodological orientation for these the Foresight exercises, where a variety of methods were selected and combined in line with the objectives of and available resources for the Foresight exercises. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Sanders, T.I., Identifying sys-tems’ new initial conditions as influence points for future (2006) Foresight, 8 (3), pp. 28-35; Ackoff, R.L., (1981) Creating the Corporate Future, , Wiley, New York; Argyyis, C., (1976) Increasing Leadership Effectiveness, , Wiley-Interscience, New York; Argyyis, C., Schon, D., (1978) Organisational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective, , Addison-Wesley, Reading; Bausch, K.C., Roots and branches: A brief, picturesque, personal history of systems thinking (2002) Syst Res Behav Sci, 19, pp. 417-428; Beer, S., (1979) Heart of the Enterprise, , Wiley, Chichester; Bertalanffy, L.V., Vorschlag zweier sehr allgemeiner biologischer Gesetze -Studien uber theoretische Biologie, III (1929) Biologisches Zentralblatt, 49, pp. 83-111; Checkland, P., (1981) Systems Thinking, Systems Practice, , Wiley, Chichester; Churchman, C.W., (1968) The Systems Approach, , Dell Publishing, New York; Churchman, C.W., Ackoff, R.L., Arnoff, E.L., (1957) Introduction to Operations Research, , Wiley, New York; (2002) Defra’s Horizon Scanning Strategy for Science, Science Directorate, Defra Scince Strategy Team, , http://www.cgee.org.br/atividades/redirKori/284, Last visited on 13 Mar 2012; Gunderson, L., Holling, C.S., (2001) Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, , Island Press, Washington; Hammond, D., Exploring the genealogy of systems thinking (2002) Syst Res Behav Sci, 19, pp. 429-439; Holling, C.S., (2000) Theories for Sustainable Futures, Conservation Ecology, 4 (7). , http://www.consecol.org/vol4/iss2/art7, Last visited on 20 May 2011; Holling, C.S., Understanding the complexity of economic, ecological and social systems (2001) Ecosystems, 4, pp. 390-405; Jackson, M.C., Critical systems thinking and practice (2001) Eur J Oper Res, 128, pp. 233-244; Kay, J.J., Reiger, H.A., Boyle, M., Francis, G., An ecosystem approach for sustainability: Addressing the challenge of complexity (1999) Futures, 31, pp. 721-742; Koestler, A., (1967) The Ghost in the Machine, , Macmillan, New York; Loveridge, D., (2009) Foresight: The Art and Science of Anticipating The Future, , Routledge, London; Loveridge, D., Saritas, O., Reducing the democratic deficit in institutional Foresight programmes: A case for critical systems thinking in nanotechnology (2009) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 76 (9), pp. 1208-1221; Martin, B., Foresight in science and technology policy (1995) Technol Anal Strateg Manage, 7 (2), pp. 139-168; Meadows, D.H., Meadows, D.L., Randers, J., Bahrens, W., (1972) The Limits to Growth: A Report for the Club of Rome’s Project on the Predicament of Mankind, , Universe Books, New York; Miles, I., Keenan, M., (2002) Practical Guide to Regional Foresight in the UK, , Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg; Modarres, M., Cheon, S.W., Function-centred modelling of engineering systems using the goal tree -success tree technique and functional primitives (1999) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 64, pp. 181-200; Papon, P., Science and technology policy in France: 1981-1986 (1988) Minerva, 26 (4), pp. 493-511; Roe, E., Taking complexity seriously: Policy analysis (1998) Triangulation and Sustainable Development, , Kluwer, Boston; Salo, A., Konnola, T., Hjelt, M., Responsiveness in Foresight management: Reflections from the Finnish food and drink industry (2004) Int J Foresight Innov Policy, 1 (1-2), pp. 70-88; Saritas, O., Smith, J.E., The big picture -trends, drivers, wild cards, discontinuities and weak signals (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 292-312; Simon, H., (1957) Models of Man, , Wiley, New York; Simon, H., The architecture of complexity (1962) Proc am Philos Soc, 106, pp. 467-482; Van Dijk, J., Foresight studies: A new approach in participatory policy making in the Netherlands (1991) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 40 (3), pp. 223-234; Vickers, G., (1965) The Art of Judgement: A Study of Policy Making, , Chapman & Hall, London","Saritas, O.; University of Manchester, Oxford Road, United Kingdom; email: Ozcan.Saritas@manchester.ac.uk",,,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",,,,,,9783642318276; 9783642318269,,,"English","Science, Technology and Innovation Policy for the Future: Potentials and Limits of Foresight Stud.",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943367042

The concept of scenario method, its evolution, the state of the art of the Polish foresight studies and the critical analysis of the application of this method have been presented. From the questionnaire results the authors have identified (i) the approach used in scenario construction, (ii) the most important phases of scenario construction, (iii) the interconnection of scenario method with other methods of scenario construction, (iv) the profile of experts involved in foresight projects, (v) the profile of experts involved in scenario construction, (vi) the application of the triangulation principle in scenario construction, (vii) the application of wild cards in scenario construction and techniques to identify them, (viii) the average time of scenario construction process, (ix) the linkage of scenarios to other documents, (x) the number of scenarios elaborated upon, and (xi) the main difficulties in the process of scenario construction. To achieve article aims there have been used the following research methods: a literature review, the method of critical analysis and logical construction, survey research, the status of Polish foresight projects, interim and final report analysis.

In order to explore these two factors, we designed a prospective clinical study comparing with relative (INVOS®) and absolute (Foresight®) rScO2 measurements.MethodsForty-two consenting patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were included. Two INVOS and two Foresight sensors continuously registered rScO2. was measured continuously via a pulmonary artery catheter. Data were assessed by within- and between-group comparisons and correlation analysis.ResultsA similar time delay of 19 (4) and 18 (4) s was found for compared with rScO2 measurements by Foresight and INVOS, respectively, during haemodynamic changes. After adjusting for this time delay, the correlation between and rS cO2 increased from r=0.25 to 0.75 (P&lt;0.001) for Foresight, and from r=0.28 to 0.73 (P&lt;0.001) for INVOS. Comparison of Foresight and INVOS revealed significant differences in absolute rS cO2 values (range 58-89% for Foresight and 28-95% for INVOS). Changes in rScO2 in response to acute haemodynamic alterations were significantly more pronounced with INVOS compared with Foresight (P&lt;0.001).ConclusionsConsidering the important time delay with, rScO2 seems to reflect more appropriately acute haemodynamic alterations. This might suggest its use as a valid alternative to invasive monitoring of tissue oxygen saturation. Relative and absolute rS cO2 measurements demonstrated significant differences in measured rScO2 values and in the magnitude of rS cO2 changes during haemodynamic alterations. © 2012 © The Author [2012].

This paper provides a comprehensive insight into environmental foresight projects all over the world based on the specific analysis of the main global environmental hotspots. This analysis helped to discover more than 40 regional hotspots in view of the global environmental sustainability. Approximately 33% of these hotspots are in Asia; 26% in the USA and Africa, and 7% in Oceania and Europe. The key objective of this study is to highlight global environmental sustainability problems, based on the criteria such as biodiversity, standard of living, CO2 emissions, or GDP per capita, and identify regional foresight projects. The data from the UN Statistics Division, UN National Human Development Report Unit, UN Environment Programme, IMF Statistics, and others were used for the analysis of environmental hotspots. While human development index and GDP per capita were used as the measures of social standard of living, biodiversity and amount of produced CO2 emissions were used as the measures of certain environmental quality and sustainability.

However until today no common understanding has been articulated on what these policy fields are and how they are correlated in daily practice of policy making. The book thus pursuits a completely new approach, which goes much beyond existing practices. For the first time the concept of evidence based science, technology and innovation policy making is elaborated and put into context with Foresight studies. Foresight studies are commonly understood as a measure supporting governments, public agencies and companies in designing future oriented strategies.

It is a sophisticated, potentially uniquely human capacity, with tremendous adaptive consequences. Here we review what is currently known about its development through early childhood. We tackle this from two distinct perspectives. First, we present the first systematic evaluation of the development of purported components of mental scenario building as highlighted by a theater metaphor: the stage, the playwright, the set, the actors, the director, the executive producer, and the broadcaster. We find that, although there are diverse developmental trajectories, by 4 years of age children have acquired the basic cognitive components required to mentally construct specific future events. Second, we examine recent attempts to test children's episodic foresight more directly and find that results are in line with those examining the development of required components. This is not to say that children younger than four have no inkling of upcoming events or that older children have nothing left to learn about constructing the future. Episodic foresight, and its neurocognitive foundations, continues to develop throughout childhood. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.","Mental time travel; Planning; Preparation; Prospective memory; Prudence; Scene construction","article; child development; childhood; cognition; episodic memory; human; play; prospective memory",,,,,"Dennett, D.C., Kinsbourne, M., Time and the observer-the where and when of consciousness in the brain (1992) Behav.

Key insights and messages are often picked up from one expert group to the next and from one policy domain to another, creating significant spin-off effects. Example of influential approaches include the rupture/disruption theme (picked up by the first SCAR foresight group and elaborated in other European exercises), and the grand challenge approach (flagged by the ERA Rationales group and taken up in the design of Horizon 2020). Transformation by design using policy shocks is being increasingly implemented at European and national level through the use of horizon scanning and detection of wild cards and weak signals of major disruptions underway or on the horizon. FP7 Blue Skies projects focused on refining the tools for identifying wilds cards and weak signals, and on reflecting on their significance in relation to addressing European grand societal challenges. These projects highlighted the need for an ongoing facility at European level to map and detect signals and to understand and analyse the interactions and impacts of such trends and drivers in the European and global context. The establishment of a centralised foresight and scanning facility with the Joint Research Centre central offices in Brussels, and of the European Forum on Forward-looking Activities, can be seen as significant steps that build on the earlier Foresight studies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Konnola, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., Van Rij, V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: Lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Sci Public Policy, 39 (2), pp. 208-221; Cassingena Harper, J., (2002) The Relevance of EU Regional Foresight Experiences for Small Candidate Countries, , Paper prepared for EU HLG on Regional Foresight, April 2002; Cassingena Harper, J., Georghiou, L., The targeted and unforeseen impacts of foresight on innovation policy: The eFORESEE Malta case study (2005) Int J Foresight Innov Policy, 2 (1), pp. 84-103; Cunningham, P., Karakasidou, A., Innovation and societal challenges (2010) Pro Inno Europe Thematic Report No, p. 1; Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: Insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) TASM, 20 (3), pp. 369-387; (2008) Challenging Europe’s Research -Rationales for the European Research Area (ERA, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/pdf/eg7-era-rationales-final-report_en.pdf, report of the ERA Expert Group, EUR 23326 EN.

Different from previous studies in which players update their strategies according to the imitation rule, in this article, the strategies are updated with limited foresight. We find that two absorbing states-full cooperation and full defection-can be reached, assuming that players can delete interaction relations unilaterally, but new relations can only be created with the mutual consent of both partners. Simulation experiments show that high levels of cooperation in large populations can be achieved when the temptation to defect in PDG is low. Moreover, we explore the factors which influence the level of cooperation.

It suggests some reasons that decisions are often made with good backsight and less foresight. We consider the frameworks for organisational strategy adopted by many organisations, the roles of professionals in organisations. There are two distinct archetypes of people in terms of management style and approach to the professional duties - ""foxes"" and ""hedgehogs"". The ""hedgehogs"" make up the majority of employees. They prefer to follow the ""proven"" patterns enabling the operational activities of the organisation, but are weedy in adopting the changes. The ""foxes"" in their turn have a flexible mindset, they are suspicious of commitment to any single way of seeing an issue, and are relatively ready to recalibrate their view when unexpected events cast doubt on what they had previously believed to be true. Many futurists display ""fox"" -like characteristics. We describe the characteristics of an organisation able effectively to harness the potential of both archetypes and take foresight into its strategy. The paper thus puts forward a framework for connecting foresight to strategic decisions in organisations, using the example of the work being done with the European Commission's EFFLA (European Forum on Forward Looking Activities). We propose a four-stage strategy cycle process for aligning to the EC's research and innovation policy cycle. The first two stages, strategic intelligence (horizon scanning) and sense-making, require individual expert contributions and are in focus by EFFLA. In turn, selecting priorities and implementation are up to the policy- and decision-makers. We consider the suggested steps at each stage and the linkages between them. In particular this scheme should allow the EC flexibly to adjust the milestones of the Horizon 2020 framework programme and to outline its successor, Horizon II.","Decision-making; European Commission; Foresight; Foxes; Futures studies; Hedgehogs; Horizon scanning; Implementatio; Policy-making; Priority setting; Sense-making",,,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Multi-ontology, sense-making and the emergence of the future (2009) Futures, 41, pp. 279-283; Amanatidou, E., Butter, M., Carabias, V., Könnölä, T., Leis, M., Saritas, O., Schaper-Rinkel, P., Van Rij, V., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: Lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39, pp. 208-221. , DOI:10. 1093/scipol/scs017eScholarID:168071; Berlin, I., (1953) The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History, , New York: Simon & Schuster; De Geus, A., (2002) The Living Company, , Boston, London: Nicholas Brealey Publishing; (2010) Europe 2020, , http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm, European Commission, 12.07.2013; (2010) Global Europe 2030-2050: State of the Art of International Forward Looking Activities beyond 2030, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/social-sciences/pdf/fla-2030-2050-state-of- the-art-synthesis_en.pdf, Düsseldorf: «Global Europe 2030-2050» Expert Group, European Commission, 02. 02. 2013; Godet, M., (2007) Creating Futures, Scenario Planning As A Management Tool, , New York: Columbia University Press; Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1996) Competing for the Future, , Boston: Harvard Business School Press; Ilbury, C., Sunter, C., (2001) The Mind of A Fox: Scenario Planning in Action, , Cape Town: Human & Rousseau; Johnson, S., (2010) Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation, , London: Allen Lane; (2012) Six Trends Point to Changes with A Wide Impact on Business, , MCE.

Many futurists are developing foresight of future technologies based on Delphi studies, unfolding history, brainstorming, expert surveys, trend analysis, data mining, and so on. However, formalizing these processes is still a necessary task. In this paper, we introduce the NEST (New and Emerging Signals of Trends) model developed by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI). The NEST collects information from worldwide expert networks and detects the weak signals of emerging future trends systematically, based on massive data analysis, inference techniques, and Delphi studies, to support the development of foresight of future research and technology. The NEST model combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. In the quantitative approach stages, NEST uses clustering, pattern recognition, and cross-impact analysis using a Bayesian network. In the stages of qualitative approaches, NEST conducts environmental scanning, brainstorming, and a Delphi study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bayesian network; Delphi study; Emerging trend; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative analysis; Weak signal","Bayesian analysis; decision making; Delphi analysis; detection method; future prospect; model; quantitative analysis; research and development; science and technology; technology adoption; trend analysis; Korea",,,,,"Zhang, D., Extracting social and community intelligence from digital footprints: an emerging research area (2010) UIC'10 Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, , Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, Xi'an, China; Chen, W., Social network analysis supporting collaborative knowledge building (2009) SOCINFO '09 Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Social Informatics, , IEEE Computer Society; Zhuhadar, L., Visual knowledge representation of conceptual semantic networks (2010) Social Network Anal.

This chapter presents an approach to identifying the most promising nanoindustry product groups, the technological breakthroughs associated with these, and prospects for emergence of nanotechnology markets. In the Russian context, it suggested that significant niches in these nanotechnology markets can be established, by making an measured choice of priorities and focusing efforts on achieving these. Acting upon such priorities requires coordinated efforts from key actors throughout the life cycle of nanoproducts from development to commercialization, not just in the research phase. We argue that the effectiveness of the measures that are taken will depend on the extent to which recommendations based on Foresight studies are taken on board in management decisions affecting the nascent nanoindustry’s scientific, technological, and market development. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Annual report (2011) (2012) European Photovoltaic Industry Association, , http://www.epia.org/publications/epiapublications.html, Accessed 12 Apr 2012; World in transition -a social contract for sustainability (2011) WBGU, , http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2011-a-social-contract/, 2011, Accessed 14 Mar 2012; (2009), http://eng.thesaurus.rusnano.com/wiki/article1377, Accessed 26 Sept 2012; Gokhberg, L., Fursov, K., Karasev, O., Nanotechnology development and regulatory framework: The case of Russia (2012) Technovation, 32, pp. 161-162. , (in Russian); Roadmap Using Nanotechnology in the production of carbon fibers and related products (2010) Research Study Sponsored by RUSNANO, , http://rusnano.com/ipload/oldnews/files/33652/current.pdf; Karasev, O., Rudnik, P., Sokolov, A., Emerging technology-related markets in Russia: The case of nanotechnology (2011) J East West Bus, 17 (2-3), pp. 101-119; (2010) The recession’s Impact on Nanotechnology, , http://www.luxresearchinc.com/blog/page/16/, Accessed 04 Mar 2012; (2003) Energy Strategy of Russia until 2020, , Russian; (2012) Strategy of the Development of Russia until 2020, , Russian; Technology roadmap.

It is likely that ""peaker"" plants will be a crucial dispatchable resource for compensating for the variations in renewable supply. Thus, it is important to understand the strategic incentives of peaker plants and their potential for exploiting market power due to having responsive supply. To this end, we study an oligopolistic two-settlement market comprising of two types of generation (baseloads and peakers) where there is perfect foresight. We characterize symmetric equilibria in this context via closedform expressions. However, we also show that, when the system is capacity-constrained, there may not exist equilibria in which baseloads and peakers play symmetric strategies. This happens because of opportunities for both types of generation to exploit market power to increase prices. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Control; Base-loads; Closed-form expression; Forward market; Market Power; Perfect foresights; Renewable resource; Commerce",,,,,"Ackermann, T., (2005) Wind Power in Power Systems, 140. , Wiley Online Library; Stoft, S., (2002) Power System Economics, , IEEE press Piscataway, NJ; Harris, C., (2006) Electricity Markets: Pricing, Structures and Economics, 328. , Wiley; Kirschen, D., Strbac, G., (2005) Fundamentals of Power System Economics, , Wiley Online Library; Puga, J.N., The importance of combined cycle generating plants in integrating large levels of wind power generation (2010) The Electricity Journal, 23 (7), pp. 33-44; De Meo, E.A., Jordan, G.A., Kalich, C., King, J., Milligan, M.R., Murley, C., Oakleaf, B., Schuerger, M.J., Accommodating wind's natural behavior (2007) Power and Energy Magazine, 5 (6), pp. 59-67. , IEEE; Smith, J.C., Milligan, M.R., De Meo, E.A., Parsons, B., Utility wind integration and operating impact state of the art (2007) Power Systems, 22 (3), pp. 900-908. , IEEE Transactions on; Corporation, E., Avista corporation wind integration study (2007) Avista Corporation, Tech.

Yet, in this paper we seek to explore why it is that despite our increased knowledge of disaster causation - aviation security systems still remain vulnerable to future exploitation by adaptive terrorists and other threat groups. We adopt a novel approach, and present early directions of how we apply the benefits of high level appreciations of socio-technical and biological eco-systems to existing complex aviation transportation security systems. We propose that by approaching aviation security as a complex socio-technical eco-system, it offers an opportunity to think beyond conventional methodologies to improve system performance in a way that, hitherto, would not have been possible. The paper concerns itself with the ability for aviation socio-technical eco-systems to hold the capacity to proactively identify and mitigate pathogenic errors and violations. This narrow view is juxtaposed with identifying methods of reducing error creation 'before' they become system vulnerabilities. To address this problem, the paper concludes that a fresh approach, both conceptually and operationally, is required to understand that 'true' foresight of latent vulnerabilities can only be achieved by a system which is 'intelligent' and 'self-aware', in other words to identify and modify hostile pathogens before they are exploited. The development of true foresight in aviation security systems is critical to the prevention of future terrorist attacks. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Aviation security; Foresight; Human error; Security technologies; Socio-technical eco-system; Transportation security",,,,,,"Aini, M.S., Fakhrul-Razi, A., Development of socio-technical disaster model (2010) Safety Sci, 48, pp. 1286-1295; Badham, R., Clegg, C., Wall, T., Socio-technical theory (2000) Handbook of Ergonomics, pp. 23-32. , W.

At a time when society's expectations for the environmental and social performance of companies are becoming more stringent, mineral production in Australia has become more difficult and expensive - issues that are often disguised by (and overlooked as a result of) high resource prices and an outwardly buoyant economy. Difficulty and expense are characterised not by the absence of resources, but by declining ore grades, substantially increasing mine waste, rising energy consumption, and falling multi-factor productivity. Together, social changes and production challenges are reinforcing the recognition that business as usual cannot deliver on the sustainability imperative. Technological development has been an important focus in seeking to address many of the challenges facing the Australian minerals industry, but this alone has not been adequate, and may not be the panacea of the future. Research exploring the future of minerals production and its implications for society and the economy must be accompanied by foresight into the long-term strategic challenges, future scenarios, social, economic and regional contexts where these implications will play out.This paper documents how foresight methods were used to facilitate a conversation between mining industry stakeholders and experts on the future of the industry in Australia, and to develop a shared vision of the future and recommendations for how to achieve a sustainable mining industry and one which contributes to a sustainable Australian economy. We articulate the implications of sustainability for the mining sector in Australia with respect to a vision to 2040, and discuss mechanisms to secure long-term national benefit for Australia from its finite mineral resources. We demonstrate that realising benefits from a mineral endowment over several decades requires considered and forward-looking resource governance, including a National Minerals Strategy. It should be characterised by innovative policy decisions and business models that engage communities, government and the private sector in not only the rhetoric, but also the business of sustainability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Australia; Foresight; Minerals; Peak minerals; Resource governance; Sustainability","governance approach; mineral resource; mining industry; resource management; stakeholder; sustainability; Australia",,,,,"(2009), ABARE, Australian Commodity Statistics 2009.

Even though traffic flow information is better than no traffic information, drivers still face dangerous congested traffic flow. Several approaches have addressed short-term traffic information in which a stigmergy-based approach is employed as an indirect communication method for cooperation among distributed agents and for managing traffic congestion. Recently, advances in Intelligent Transport Systems suggest a future in which vehicles handle their own positions. Our foresight-route- providing method combines a previous method that utilized the past travel times of vehicles for decentralized traffic congestion management. We assume that all vehicles collect dynamic traffic conditions in decentralized processing environments as real implementation environments during the simulations. In our simulations, we demonstrate that our assignment route strategies have the potential for significant efficiency and stability for traffic flow in decentralized processing environments that can collect dynamic traffic conditions from the previous few minutes and estimate the vehicle positions after a few minutes in only limited links. In this paper, we evaluate the differences between centralized and decentralized processing environments and investigate how the ratio of probe vehicles that are equipped with such devices as navigation systems is related to efficient and stable traffic flow. We confirmed that a route assignment strategy contributes to the stable efficiency of the total travel time. With more probe vehicles, assignment route strateges becomes efficient in our approach. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Intelligent agents; Motor transportation; Navigation systems; Probes; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Assignment strategies; Congestion management; Dynamic traffic conditions; Indirect communication; Intelligent transport systems; Processing environments; Stability evaluation; Traffic flow information; Vehicles",,,,,"Morikawa, T., Miwa, T., Preliminary analysis on dynamic route choice behavior using probe-vehicle data (2006) Journal of Advanced Transportation; Japan, I., Passage Result, Information of Suspension of Traffic, , http://www.its-jp.org/saigai/; Dorigo, M., Gambardella, L.M., Ant colony system: A cooperative learning approach to the traveling salesman problem (1997) IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation; Chen, B., Cheng, H.H., A review of the applications of agent technology in traffic and transportation systems (2010) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Dorigo, M., Stutzle, T., (2004) Ant Colony Optimization, , MIT Press; Claes, R., Holvoet, T., Weyns, D., A decentralized approach for anticipatory vehicle routing using delegate multiagent systems (2011) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 12 (2), pp. 364-373. , IEEE Transactions on june; Narzt, W., Wilflingseder, U., Pomberger, G., Kolb, D., Hortner, H., Self-organising congestion evasion strategies using ant-based pheromones (2010) Intelligent Transport Systems, IET, 4 (1), pp. 93-102. , march; Dallmeyer, J., Schumann, R., Lattner, A.D., Timm, I.J., Don't go with the ant flow: Ant-inspired traffic routing in urban environments (2012) The Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Agents in Traffic and Transportation (ATT2012); Ito, T., Kanamori, R., Takahashi, J., Maestre, I.M., De La Hoz, E., The comparison of stigmergy strategies for decentralized traffic congestion control: Preliminary results (2012) The Proceedings of the 12th Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI2012); Kanamori, R., Ito, T., Takahashi, J., Evaluation of anticipatory stigmergy strategies for traffic management (2012) Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC); Sheffi, Y., (1985) Urban Transportation Networks: Equilibrium Analysis with Mathematical Programming Methods, 1 (1). , Prentice-Hall; Marfia, G., Roccetti, M., Vehicular congestion detection and short-term fore-casting: A new model with results (2011) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology; Wolfram, S., (1986) Theory and Application of Cellular Automata, , World.

A modeling study was applied to a three-reservoir system on the Iowa and Des Moines Rivers to estimate the best possible operation of these reservoirs (with ""perfect foresight"") and to determine whether or not tandem operating rules would provide appreciable benefits. A linear programming (LP) model was developed and the model treats the flood-operation problem as one of finding a system-wide set of releases that minimize total system penalties for too much or too little release storage and flow.

For this purpose, information technology (IT) based system with applying environmental management theories has become an emerging means of promoting smarter services for Green. However, how to strategically generalize key requirements for designing such IT-based environmental services is crucial but merely discussed. To systematically analyze essential needs of planning services, a Define-Analyze-Sketch-Plan (DASP) framework referring to various concepts including strategy management, technology foresight, contemporary environmental management system models, value engineering, and signpost-based decision making is introduced in this paper. Through performing the DASP, V&T Network, and N&F Matrix are delivered to sketch initiatives for system development and strategic signposts for risk management. In practice, the proposed process-oriented DASP can not only benefit system design for IT-based Green services but also indicate a valuable research direction towards Environmental Management and Engineering.

Mickiewicza 30, Kraków, 30-050, Poland, International Centre for Decision Sciences and Forecasting Progress, Poland","This paper presents a theory of anticipatory networks that originates from anticipatory models of consequences in multicriteria decision problems. When making a decision, the decision maker takes into account the anticipated outcomes of each future decision problem linked by the causal relations with the present one. In a network of linked decision problems, the causal relations are defined between time-ordered nodes. The scenarios of future consequences of each decision are modeled by multiple vertices starting from an appropriate node. The network is supplemented by one or more relations of anticipation, or future feedback, which describe a situation where decision makers take into account the anticipated results of some future optimization problems while making their choice. So arises a multigraph of decision problems linked causally and by one or more anticipation relation, termed here the anticipatory network. We will present the properties of anticipatory networks and propose a method of reducing, transforming and using them to solve current decision problems. Furthermore, it will be shown that most anticipatory networks can be regarded as superanticipatory systems, i.e. systems that are anticipatory in the Rosen sense and contain a future model of at least one other anticipatory system. The anticipatory networks can also be applied to filter the set of future scenarios in a foresight exercise. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.","anticipatory networks; casuals fields; foresight; scenarios; superanticipatory systems",,,,,,"Skulimowski, A.M.J., (1985) Found.

Starting in early childhood, every individual appears to construct for himself an internalized model of the world, however fragmentary; foresight, and the capacity to plan and predict, are based upon his manipulation of the components of this model. Usually, the thought processes involved occur without conscious effort or difficulty, but when a serious discrepancy arises between the model and hard facts, the individual is forced to recognize the falseness of his conceptual construct. This acceptance, and the subsequent modifications of the model, often give rise to severe emotional disturbances. © 1972 Teodor Shanin and individual contributors and 2018 New Foreword Teodor Shanin.

We distinguish between a sophisticated and naive representative agent. Even when underlying preferences are monotone and convex, at given prices, we show by example that the induced preference of the sophisticated representative agent over choices in first-period markets is both non-convex and satiated.

Previous empirical research in Australia has suggested that general physicians and surgeons may use analgesic or sedative infusions with ambiguous intentions, their actions sometimes approximating 'slow euthanasia'. In this paper, we report findings from a qualitative study of 18 Australian palliative care medical specialists, using in-depth interviews to address the use of sedation at the end of life. The majority of subjects were agnostic or atheistic. In contrast to their colleagues in acute medical practice, these Australian palliative care specialists were almost unanimously committed to distinguishing their actions from euthanasia. This commitment appeared to arise principally from the need to maintain a clear professional role, and not obviously from an ideological opposition to euthanasia. While some respondents acknowledged that there are difficult cases that require considered reflection upon one's intention, and where there may be some 'mental gymnastics,' the nearly unanimous view was that it is important, even in these difficult cases, to cultivate an intention that focuses exclusively on the relief of symptoms. We present four narratives of 'terminal' sedation - cases where sedation was administered in significant doses just before death, and may well have hastened death. Considerable ambiguities of intention were evident in some instances, but the discussion around these clearly exceptional cases illustrates the importance of intention to palliative care specialists in maintaining their professional roles. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Double effect; End-of-life; Euthanasia; Hypnotics and sedatives; Intention; Qualitative research; Terminal care","hypnotic sedative agent; adult; aged; article; Australia; behavior; clinical practice; ethics; euthanasia; female; human; male; medical ethics; methodology; middle aged; palliative therapy; qualitative research; terminal care; verbal communication; Adult; Aged; Australia; Double Effect Principle; Euthanasia; Female; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Narration; Palliative Care; Physician's Practice Patterns; Qualitative Research; Terminal Care",,"Hypnotics and Sedatives",,,"Kuhse, H., No' to the Intention/Foresight Distinction in Medical End-of-Life Decisions (1997) Med Law, 16, pp. 643-649; Gillon, R., When Doctors Might Kill their Patients: Foreseeing is not Necessarily the Same as Intending (1999) BMJ, 318, pp. 1431-1432; Doyal, L., The Moral Character of Clinicians or the Best Interests of Patients?

In Experiment 1, receipt of such outcome knowledge was found to increase the postdicted likelihood of reported events and change the perceived relevance of eventdescriptive data, regardless of the likelihood of the outcome and the truth of the report. Judges were, however, largely unaware of the effect that outcome knowledge had on their perceptions. As a result, they overestimated what they would have known without outcome knowledge (Experiment 2), as well as what others (Experiment 3) actually did know without outcome knowledge.

His views on the harmonisation of African languages, mother-tongue education, the position of English and the importance of literacy have shaped academic and policy debates since the early 1990s. Visionaries are able to combine insight with foresight and so imagine a different way forward. In this way they change what Roger Simon describes as the 'horizon of possibility'. This article examines Alexander's positions critically in relation to questions of power, identity, access and social transformation, in order to understand both their take-up and their rejection.

Mountain ecosystems and their inhabitants are among the most vulnerable to climate change. This paper seeks to explain migration drivers in specific mountain regions in the context of climate change based on Foresight’s conceptual framework. A climate change sensitive field named Shangnan County in southern Shaanxi Province is chosen as the case study area to investigate local migration drivers. A series of qualitative research methods is employed in the case study including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions. The evidence of survey suggests that migration decisions are not only shaped by macro factors in aspects of environmental, economics, demographic, social, politics and psychological, but also influenced by placed-related barriers and facilitating mechanisms and personal characteristics. © 2013 Shandong Normal University.","Climate change; Migration driver; Mountain region",,,,,,"Adler, L.L., Gielen, U.P., (2003) Migration: Immigration and Emigration in International Perspective, , Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing; Bocker, A., Chain migration over legally closed borders: Settled immigrants as bridgeheads and gatekeepers (1994) Netherlands’ J Social Sci, 30 (2), pp. 87-106; Buhrer, S., (1997) Soziales Kapital Und Wanderungsentscheidungen, , Hamburg: Verlag Kovac; Baneijee, B., Social networks in the migration process: Empirical evidence on chain migration in India (1983) J Dev Areas, 17 (2), pp. 185-196; Beniston, M., Climatic change in mountain regions: A review of possible impacts (2003) Climatic Change, 59 (1), pp. 5-31; Bernard, H.R., (2012) Social Research Methods: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches., , London: SAGE; Black, R., (2001) Environmental Refugees: Myth Or Reality?, , Brighton: UNHCR; Black, R., Adger, W.N., Arnell, N.W., Dercon, S., Geddes, A., Thomas, D., The effect of environmental change on human migration (2011) Global Env Change, 21, pp. S3-S11; Bogardi, J., Warner, K., Here comes the flood (2008) Nature Reports Climate Change, 2 (14), pp. 9-11; Boyd, M., Family and personal networks in international migration: Recent developments and new agendas (1989) Int Migr Rev, 23 (3), pp. 638-670; Brodnig, G., Prasad, V., (2010) A View from the Top: Vulnerability in Mountain Systems, , Social development notes, Washington, DC: World Bank; Carr, E.R., Placing the environment in migration: Environment, economy, and power in Ghana’s Central Region (2005) Env Plan A, 37 (5), pp. 925-946; Castles, S., (2002) Environmental Change and Forced Migration: Making Sense of the Debate, , Oxford: UNHCR; Castles, S., Miller, M.J., International population movements in the modern world (2003) Int Migr Rev, 37 (4), pp. 1-15; Deshingkar, P., Internal migration, poverty and development in Asia: Including the excluded (2006) IDS Bull, 37 (3), pp. 88-100; El-Hinnawi, E., (1985) Environmental Refugees, , Nairobi: UNEP; Faist, T., (1997) Selected Students in International Migration and Immigrant Incorporation, , Chapter 3 The crucial meso level.

However, the dynamics of ICT development depends on the global challenges and broader trends that define long-term S&T priorities. What factors that will influence the future of the ICT industry? What technological solutions will determine its characteristics in the next 15-20 years? These and similar questions were considered by the HSE ISSEK specialists in co-operation with the colleagues from other research entities while investigating trends in S&T at the global and national levels. The experts have analyzed socio-economic and S&T challenges affecting the ICT sector, advanced R&D fields, markets for innovative products and services, estimated the «windows of opportunities» for Russia. As a result, the strategic directions of blueprint research which ensure the basis for the creation of innovative products and new markets for the medium- and long-term (beyond 2020) perspective. Foresight results have been validated by the representatives of leading companies, research centers, universities and international organizations. Among the solutions expected in the period up to 2030 are the prototypes of systems implementing the new computing principles and multi-language software for extraction and formalization of knowledge, technologies dealing with «big data», new analytical tools (personal analytic systems, means of the real time data processing, mobile analytics, etc.). Markets for novel technology solutions are expected to be rapidly growing in healthcare, energy, engineering and transport, as well as in personal usage of ICT products and services. The study allows to conclude that in the medium to long term, the ICT sector will retain a high growth dynamic and will have transformative impact on virtually all areas of human life. The life cycle of technologies, related products and services will shorten. In this context, R&D development plays a crucial role for keeping up with competitors. Russian science has a certain potential in much of the considered areas, although one can hardly perceive Russia as gaining global leadership. A breakthrough level of research is observed, for example, in telecommunication technologies (communication, networking and content distribution).","Global challenges; Information and communication technologies; Long-term foresight; Priorities; S&T capacities; Trends",,,,,,"Bartels, A.H., (2009) Smart Computing Drives: The New Era of IT Growth, , Cambridge, MA: Forrester Research, Inc; (2012) GeSI SMARTer 2020: The Role of ICT in Driving A Sustainable Future, , BCG, Boston: Boston Consulting Group; Cagnin, C., Havas, A., Saritas, O., Future-oriented technology analysis: Its potential to address disruptive transformations (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80, pp. 379-385; Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Boston: Harvard Business School Press; (2011) Issledovanie Vzaimosvyazei Vazhneishikh Parametrov Sotsial'no- ekonomicheskogo, Nauchno-tekhnologicheskogo i Innovatsionnogo Razvitiya Na Period Do 2030 Goda, , CMASF, [Studying the Links between the Most Important Parameters of Socio-Economic, Scientific, Technological and Innovation Development for the Period until 2030], Moscow: Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting; Etzion, O., Niblett, P., (2010) Event Processing in Action, , Cincinnati, OH: Manning Publications; (2009) Europe's Digital Competitiveness Report, , Volume 1: i2010 - Annual Information Society Report 2009 Benchmarking i2010: Trends and Main Achievements European Commission, (COM(2009) 390), Brussels: European Commision; (2010) Facing the Future: Time for the EU to Meet Global Challenges, , European Commission, Seville: IPTS European Commission; (2010) Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.

However, our focus on the future tends to disaggregate food and health into largely separate domains. Indeed, much foresight work is either food systems or health-based with little overlap in terms of predictions or narratives. Work on animal health is no exception. Part of the problem is the fundamental misunderstanding of the role, nature and impact of the modern futures tool kit. Here, I outline three key issues in futures research ranging from methodological confusion over the application of scenarios to the failure to effectively integrate multiple methodologies to the gap between the need for more evidence and power and control over futures processes. At its core, however, a better understanding of the narrative and worldview framing much of the futures work in animal health is required to enhance the value and impact of such exercises.",,"animal; animal husbandry; catering service; food industry; livestock; procedures; trends; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Food Industry; Food Supply; Livestock",,,,,,"Wilkinson, A.",,,,,,,,14752654,,,"23988197","English","Anim Health Res Rev",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897366550

These silicon systems mimic extremely energy efficient neural computing structures, potentially both for solving engineering applications as well as understanding neural computation. Toward this end, the authors provide a glimpse at what the technology evolution roadmap looks like for these systems so that Neuromorphic engineers may gain the same benefit of anticipation and foresight that IC designers gained from Moore's law many years ago. Scaling of energy efficiency, performance, and size will be discussed as well as how the implementation and application space of Neuromorphic systems are expected to evolve over time. © 2013 Hasler and Marr.","FPAA; Neuromorphic engineering; Reconfigurable analog; Simulink","silicon; action potential; article; comparative study; computer; computer analysis; computer language; computer program; cost; dendrite; excitatory postsynaptic potential; human; interpersonal communication; large neuromorphic hardware system; learning algorithm; memory; microprocessor; noise; nonhuman; productivity; pyramidal nerve cell; signal processing; signal transduction; speech discrimination; synapse; systematic review",,"silicon, 7440-21-3",,,"Allman, J., (2000) Evolving Brains, , New York, NY: Scientific American Library; Azevedo, F.A., Carvalho, L.R., Grinberg, L.T., Farfel, J.M., Ferretti, R.E., Leite, R.E., Equal numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells make the human brain an isometrically scaled-up primate brain (2009) J.

The paper describes different classes of empirical models e from small, stylized to large, multisectoral applied models; from static equilibrium models to dynamic, perfect-foresight models e and identifies the characteristics of models best suited to address different policy problems in developing countries. The paper then discusses the different ways CGE models have been and are being used in policy formulation, the types of questions they have addressed, and the lessons learned from past experience. Finally, the paper suggests that, in light of the changing nature of policy making in developing countries, in the future CGE models should be used differently, moving from a purely technocratic exercise used by policy makers to providing an accessible empirical framework that can contribute to a widespread public debate. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

When China’s began preparation for entry into the World Trade Organization, the SOEs found themselves with little time to prepare for outside competition. The long-term influences of traditional centralized systems left companies in a state of redundancies, stagnation and operational obsolescence. Most lack flexibility in terms of structural change, were weak in technological innovation, had a large number of surplus employees, as well as inefficient production and business operations. This paper chronicles the transformation of one of China’s largest leading textile machinery manufacturing companies, Jingwei Textile Machinery Company Ltd. (Jingwei) in its transformation from a relatively inefficient and ineffective SOE to competitive leader in the textile machinery manufacturing industry. In just one year (1998 to 1999), Jingwei realized an astounding 96.2 percent increase in sales. Much of the company’s success is attributed to a commitment to technological advancements and the foresight of top management. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Using the case study of force identification, a concept of the knowledge-based approach is developed. In particular, a toolbox for force reconstruction in Canton Tower is implemented. The case study deepens the insight into identifying needs in the field of SHM to employ knowledge-based approaches, especially in the reasoning process. The proposed concept lays the ground for future research in the field of SHM for utilizing knowledge-based methods in correlation with SHM algorithms and analysis of feedbacks accumulated with/from sensors, engineers or customers. The foresight is to develop a decision-making component for supporting SHM systems, and in turn to foster the detection, localization, classification, assessment and prediction.","Force reconstruction; Integration; Knowledge Based Systems; Reasoning process; SHM","Computer science; Correlation methods; Integration; Research; Structural health monitoring; Force identification; Force reconstruction; Knowledge-based approach; Knowledge-based methods; Predictive maintenance; Reasoning process; SHM; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Knowledge based systems",,,,,"Giurgiutiu, V., (2007) Structural Health Monitoring with Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors, , Elsevier Science & Technology; Balageas, D., Fritzen, C.P., Güemes, A., (2006) Structural Health Monitoring, , London: ISTE Ltd; Worden, K., Dulieu-Barton, J.M., An overview of intelligent fault detection in systems and structures (2004) Structural Health Monitoring, pp. 85-98; Farrar, C.R., Lieven, N.A.J., Bernent, M.T., An introduction to damage prognosis (2005) Damage Prognosis - For Aerospace, Civil and Mechanical Systems, pp. 1-12. , D.

From the 1860s onwards, German economists began to reappraise speculation on differences at stock and commodity exchanges, which had previously been condemned for its likeness to gambling and the morally deficient bourse culture. Maintaining that it is ideal to price information into markets, and applying the classical economists' concept that mercantile foresight perfectly allocates resources over space and time, they declared that exchange speculation served an economic purpose: that of alleviating price fluctuations. The inherent animosity against the exchanges was reframed into exchanges being misused, and this differentiation necessitated a conceptual separation of useful and unwarranted speculation. In rationalizing the persona of the speculator, denying its 'animal spirits', and likening it to the soberly calculating 'honorable merchant', professional speculators (depicted as well-capitalized and intellectually capable) were deemed useful.

While finding an integrated and coherent approach is difficult, the use of strategic foresight might help to fill the gap. This article presents the results of an extensive scenario-building process in which we searched for sustainable solutions regarding food production and consumption in various possible future contexts in Germany. First, so-called context scenarios were formulated to describe different developments beyond the control of the relevant players, but that might have a significant impact on food production and consumption. Second, strategic food scenarios were developed to examine a wide range of sustainable solutions. Finally, the context and strategic food scenarios were merged and assessed to provide policy makers with a helpful ""reality check"" on different strategy options and guidance in prioritization. We explain the underlying methodology and, after a brief discussion of the main advantages and limitations of our approach, we draw some conclusions for sustainable food-consumption policy, highlighting the important role of society. © 2013 Lorenz & Veenhoff.","Food consumption; Public policy; Strategy; Sustainability",,,,,,"Aiken, G., Community transitions to low carbon futures in the Transition Towns Network (TTN) (2012) Geography Compass, 6 (2), pp. 89-99; Alcamo, J., (2001) Scenarios as Tools for International Environmental Assessment, , Environmental Issue Report No. 24.

This study explored the relationship between self and memory when thinking about both past and future events. Participants reported events from the near and distant past and future, for themselves, a close friend, or an acquaintance. Past events were rated higher in phenomenological quality than future events, and near self events were rated higher in quality than those about friends. Although future events were more positive than past events, only valence ratings for self and close friend showed a linear increase in positivity from distant past to future. Content analysis showed that this increase in positivity could not be ascribed to choosing events from the cultural life script. These findings provide evidence for the role of personal goals in imagining the future. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Autobiographical memory; Cultural life script; Episodic foresight; Mental time travel; Self-enhancement","adult; article; autobiographical memory; cultural factor; female; friend; human; major clinical study; male; personal value; qualitative analysis; self concept; thinking",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Pan, L., Vu, M.-A., Laiser, N., Schacter, D.L., Constructive episodic simulation of the future and the past: Distinct subsystems of a core brain network mediate imagining and remembering (2009) Neuropsychologia, 47, pp. 2222-2238; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Arnold, K.M., McDermott, K.B., Szpunar, K.K., Imagining the near and far future: The role of location familiarity (2011) Memory & Cognition, 39, pp. 954-967; Barsalou, L.W., The content and organization of autobiographical memories (1988) Remembering reconsidered: Ecological and traditional approaches to the study of memory, pp. 193-243. , Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, U.

It is written based on documented developments. First a personal story of contribution to Farsi literature and projects is told which also sheds light on the point that in Iran the field is generally driven by a network of too young people. Next inspired by the third culture and based on insights from empirical scientific findings and linguistics nuances the three fold challenge of spreading the futures meme among human populations is discussed. Attributes of global able futurists are introduced too and a discussion follows about their values. Finally in a philosophical and mathematical turn the infinity of human sphere of thought and experience is re-emphasized and the idea of approaching the end of history is severely refuted. An alternative metaphor inspired form the Italian language is suggested also to emphasize the continuous becoming of the human and nonhuman experiences and the need to overcome them. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Foresight; Futures studies; Meme; Planetary; Scenario planning; Science and technology; World Futures Studies Federation","future prospect; language; philosophy; science and technology; Iran",,,,,"Motlagh, V.V., Asia's exotic futures in the far beyond the present (2010) Journal of Futures Studies, 15 (2), pp. 1-16; (1970) Toffler Future Shock, , Random House; (1996) New Thinking for the New Millennium, , Routledge, London, R.A.

The foresight of this choice will make system transplant and software reuse efficient, and help vendors conquer the stress of development cycle and cost. Actually, it is nothing new in aviation and aerospace. However, no literature is proposed to argue the safety issues on a viewpoint of system attribute in train control system but only concentrates the behavior of COTS products themselves. System theory is the key to construct a solid and coherent safety assurance framework for the interaction between COTS sector and other parts, which will explicitly demonstrate the concept of safety on a system level. In this paper, a picture of propagation from bottom functional failures and performance degradation of COTS resource to the top-level hazardous events is depicted to show how safety analysis and risk evaluation of train control system is affected. Additionally, several experiments are carried out to support the argument. © 2013 IEEE.","COTS; fault injection; RTOS; safety analysis; train control system; μC/OS-II","Computer software reusability; Railroads; Safety engineering; COTS; Fault injection; RTOS; Safety analysis; Train control systems; Control systems",,,,,"Pierce, R.H., Preliminary assessment of linux for safety related systems (2002) HSE Contract Research Report RR011/2002, , London; Pierce, R.H., Nicholson, M., Faulkner, A.G., (2005) Assessing Operating System for use in Safety Related Systems: HSE, , London; Halwan, V., Krodel, J., (2002) Study of Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) Real-time Operating Systems (RTOS) in Aviation Applications, , Washington.

For honoring Prof. Huang's 100th birth anniversary this year, we systematically reviewed the developing stages of Prof. Huang's research in global change, and made a comprehensive study on his outstanding academic thoughts as well. His foresight ideas of synthetic, regional and uncertainty research on global change have been confirmed and reflected by research application globally in recent decades. In this paper, we discussed the research direction and keynotes of global change and set up its objective and innovation fields in the future to follow Prof. Huang's grand academic thoughts. This retrospect and prospect would be a framework for the development of integrated physical geography confronting with the new situation of global change, and also be a scientific basis for establishing national-level strategies on global change issues and sustainable development.","Academic thoughts; Global change; Huang Bingwei; Integrated physical geography","academic research; global change; integrated approach; physical geography; research work; Chin; China; Myanmar",,,,,"Huang, B., Progress in physical geographical research (1960) Acta Geographica Sinica, 26 (3), pp. 149-154; Huang, B., Some views of earth surface research (1993) Collections of Huang Binwei's Sixty Years Comprehensive Work of Physical Geography, pp. 25-30. , Editorial Committee of Huang Bingwei Collection.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the major impacts that had fallen on libraries of the world, and the dilemma in particular that Shanghai Library was confronted with in its attempt to optimise the library services. Examples are given with facts and figures to illustrate how the library has been conducting innovation practices to fulfil its paradigm shift. Findings: The paper concludes that today's libraries need fundamental transformation through innovation practices in various aspects and dimensions to keep up with the times. Practical implications: The paper offers practical information and advice to those considering paradigm shift as a strategic organisational imperative. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates how the Shanghai Library has achieved transcendence through transition of its business priority from the paper collection to the various formats that keeps in alliance with the digital and, in further foresight, the omnimedia age. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; E-and-globalised environment; Innovation; Libraries; Paradigm shift; Shanghai Library",,,,,,"Aucamp, L., (2011) Will digital dominate publishing by 2020?, , www.e-relevant.co.za/blog-archive/ebooks/174-will-digital-dominate-publishing-by-2020.html, available at, (accessed 18 March 2012); Berndtson, M., (2011) What and why libraries? - looking at what libraries might look like and why we still need them now, , http://conference.ifla.org/past/ifla77/123-berndtson-en.pdf, paper presented at Public Libraries Section with Metropolitan Libraries, the 77th IFLA General Conference and Assembly, 13-18 August, Puerto Rico, available at: (accessed 3 May 2012); Chen, X.Y., A window open to the whole world: Shanghai Library's global cooperative promotion window of Shanghai (2006) Library Management, 27 (6-7), pp. 321-335; Cohn, L.B., Yahoo! and the abdication of judgment (2001) American Libraries, 32 (1), pp. 60-62; Lancaster, F.W., The evolving paperless society and its implication for libraries (1982) International Forum on Information & Documentation, 7 (4), pp. 3-10; Lane, M., (2003) Idea store: Is this the library of the future?, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2859845.stm, available at: (accessed 10 May 2012); Ledden, S., (2012) The Economics of Anythink, , http://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/features/05012012/economics-anythink, available at: (accessed 10 May 2012); (2004) Review of World's Commerce, , Shanghai Scientific and Technological Literature Publishing House, Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce; (2004) The Developments of Key Service Industries in the World, , Shanghai Scientific and Technological Literature Publishing House, Economic Shanghai Municipal Commission Informatization; (2005) The Developments of Key Manufacturing Industries in the World, , Shanghai Scientific and Technological Literature Publishing House, Economic Shanghai Municipal Commission Informatization; (2011) Communiqué of Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau on Main Figures of the Sixth Population Census of Shanghai, , www.stats-sh.gov.cn/sjfb/201203/239823.html, available at: (accessed 20 August 2012), Bureau Shanghai Municipal Statistics, (in Chinese); (2011) Shanghai Manual: A Guide for Sustainable Urban Development of the Twenty-First Century, , Gezhi Press, Shanghai People's Publishing House, Nations United; (2005) Assessment of the Municipal Libraries on the Island of Montreal, , http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/biblio_fr/media/documents/bibliothequeE.pdf, available at: (accessed 19 August 2012), Montreal Ville de; Wang, S.W., On the establishment of library organization culture suiting and promoting the development of library and information undertakings (2002) Library and Information Work, (5), pp. 87-92; Weeks, L., The old-fangled search engine (2001) Washington Post, (13), pp. c01. , January; Wu, J.Z., Establishing a new knowledge channel: A three-dimensional service model of the Shanghai Library (2004) Library Management, 25 (1-2), pp. 67-71; Wu, J.Z., (2005) The Library of the Twenty-First Century, , Long River, San Francisco, CA; Zhang, H., (2012) The Ninth National Reading Survey Reveals More Online Readership (in Chinese), , www.xinwenren.com/chuban/201204205830.html, available at: (accessed 24 April 2012)","Chen, X.; International Cooperation Division, Shanghai Library, Shanghai, China; email: chenxuyan@libnet.sh.cn",,,,,,,,01435124,,,,"English","Libr.

In this setting, the consumption and saving decisions of city residents are determined jointly with their choice of location, thereby offering an initial step to understanding how housing services influence non-durable consumption, and vice versa. Housing, supplied by profit-maximizing land owners, is distinguished from more non-descript varieties of durable consumption by the attributes and amenities it provides occupants. These attributes are limited in supply, indivisible, and distinguished by their location in geographic space and time of development. In equilibrium, both household consumption and the rental price of housing are expressed in terms of the resident household's permanent income. In contrast to models presuming hand-to-mouth dynamics, dwelling rents depend on interest rates, future realizations of economic fundamentals such as income and commuting costs, and accumulated wealth. Finally, residential saving is determined not only by wealth, income, and market prices, but also by city-specific factors such as population, supply constraints, and the opportunity cost of land, suggesting a novel and important role for regional and geographic differences in consumer behavior. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Housing; Housing rents; Intertemporal consumer choice",,,,,,"Alonso, W., (1964) Location and Land Use, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Anas, A., Dynamics of urban residential growth (1978) Journal of Urban Economics, 10, pp. 53-76; Arnott, R., A simple urban growth model with durable housing (1980) Regional Science and Urban Economics, 10, pp. 53-76; Attanasio, O., Weber, G., Consumption and saving: models of intertemporal allocation and their implications for public policy (2010) Journal of Economic Literature, 23, pp. 693-751; Braid, R., Uniform spatial growth with perfect foresight and durable housing (1988) Journal of Urban Economics, 23, pp. 41-59; Browning, M., Lusardi, A., Household savings: micro theories and micro facts (1996) Journal of Economic Literature, 34, pp. 1855-1979; Brueckner, J., Urban growth models with durable housing: an overview (2000) Economics of Cities: A Theoretical Perspective, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, J.-M.

It is admirable and wonderful that a statesman in London should by acts of intellectual volition have conferred such immense benefits on the far-off countries under his command. The progress achieved was not by way of conquest, the land and people were ours for the taking, and the Secretary of State gave the orders. His predecessors were content to let our talent remain buried; by the policy of Mr. J. Chamberlain we utilized our talent and it grew twenty-fold, nay twenty-five-fold. The revenue of Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate in 1894 was a quarter million pounds; in 1903 it was three-quarter million pounds, or triple. Mr. J. Chamberlain's successors in office have consistently carried on his policy ; and the revenue of Nigeria is now over seven millions sterling. It was his foresight, his judgement, his initiative, and above all his courage in his convictions, which has made small and poor possessions large and wealthy, but his services to West Africa have never been adequately recognized. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

They have pervasive impacts on how and where people can live and what they are likely to be able to do in the future. Policy implementation in these areas suffers from a range of challenges, including how to improve horizon scanning and preparedness, learn from past policy experiences, deal with policy interdependencies, and develop forms of more citizen-centric policy. When these challenges are responded to effectively, it can lead to enhanced foresight and planning, better understanding and communication of policy complexity, and communication of uncertainty and ambiguity, that are key to effective policy implementation. In this context, this paper presents and analyses a number of practical responses to water and climate policy implementation challenges, including the development of ""low regret"" policy and infrastructure options that encourage flexibility in responding to possible futures. It also highlights the important role that collaboratively acting now across sectors, issues, governance levels and groups of stakeholders to plan for a range of future scenarios can have on enhancing the capacity of all involved and building pathways to more sustainable and resilient futures. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Climate change; Collaboration; Planning; Preparedness; Public policy; Resilience; Risk management; Science-policy interface; Security; Variability; Water management",,,,,,"Alexandra, J., Donaldson, J., Climate change and water-knowledge, scarcity and innovation (2012) Water and Climate: Policy Implementation Challenges: Proceedings of the 2ndPractical Responses to Climate Change Conference, pp. 494-501. , Daniell, K.A.

The proposed framework is validated with respondents from Nantou County, which is located in Taiwan. The findings show that a good overall fit of the proposed model with the empirical data. This study also demonstrates that perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers have jointly significantly positive effect on cues to action. Furthermore, both cues to action and self efficacy have significantly positive effect on usage intention. This study emphasizes that hospital managers should pay more attention to understanding the five concepts of health belief of elderly (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers and cues to action), and improving self efficacy of elderly. The findings also imply that a successful telehealth system is not only an information system but also a health service provider to the residents. The findings may be used as a theoretical basis for future research and can also offer empirical foresight to the executives and managers of hospitals when they initially introduce and promote the telehealth systems into their surrounding community. © 2013 Kavala Institute of Technology.","Health belief model; Self efficacy; Telecare; Telehealth","Managers; Medical computing; Health belief model; Hospital managers; Perceived benefits; Perceived susceptibility; Self efficacy; Telecare; Telehealth; Telehealth system; Health",,,,,"Rosenstock, I.M., Historical origins of the health belief model (1974) Health Education Monographs, 2 (4), pp. 328-335; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84 (2), pp. 191-215; Dewsbury, G., (2010) Defining telecare?', , http://www.gdewsbury.ukideas.com/telecaredefined.html, Retrieved from April 5; Department of Health of Executive Yuan (2010) A pilot project of telecare in Taiwan, , http://doh.telecare.com.tw/, Retrieved from April 4; Lee, C.Y., Huang, E.W., Chiou, S.F., Yang, R.J., Chao, P.J., Hung, R.S., Lin, Y.T., Design and development of a new community healthcare management model by using telehealth service system (2009) The Journal of Taiwan Association for Medical Informatics, 18 (1), pp. 39-53; Brownsell, S., Blackburn, S., Hawley, M.S., An evaluation of second and third generation telecare services in older people's housing (2008) Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, 14 (1), pp. 8-12; Moffatt, J.J., Eley, D.S., The reported benefits of telehealth for rural Australians (2010) Australian Health Review, 34, pp. 276-281; Hendy, J., Barlow, J., The adoption of telecare in the community (2012) Community Practitioner, 85 (3), pp. 41-43; Miller, T.W., Miller, J.M., Kraus, R.F., Kaak, O., Sprang, R., Veltkamp, L.J., Telehealth: A clinical application model for rural consultation (2003) Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research, 55 (2), pp. 119-127; Wade, R., Cartwright, C., Shaw, K., Factors relating to home telehealth acceptance and usage compliance (2012) Risk Management and Healthcare Policy, 5, pp. 25-33; Jayanti, R.K., Burns, A.C., The antecedents of preventive health care behavior: An empirical study Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 26 (1), pp. 6-15; Poss, J.E., Developing a new model for cross-cultural research: Synthesizing the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Reasoned Action Advances in Nursing Science, 23 (4), pp. 1-15; Rosenstock, I.M., Strecher, V.J., Becker, M.H., Social learning theory and the Health Belief Model (1988) Health Education Quarterly, 15 (2), pp. 175-183; Jayanti, R.K., Burns, A.C., The antecedents of preventive health care behavior: An Empirical Study (1998) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 26 (1), pp. 6-15; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Hair, J.F., Anderson, R.E., Tatham, R.L., Black, W.C., (1998) Multivariate Data Analysis, NJ: Prentice Hall; Nunnally, J.C., (1978) Psychometric Theory, 2nd Ed, , New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Fornell, C., Larcker, D.F., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error (1981) Journal of Marketing Research, 18, pp. 39-50","Tsai, C.H.; Department of Health Administration, Tzu Chi College of Technology, Hualien, Taiwan; email: tsairob@tccn.edu.tw",,,"Technological Education Institute of Kavala",,,,,17919320,,,,"English","J.

Measuring development has been a matter of debate for nearly half a century. The conventional way of assessing development by social and economic indicators only has been challenged many times during this period. Accelerated urbanization in developing countries and the concentration of activities and population in some regions, have led to regional imbalances. This is one of the important characteristics of the third world countries. This characteristics is affected by pole growth policies that have led to a concentration of facilities in one or more of several regions. In this case, regional planning science offers beneficial patterns to resolve problems. The first step is the identification of socio-economical disparities in these regions. However, this article attempts to survey development disparities in the East Azarbaijan province. In this survey 44 indicators were selected for the comparison of the counties, and the Numeric Taxonomic & Cluster Analysis methods were used to rank the regions. Finally this article presents priority of counties for investment in order to achieve social justice. According to the results of this research the west area of the province is prosperous and east area has a low degree of development. © 2013 Journal of Urban and Environmental Engineering (JUEE).","Development ranking; East Azarbaijan; Foresight; Regional disparities",,,,,,"Amini, N., Ranking health in Iran province (2006) Refah J, 5 (1), pp. 27-48; Antonescu, D., Identifying regional disparities in Romania: A convergence process perspective in relation to European Unions territorial structure (2012) Proc.

Despite this evidence, timing deficits in ADHD are still somewhat neglected in the literature and mostly omitted from reviews on ADHD. There is therefore a lack of integrative reviews on the up-to-date evidence on neurocognitive and neurofunctional deficits of timing in ADHD and their significance with respect to other behavioural and cognitive deficits. The present review provides a synthetic overview of the evidence for neurocognitive and neurofunctional deficits in ADHD in timing functions, and integrates this evidence with the cognitive neuroscience literature of the neural substrates of timing. The review demonstrates that ADHD patients are consistently impaired in three major timing domains, in motor timing, perceptual timing and temporal foresight, comprising several timeframes spanning milliseconds, seconds, minutes and longer intervals up to years. The most consistent impairments in ADHD are found in sensorimotor synchronisation, duration discrimination, reproduction and delay discounting. These neurocognitive findings of timing deficits in ADHD are furthermore supported by functional neuroimaging studies that show dysfunctions in the key inferior fronto-striato-cerebellar and fronto-parietal networks that mediate the timing functions. Although there is evidence that these timing functions are inter-correlated with other executive functions that are well established to be impaired in the disorder, in particular working memory, attention, and to a lesser degree inhibitory control, the key timing deficits appear to survive when these functions are controlled for, suggesting independent cognitive deficits in the temporal domain. There is furthermore strong evidence for an association between timing deficits and behavioural measures of impulsiveness and inattention, suggesting that timing problems are key to the clinical behavioural profile of ADHD. Emerging evidence shows that the most common treatment of ADHD with the dopamine agonist and psychostimulant Methylphenidate attenuates most timing deficits in ADHD and normalises the abnormally blunted recruitment of the underlying fronto-striato-cerebellar networks. Timing function deficits in ADHD, therefore, next to executive function deficits, form an independent impairment domain, and should receive more attention in neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and pharmacological basic research as well as in translational research aimed to develop pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment of abnormal timing behaviour and cognition in ADHD. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","ADHD;

The existence of both institutes was to a great extent facilitated by the foresight of Prof. Pisin Chen, current director of LeCosPA, and we fully envision the vibrant on-going collaboration between the two institutes for the years to come. This presentation highlights the current research direction of KIPAC, including the wide range of programs in particle astrophysics and cosmology. Of the on-going projects, the main current effort at KIPAC is the operation of, and the analysis of data from the Large Area Telescope on-board the space-borne Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which is described in more detail in the article by Prof. Kamae in these proceedings. That article focuses on the instrument, and the results gleaned from observations of our own Galaxy. Here, the second part of this article also includes the highlights for astrophysics of jets emanating from the vicinity of black holes, which are prominent gamma-ray sources detected by Fermi: this is the area of research of the article's author. © 2013 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

These requirements include: (1) the creation of a group of experts who can provide the necessary level of expertise concerning key issues related to the development of the subject area (2) accumulation of a sufficient background information (3) establishing an adequate sequence of Foresight methods, integrating those that are more of creative, interactive, expert-and evidence-based methods (4) Integrating consideration of both market-pull and technology-push approaches, and (5) recognising the different kinds of effects that may be associated with implementing various new technologies. We illustrate this with the case of wastewater treatment. Roadmapping allows for the elaboration of comprehensive innovation strategies, both for short-run time frames (focusing on the commercialization of products with high market readiness), and for longer-term strategies for water sector development. The methodology allows for examining both the direct and indirect effects of the implementation of emerging technologies in the area studied, and makes it possible to outline possible future developments of the technologies considered in related sectors. The main limitation of the method as currently used may be that it is difficult to give sufficient consideration to the indirect effects of using innovative technologies, when we are dealing with fields that feature many interfaces across the economy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Ahuja, G., Coff, R.W., Lee, P.M., Managerial Foresight and attempted rent appropriation: Insider trading on knowledge of imminent breakthroughs (2005) Strateg Manage, J 26 (9), pp. 791-808; Albright, R., Kappel, T., Roadmapping the corporation (2003) IEEE Engineering Management Review, 31 (3), pp. 32-41; Arnold, M., Koivunen, K., Mroueh, U.-M., Paulsrud, B., Rusten, B., NOWATECH -Innovative Nordic Water Technologies (2008) Technology Review.

This scenario was even sharper before the emergence of theory of evolution in biology as an ontological essence was attached strongly to Man's existence. However, the Darwinian natural selection is pivotal in successfully unearthing the common descent among all species; proves the growth of simplicity into complexity; can explain the trait of altruism; all of which are through the natural selection criterion of being callous, purposeless, unintelligent, and without foresight. Owing to evolutionary thinking in biology, it has become feasible to recognize the evolution of everything but it remains a challenge to devise a generalized theory of evolution transparent across all disciplines. This paper has the aim of meeting the challenge by recognizing the existence of the above timescales and using a modified concept of feedback loops of systems science/cybernetics. The outcome is evolutionary systemics, which is a generalized theory of evolution applicable to every human endeavor. The applications include philosophy and science as a whole, all driven by evolutionary transitions. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this system, each probe-vehicle that is assigned a detour based on anticipatory stigmergy requests another probe-vehicle that is assigned a route based on the conventional approach to change route assignment. Anticipatory stigmergy collects near-future traffic positions of probe-vehicles. Recently, advances in Intelligent Transport Systems suggest a future in which vehicles will handle their own positions. Our foresight-route-providing method combines a previous method that utilized the past travel times of vehicles for decentralized traffic congestion management. We assume that all vehicles collect dynamic traffic conditions in decentralized processing environments as real implementation environments during the simulations and negotiate among vehicles based on a rational probe vehicle. In this paper, we demonstrate that an automated negotiation system has the potential for significant efficiency and stability for traffic flow in decentralized processing environments that can collect dynamic traffic conditions from the previous few minutes and estimate the vehicle positions after a few minutes in only limited area. We confirm that an automated negotiation system for changing route assignment contributes to the efficiency of traffic flow and time loss in congestion of each probe vehicle. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Automation; Motor transportation; Probes; Traffic surveys; Vehicles; Automated negotiations; Congestion management; Conventional approach; Dynamic traffic conditions; Intelligent transport systems; Negotiation systems; Processing environments; Vehicle position; Traffic congestion",,,,,"Maruyama, T., Incorporation trip chaining behavior in network equilibrium analysis (2004) Infrastructure Planning Review, 29; Ito, T., Kanamori, R., Chakraborty, S., Otsuka, T., Hara, K., A survery of multi-agents research that supports future societal systems(1) - Economic paradigm, negotiating agents, and transportation management (2013) Journal of JSAI, 28 (3), pp. 360-367; Gaku Yamamoto, H.T., Mizuta, H., Performance evaluation of a traffic simulator based on massive agent based simulation (2007) Joint Agent Workshops and Symposium 2007(JAWS2007); Vehicle Information and Communication System, , VICS; Mase, K., Inter-vehicle communications and mobile ad hoc networks) (2006) The IEICE Transactions on Communications, , (JAPANESE EDITION) B, COMMUNICATIONS; Dorigo, M., Gambardella, L.M., Ant colony system: A cooperative learning approach to the traveling salesman problem (1997) IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation; Chen, B., Cheng, H.H., A review of the applications of agent technology in traffic and transportation systems (2010) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Dorigo, M., Stutzle, T., (2010) Ant Colony Optimization: Overview and Recent Advances, , Springer; Claes, R., Holvoet, T., Weyns, D., A decentralized approach for anticipatory vehicle routing using delegate multiagent systems (2011) Intelligent Transportation Systems, , IEEE Transactions on; Dallmeyer, J., Schumann, R., Lattner, A.D., Timm, I.J., Don't go with the ant flow: Ant-inspired traffic routing in urban environments (2012) The Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Agents in Traffic and Transportation (ATT2012); De Weerdt, M.M., Gerding, E., Stein, S., Robu, V., Jennings, N.R., Intention-aware routing to minimise delays at electric vehicle charging stations (2013) Proc. 23rd Int.

Thus far, many underlying conditions or environmental factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking or obesity, as well as a family history of coronary artery diseases have been identified as risks for the onset of AMI. These risks suggest that AMI occurs due to interactions between underlying conditions and multiple genetic susceptibilities. For this reason, many target gene-disease association studies have been performed with the recent introduction of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have further revealed new genetic susceptibilities for AMI. GWAS is a way to examine many common genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait in a case-control fashion, and typically focuses on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and traits. SNP on chromosome 9p21 is one of the robust susceptibility variants for AMI which has been identified by many GWAS. In this review, we overview the methodology of GWAS, introduce genetic variants identified by GWAS as those with susceptibility for AMI, and describe the foresight of using GWAS to investigate genetic susceptibility to AMI.",,"Asian; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genetics; heart infarction; human; methodology; review; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors",,,,,,"Hara, M.",,,,,,,,00471860,,,"23672096","Japanese","Rinsho Byori",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882673645

This study examines an ethic of care approach to crisis management analysing the case of Northern Rock bank which was at the centre of the recent financial crisis in the UK. The development and maintenance of relationships is fundamental to an ethic of care approach and the research recognises this by examining the bank-stakeholder relationship both before and after the crisis. Considerable anger was directed at the bank post-crisis and, subsequently, the management team resigned. An important contention is that because an ethic of care approach had not been followed external parties judged that management should have foreseen the crisis and the harm caused was deemed intentional, even though predicting the crisis would have been difficult and it is improbable any harm was intended. Additionally, this negative reaction was heightened due to three facets of Northern Rock's history: (i) its previous existence as a building society, (ii) the 'local' nature of the bank and (iii) the creation of The Northern Rock Foundation. These historical factors caused local stakeholders to presume a 'caring' relationship between themselves, and the bank had continued to exist post-demutualisation. The events of the crisis compelled stakeholders to re-appraise this presumption, amplifying the post-crisis anger. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bank; Crisis; Crisis management; Ethic of care; Foresight; Intention",,,,,,"Bauman, D.C., Evaluating ethical approaches to crisis leadership: Insights from unintentional harm research (2011) Journal of Business Ethics, 98, pp. 281-295; Boyd, D.P., Art and artifice in public apologies (2011) Journal of Business Ethics, 104 (3), pp. 299-309; Choi, T.H., Jung, J., Ethical commitment, financial performance, and valuation: An empirical investigation of Korean companies (2007) Journal of Business Ethics, 81, pp. 447-463; Clarkson, M.B.E., A stakeholder framework for analysing and evaluating corporate social performance (1995) Academy of Management Review, 20 (1), pp. 92-117; Cole, E., Coultrap-McQuin, S., (1992) Explorations in Feminist Ethics, , Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press; Collins, J., Porras, J., (1994) Built to Last, , New York: Harper Business; Cook, J., Deakin, S., Hughes, A., Mutuality and corporate governance: the evolution of building societies following deregulation (2002) Journal of Corporate Law Studies, 2 (1), pp. 110-138; Donaldson, T., Preston, L., The stakeholder theory of the corporation: Concepts, evidence and implications (1995) Academy of Management Review, 20 (1), pp. 65-91; Fassin, Y., Gosselin, D., The collapse of a European bank in the financial crisis: an analysis from stakeholder and ethical perspectives (2011) Journal of Business Ethics, 102 (2), pp. 169-191; Freeman, R.E., (1994) Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach, , Boston: Pitman; www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication, FSA Press Notices.

This SHM system can monitor debonding in interface between a skin panel and stringer flange by analysis of a Lamb wave which is a type of ultrasonic wave. Namely, this system is suitable to detect fatal damages for an aircraft structure in ""Hot-Spot"". Development of this system will make it possible to reduce maintenance costs on airlines, to improve safety and reliability of aircraft, and in future, to achieve innovative aircraft structure which is lighter than present aircraft. We are conducting research and development with Airbus and SOKEIZAI center for practical applications of the SHM system for the near future.

This has been partly attributed to increasing natural hazard effects caused by global warming and land use changes (in particular deforestation). This chapter provides an overview of risk-relevant issues and an evaluation of the role of carbon(C)-rich ecosystems within the overall context of natural disaster risk. Hazard mitigation ecosystem services which are discussed include the regulation of global, regional and local climates (via C storage, evapo-transpiration, and albedo); the provision of structural stability to soil substrates (reducing risks of shallow landslides, and erosion during fl ooding); retention and transpiration of water (reducing flooding frequencies and intensities in catchments); and the buffering against solid and fluid mass impacts (landslides, rockfalls, snow avalanches, wind-driven sea waves, storm surges, and tsunamis). The information provided may serve to advance the valuation of ecosystems and support development-relevant decision-making, especially in regions prone to natural disasters. It is highlighted that heedless destruction of ecosystems will come at an increasingly higher cost to current and future generations, with progressively fewer options to maintain or reinstate their services. Hence, sensible foresight stipulates a precautionary approach when dealing with the remaining ‘ecosystem capital’. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Climate change; Ecosystem valuation; Floods; Landslides; Natural disaster risk; Vulnerability; Wave hazards","Avalanches (snowslides); Climate change; Deforestation; Disasters; Ecology; Floods; Global warming; Hazards; Landslides; Losses; Rock bursts; Stability; Transpiration; Ecosystem services; Future generations; Hazard mitigations; Natural disaster risk; Natural disasters; Precautionary approach; Structural stabilities; Vulnerability; Ecosystems",,,,,"Abiven, S., Menasseri, S., Chenu, C., The effects of organic inputs over time on aggregate stability - a literature analysis (2009) Soil Biol Biochem, 41, pp. 1-12; Ackermann-Liebrich, U.A., Braun, C., Rapp, R.C., Epidemiologic analysis of an environmental disaster: The Schweizerhalle experience (1992) Environ Res, 58, pp. 1-14; Adger, W.N., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Carpenter, S.R., Rockstrom, J., Social-ecological resilience to coastal disasters (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1036-1039; Aksornkoae, S., Tokrishna, R., (2003) Overview of Shrimp Farming and Mangrove Loss in Thailand, , Barbier EB, Sathirathai S (eds) Shrimp farming and mangrove loss in Thailand.

Dissecting different aspects of impulsive behaviour and relating these to specific neurobiological circuits would improve our understanding of the etiology of complex behaviours for which impulsivity is key, and advance genetic studies in this behavioural domain. In this review, we will discuss the heritability of some impulsivity constructs and their possible use as endophenotypes (heritable, disease-associated intermediate phenotypes). Several functional genetic variants associated with impulsive behaviour have been identified by the candidate gene approach and resequencing, and whole genome strategies can be implemented for discovery of novel rare and common alleles influencing impulsivity. Via deep sequencing an uncommon HTR2B stop codon, common in one population, was discovered, with implications for understanding impulsive behaviour in both humans and rodents and for future gene discovery. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This study used a multi-dimensional model of impulsivity to examine this construct in participants with hoarding (n=32) and anxiety disorders (n=32) who received a diagnostic assessment and completed self-report forms and neuropsychological tasks measuring impulsivity. A diagnosis of hoarding predicted higher levels of self-reported urgency, as well as greater difficulties with response inhibition and lowered adaptive and maladaptive risk taking, independent of social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. However, when age was controlled, hoarding ceased to predict these outcomes independent of other psychiatric diagnoses. Although specific symptoms of hoarding appeared significantly related to some aspects of impulsivity, analyses indicated that age accounted for these findings. In the present study, as in other studies, hoarding participants averaged approximately 25 years older than those with anxiety disorders, rendering examination of response inhibition and risk taking in hoarding versus anxiety disorders more difficult. Further research on other aspects of impulsivity (e.g., reward delay, planning/foresight) in hoarding and other psychiatric conditions with age matched comparison samples can advance understanding of these disorders and potentially lead to innovative treatments. © 2013.","Acquisition; Hoarding; Impulsivity","adult; aged; agoraphobia; anxiety disorder; article; daily life activity; DSM-IV; female; generalized anxiety disorder; high risk behavior; human; impulsiveness; major clinical study; major depression; male; neuropsychological test; obsessive hoarding; panic; priority journal; psychometry; questionnaire; rating scale; self report; semi structured interview; social phobia",,,,,"Abramowitz, J.S., Franklin, M.E., Schwartz, S.A., Furr, J.M., Symptom presentation and outcome of cognitive-behavioral therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (2003) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 71, pp. 1049-1057; Abramowitz, J.S., Wheaton, M.G., Storch, E.A., The status of hoarding as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (2008) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 46, pp. 1026-1033; Aron, A.R., Poldrack, R.A., The cognitive neuroscience of response inhibition: Relevance for genetic research in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2005) Biological Psychiatry, 57, pp. 1285-1292; Ayers, C.R., Wetherell, J.L., Golshan, S., Saxena, S., Cognitive-behavioral therapy for geriatric compulsive hoarding (2011) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 49, pp. 689-694; Barratt, E.S., Anxiety and impulsiveness related to psychomotor efficiency (1959) Perceptual and Motor Skills, 9, pp. 191-198; Bayard, S., Raffard, S., Gely-Nareot, M.C., Do facets of self-reported impulsivity predict decision-making under ambiguity and risk?

A first composite good may be used for consumption or investment on a one-to-one basis, while a second good is only used for accumulation, solely capital inputs being part of the production process. This framework is first considered from the allocative standpoint through the derivation of the frontier of the production possibility set. Having defined the perfect foresight competitive equilibrium that also describes a Pareto optimum over time, attention is then given to the potential for unbounded steady growth solutions. Under interiority, summability, and expansivity restrictions, there is a unique optimal steady growth rate. For unitary depreciation rates of both capital goods, locally there exists a unique convergent sequence to this steady growth solution that exhibits a saddlepoint structure. However, as soon as one of the depreciation rates of the capital goods is non-unitary and the profit share accruing to the first capital stock is greater in the second pure accumulation industry than in the first composite good industry, the steady growth solution shows a loss of stability, and competitive equilibrium growth cycles emerge through the occurrence of a flip bifurcation in its neighborhood. This is the first optimal cycles result based upon a production set that does not explicitly incorporate any exogenously determined primary labor input in its definition. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Optimal cycles; Production possibility frontier; Unbounded steady growth",,,,,,"Baierl, G., Nishimura, K., Yano, M., The role of capital depreciation in multi-sectoral model (1998) J Econ Behav Organ, 33, pp. 467-479; Benhabib, J., Nishimura, K., Competitive equilibrium cycles (1985) J Econ Theory, 35, pp. 284-306; Benhabib, J., Nishimura, K., Venditti, A., Indeterminacy and cycles in two-sector discrete time model (2002) Econ Theory, 20, pp. 217-235; Bond, E., Wang, P., Yip, C., A general two-sector model of endogenous growth with human and physical capital: balanced growth and transitional dynamics (1996) J Econ Theory, 68, pp. 149-173; D'Autume, A., Michel, P., (1992) Les théories de la croissance endogène.

He was the only Chinese in history to have single-handedly founded a private university in Amoy and financially maintained it for sixteen years. He was the only Hua-ch'iao of his generation to have led the Chinese in South-East Asia to help China to resist the Japanese invasion in a concerted and coordinated manner. Moreover, he was the only Hua-ch'iao leader to have played both Singapore and China politics and affairs in close quarters, rubbing shoulders with British governors, Chinese officials and commanders. Finally, it is important to point out that Tan Kah-kee was the only Hua-ch'iao in his times to have combined his Pang, community and political power and influences for the advancement of community, regional and national goals. This is an in-depth study of not just Tan Kah-kee per se but also the making of a legend through his deeds, self-sacrifices, fortitude and foresight. This revised edition sheds new light on his political agonies in Mao's China over campaigns against capitalists and intellectuals. Moreover, it analyses more comprehensively the varied legacies of Tan Kah-kee, including his successors, the style of his non-partisan political leadership, his educational strategy for nation-building, social change and “the Spirit of Tan Kah-kee”, currently in vogue in his home province, Fukien. © 2014 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The purpose of this paper is to propose an innovative methodology for social research, that is, chiasmatic interpretative communities (CIC). Design/methodology/approach: The importance of evidence-based research to inform future social policy and practice depends on trustworthy information and the chosen research design or methodology must fit the purpose. The strengths and limitations of the focus group method are critically evaluated. Potential issues of accuracy during analysis are resolved by informing the interpretation of the discourse with experts from the community. Findings: Chiasmatic interpretative communities offer a re-imagined synthesis of a repeated focus group approach, with community experts as interpreters. Research limitations/implications: This blurs two methodological boundaries to enhance academic rigor. They are, the temporal blurring of linear sequential phases in research design (data collection and then data analysis) and the spatial blurring of power relations within the researcher:participant dyad. Practical implications: This transformative methodology is described from a pragmatist standpoint within an evaluative framework. Social implications: This innovative methodology potentially provides an emic perspective to inform social policy decisions. It aims to bring participants into the research process that might shape their future social services. Originality/value: A final section discusses the foresight of CIC and describes the bricolage of this critical qualitative research methodology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bricolage; Chiasmatic interpretative communities; Focus groups; Interpretative community; Qualitative research; Qualitative social research; Repeated focus groups; Sociology",,,,,,"Allen, L., Managing masculinity: Young men's identity work in focus groups (2005) Qualitative Research, 5 (1), pp. 35-57; Aluwihare-Samaranayake, M., Ethics in qualitative research: A view of the participants' and researchers' world from a critical standpoint (2012) International Journal of Qualitative Methods, 11 (2), pp. 64-81; Anchin, J., Special section: The critical role of the dialectic in viable metatheory (2008) Theory and Psychology, 18 (6), pp. 801-816; Baert, P., Towards a pragmatist-inspired philosophy of social science (2005) Acta Sociologica, 48 (3), pp. 191-203; Barbour, R.S., Checklists for improving rigor in qualitative research: A case for the tail wagging the dog?

Foresight studies on food security are frequently based on crop yield trends estimated from yield time series provided by national and regional statistical agencies. Various types of statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of yield time series, but the predictive performances of these models have not yet been evaluated in detail. In this study, we present eight statistical models for analyzing yield time series and compare their ability to predict wheat yield at the national and regional scales, using data provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and by the French Ministry of Agriculture. The Holt-Winters and dynamic linear models performed equally well, giving the most accurate predictions of wheat yield. However, dynamic linear models have two advantages over Holt-Winters models: they can be used to reconstruct past yield trends retrospectively and to analyze uncertainty. The results obtained with dynamic linear models indicated a stagnation of wheat yields in many countries, but the estimated rate of increase of wheat yield remained above 0.06 t ha -1 year -1 in several countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and America, and the estimated values were highly uncertain for several major wheat producing countries. The rate of yield increase differed considerably between French regions, suggesting that efforts to identify the main causes of yield stagnation should focus on a subnational scale.",,"article; comparative study; geography; growth, development and aging; statistical model; time; wheat; Geography; Models, Statistical; Time Factors; Triticum",,,,,,"Michel, L.",,,,,,,,19326203,,,"24205280","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898880803

Future-oriented Technology analysis are concerned with complex dynamic systems and processes and engage multiple stakeholders in participatory and interdisciplinary processes to assure distributed understanding and sustainable development. Thus, there are variety of methods, and variety of possible classification criteria and the combined use of this extensive variety of methods in this research processes, and in which there are some important foresight methods such as 'Scenario building', 'Delphi' and 'Roadmapping'. As one of important FTA methods, the practice of technology roadmapping (TRM) has received much attention from researchers and practitioners, to support planning and forecasting in companies and sectors. However, little research has focused on the intelligence analysis of the text content of TRM but a lot of research has focused on the optimization of TRM methods. The paper proposes a triple co-occurrence algorithm to build the future-oriented technology analysis thesaurus of technology roadmap based on text mining combining the method of scientometrics and natural language processing, which reveals the future-oriented technology development direction and level characteristics of special technical field and achieves preliminarily the target of future-oriented technology analysis of technology roadmap. The experiment shows that this method can support the FTA of technology roadmap to some extent. © 2013 IEEE.","Future-oriented Technology Analysis; Technology Roadmap; Text Mining; Triple Co-occurrence","Fuzzy systems; Industrial management; Natural language processing systems; Research; Technological forecasting; Technology; Classification criterion; Co-occurrence; Complex dynamic systems; NAtural language processing; Technology analysis; Technology development; Technology roadmaps; Text mining; Data mining",,,,,"Porter, A.L., Technology futures analysis: Toward integration of the field and new methods (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71, pp. 287-303; Cahnin, C., Keenan, M., Johnston, R., (2008) Future-Oriented Technology Analysis, , Springer; Kreibich, R., Oertel, B., Futures studies and future-oriented technology analysis principles (2013) Methodology and Research Questions, , http://berlinsymposium.org/sites/berlinsymposium.org/files/ foresight_final_draft_formatted_sfr_111015_2.pdf, April; Porter, A., (2013) Technology Futures Analyses: New Method, , http://www.cgee.org.br/arquivos/ib02.pdf, April; Yoon, B., Phaal, R., Probert, D., Morphology analysis for technology roadmapping: Application of text mining (2008) R&D Management, 38, pp. 51-68. , 1 st ed; Lee, S., Lee, S., Seol, H., (2008) Using Patent Information for Designing New Product and Technology: Keyword Based Technology Roadmapping, 38, pp. 169-188. , 2 nd ed; Lan, L., Xinli, Z., Yan, L., The discovery of technology innovation opportunity based on the text mining and the technology roadmap (2007) China Soft Science, pp. 102-110. , 6 th; Feng, X., Fuhai, L., Concepts, methods and development of future-oriented technology analysis (2010) Journal of the China Society for Scientific and Technical Information, 29, pp. 539-544. , 3 rd ed; Feng, X., Research on modified method of patent technology morphyology analysis (2010) The Chinese Academy of Sciences of Beijing; Lin, W., Research on key issues in morphology association analysis (2012) Chinese Academy of Sciences of Beijing; Fuhai, L., Lin, W., Lixue, W., Key issues in morphology analysis based on text mining (2012) Library and Information Service, 56, pp. 27-30. , 4 th ed; Yunqiu, Z., Improvement on the methods of disjoint literature-based knowledge discovery (2008) Chinese Academy of Sciences of Beijing; Xiwen, L., Chunxiao, K., The applications of technology roadmap and its enlightenmeng to strategic intellligence research (2007) Library and Information Service, 51, pp. 37-41. , 6 th ed; Chunlei, Y., Fuhai, L., Study on the keyword extraction from roadmap based on the lexical chains (2013) New Technology of Library and Information Service, 29, pp. 57-62. , 1 st ed; Meador, M.A., Files, B., Li, J., Draft nanotechnology roadmap: Technology area 10 (2010) National Aeronautics and Space Administration",,,"","IEEE Computer Society","2013 10th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2013","23 July 2013 through 25 July 2013","Shenyang",105430,,9781467352536,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

[2007] and to present a comparison of nanotechnology acceptance in Turkey and Switzerland. The participants in our survey acknowledge the benefits of nanotechnology in achieving a preferred future (significance on the country's economy and on wealth creation, as well as quality of life) while reserving some sceptism on the institutions' responsibility in utilizing nanotechnology in the food domain. The most beneficial application in our study is viewed as nanotechnology-used bread compared to food packaging of Swiss study. The most risky application is seen as the application for tomatoes, the most affect is observed again for the tomatoes and willingness to buy (WTB) choice is more for juice application than any other applications analyzed in this study. Perceived benefits and perceived risks are found to have influence on the WTB nanotechnology applications in the food domain. Results did not support any evidence suggesting that the nanoinside applications are perceived as less acceptable than nanooutside application as stated in the Swiss study. Affect evoked by the information existing in environment about the nanotechnology products have significant relation with benefits and risks of this emerging technology. The relation between affect and risk in our model is positive whereas it is negative in Siegrist et al. [2007]. The effect of social trust on affect is found to be insignificant in our study which was an assumption of Siegrist et al. [2007] and found to be significant in their research. This paper attempts to help the managers to understand the youth and young adults' perception of nanotechnology in Turkey and to consider the importance of those perceptions for the realization of technological advances in improving their products and developing new ones. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Nanotechnology; Switzerland; Turkey; Youth foresight",,,,,,"Bak, H., Education and public attitudes toward science: Implications for the ""deficit model"" of education and support for science and technology (2001) Social Sciences Quarterly, 82 (4), pp. 779-793; Besley, J.C., Kramer, V.L., Priest, S.H., Expert opinion on nanotechnology: Risks, benefits and regulation (2008) Journal of Nanoparticle Research, 10, pp. 549-558; Cobb, M.D., Macoubrie, J., Public perceptions about nanotechnology: Risks, benefits, and trust (2004) Journal of Nanoparticle Research, 6, pp. 395-405; Cox, D.N., Evans, G., Construction and validation of a psychometric scale to measure consumers' fears of novel food technologies: The food technology neophobia scale (2008) Food Quality and Preference, 19, pp. 704-710; Dainelli, D., Gontard, N., Spyropoulos, D., Beuken, E.Z., Tobback, P., Active and intelligent food packaging: Legal aspects and safety concerns (2008) Trends in Food Science & Technology, 19, pp. S103-S112; De Azeredo, H.M.C., Nanocomposites for food packaging applications (2009) Food Research International, 42, pp. 1240-1253; Dreyer, M., Renn, O., Cope, S., Frewer, L.J., Including social impact assessment in food safety governance (2009) Food Control, , doi: 10.1016/j.foodcont.2009.05.007; Finucane, M.L., Alhakami, A.S., Slovic, P., Johnson, S.M., The affect heuristic in judgments of risks and benefits (2000) Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 13, pp. 1-17; Fischer, A.R.H., Frewer, L.J., Consumer familiarity with foods and the perception of risks and benefits (2009) Food Quality and Preference, 20, pp. 576-585; Hailu, G., Boecker, A., Henson, S., Cranfield, J., Consumer valuation of functional foods and nutraceuticals in Canada.

Still there is no insight into, or foresight of, modeling complexity as a whole. This paper formulates a vision for modeling complexity using evolutionary systemics, which integrates evolutionary and systemic thinking. This paper recognizes cognitive model thinking of the individuals assisted by their instincts; communal model thinking due to cohesion of individual mindsets; and institutional modeling practices capable of evolutionary transitions. The following transitions are identified: (i) primitive modeling, prevailed until the 17th century; (ii) prototype modeling until 1950, which started afresh by unselecting its past primitive modeling practices; and (iii) computational modeling since 1950, which largely reinvented past capabilities under the computational environments. Over the years since 1950, modeling complexity has seemingly been growing organically but whilst this signifies healthy growth, it underlines potential problems. The practice-data is used to analyze this complexity by applying evolutionary systemics. This helps referencing a vision of modeling complexity to the full evolutionary contexts and identifying relevant issues. In this way, the paper shows that modeling complexity is infested with increasing complexity and increasing dynamism. The emerging complex systems suffer from a new kind of entropy retarding growth. The paper also studies the structure of complexity exploring the feasibility of deriving a cladistics for modeling complexity. This is a radical departure from conventional thinking, as new investments on model developments can avoid bottlenecks. The gained insight invokes the need for rethinking and making a research case for the formation of the science of modeling . © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, the understanding of the physical science basis of geoengineering is still limited, and there are still major uncertainties concerning the impacts these technologies might have on human and natural systems. The self-assertive invasion of nature's various domains, the scale and complexity of the technoscientific tasks involved, the unpredictable long-term impacts of geoengineering actions, and the huge uncertainties that these proposals raise point to a shift in the nature of human action that requires a commensurate ethics of foresight and responsibility. If there is a decision to embark on such an ambitious project, a major effort should be made to scrutinise and gain a deeper understanding of the geoengineering scientific worldview. In fact, the full meaning of geoengineering proposals can only be grasped in the context of the larger social imaginary of science and technology in which geoengineering narratives are rooted. In this paper, two different contextual frameworks from which to address these issues are presented and analysed. The first represents the mainstream Earth System Science perspective, while the second corresponds to an alternative view from the field of social studies of science and technology. Central to both is the concept of an 'epochal break'. In the former, this is in terms of the Human-Earth relationship, in the latter, in terms of the relationship between science, technology and society. It is hoped that this approach may contribute to clearing the path towards more open and critical reflection about the competing interests, values and assumptions of climate engineering proposals. © Common Ground, Paula Curvelo, All Rights Reserved.","Anthropocene; Climate engineering; Earth System Science; Epochal break; Geoengineering; Technoscience",,,,,,"Adam, B., Van Loon, J., Introduction: Repositioning risk; the challenge for social theory (2000) The Risk Society and Beyond-critical Issues for Social Theory, pp. 1-31. , Barbara Adam, Ulrich Beck and Joost van Loon, London: SAGE Publications; Arendt, H., (1958) The Human Condition, , 2nd ed.

Although the incorporation of participatory methods and vulnerability analysis has undoubtedly made valuable contributions to reducing human suffering, these techniques continue the biopolitics of disaster management that early critiques of hazards studies identified three decades ago. This article adopts an analytics of assemblage to analyze the topological transformations in disaster management that sustain its will to truth even as the elements comprising disaster management-for example, bodies, institutions, techniques, strategies, and rationalities-are reconfigured into assemblages of disaster mitigation. Through a genealogy of Jamaican disaster management, I show how participatory and mitigation techniques were deterritorialized from marginalized experiences of disaster and reterritorialized into mitigation policies through the confluence of local disaster events and the global emergence of sustainable development and resilience theory. Rather than offering new forms of empowerment and security from unpredictable change, institutionalized disaster mitigation articulates disaster preparedness with sustainability's calculative foresight and resilience theory's visions of life as an emergent socioecological system to extend logistical orderings of life to the everyday socioecological metabolisms that make up daily existence. Institutionalized mitigation enacts a new series of power relations through an immunitary logic that problematizes adaptability as the source of, and solution to, the threat that disasters pose to neoliberal order. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","assemblage; biopolitics; disaster management; resilience; sustainable development","disaster management; empowerment; genealogy; institutional framework; mitigation; participatory approach; political integration; safety; sustainable development; welfare impact; disaster management; genealogy; institutional framework; mitigation; paradigm shift; planning method; power relations; sustainable development; Jamaica; Jamaica",,,,,"Agamben, G., (2005) State of exception, , Chicago, Chicago,: University of Chicago Press; Agrawal, A., (2005) Environmentality: Technologies of government and the making of subjects, , Durham, NC, Durham, NC,: Duke University Press; Alexander, D., (1993) Natural disasters, , London, London,: Kluwer Academic; Alexander, D., The study of natural disasters 1977-1997: Some reflections on a changing field of knowledge (1997) Disasters, 21 (4), pp. 284-304; Alexander, D., From civil defence to civil protection-And back again (2002) Disaster Prevention and Management, 11 (3), pp. 209-213; Allen, J., Topological twists: Power's shifting geographies (2011) Dialogues in Human Geography, 1 (3), pp. 283-298; Allen, K., Community-based disaster preparedness and climate adaptation: Local capacity-building in the Philippines (2006) Disasters, 30 (1), pp. 81-101; Anderson, B., Security and the future: Anticipating the event of terror (2010) Geoforum, 41, pp. 227-235; Anderson, B., Affect and biopower: Towards a politics of life (2011) Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers NS, 37 (1), pp. 28-43; Anderson, B., Adey, P., Governing events and life: ""Emergency"" in UK civil contingencies (2012) Political Geography, 31 (1), pp. 24-33; Anderson, B., McFarlane, C., Assemblage and geography (2011) Area, 43 (2), pp. 124-127; Bailey, W., Lessons from Gilbert.

Here they outline two concrete cases of cities that are highly active in this field, Hanover and Bristol, showing their aims, the strategies deployed, the levers used and the results obtained. They particularly stress the importance played in these two transitions by the economic and environmental departments coming together on the question, and also by the development of ""multi-partner"" approaches.

In this context, the idea of a transition towards a so-called ""post-carbon"" society has gradually been gaining ground. This has a number of central objectives: the reduction of greenhouse gases by 2050 to one quarter of their 1990 levels (in the countries of the North), near autonomy with regard to carbon-based energies (oil, gas and coal), an adequate capacity for adaptation to climate change and, lastly, greater attention to situations of energy precariousness. This is why in 2009 a programme was launched, steered jointly by the Foresight Mission of the French Ecology Ministry and by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME), called ""Rethinking Cities in a Post-carbon Society"". This programme's work is still on-going towards a final report planned for 2013. This month, Futuribles is devoting a special dossier to it, coordinated by Jacques Theys, who launched this programme, and Éric Vidalenc who now coordinates it with Nathalie Etahiri. Their article, which opens this dossier, outlines the approach and thinking at the heart of this study, which provides a deep analysis of the role cities play -or might play- in the promotion of major developments and changes to encourage a post-carbon society. In it, most importantly, the authors present the six transition scenarios that have been developed with the aim of proposing various possible routes to post-carbon cities in 2050 through highly concrete initiatives and measures in the fields of transport and housing policy, on decisions around energy, housing conditions, lifestyles etc. Lastly, they stress a major issue underlying such an ambition -namely, the way that short-, medium-and long-term goals hang together.",,,,,,,"Leonardo, M., (2012) Oil: The Next Revolution.

Baratier, Beauvais and Métais show how, largely on the basis of its ""Territorial Coherence Plan"" (ScoT), the Tours conurbation has set about equipping itself, in a two-stage process (with target dates of 2020 and 2030), to achieve a post-carbon transition by 2050. They outline the key measures and objectives by sector and major energy consumption element, aiming to modify lifestyles in the conurbation so as to make Tours a ""low carbon"" city, a city of localities. Local public action, which is essential for successfully achieving such a transition, cannot, of course, be effective without convergent efforts at all levels. Lastly, above and beyond this interconnectedness of public policies, the authors stress a number of questions that are equally crucial (in terms of timescales, economic investment, democracy etc.) in the implementation of a ""territorial factor 4"".",,,,,,,"(2011) Interviewé par Thierry Paquot in Urbanisme, 378. , mai-juin","Baratier, J.; ATUFrance",,,,,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

After a presentation of the notion of ""milieu"" (based here on a segmentation using the Socio-milieus® method) and of the typology employed (nine main social milieus, three emergent milieus and 16 contrasting profiles), the authors show the extent to which individuals' carbon footprints vary, depending upon lifestyles, and what a determining effect these lifestyles have in the fields of housing and transport. They then specify the various factors influencing behaviour in the direction of sustainable consumption (or not) and the different types of strategies of intervention that are likely to modify those behaviours. Lastly, they detail two targeted strategies, one aimed at the ""precarious seniors"" milieu and the other at the ""eco-elite"" milieu.

Our brains have special abilities such as empathy and social foresight that allow us to understand each other's feelings and communicate in ways that are unique among all living organisms. Our extraordinary social minds, however, come with some significant strings attached. Our emotional states can be strongly influenced by what others say and do. Our hearts can soar, but they also can be broken. Our bodies use internal chemical messengers-hormones and neurotransmitters-to help guide responses to our social worlds. From romantic daydreams to jealous rage, from orgasm to lactation and parent-child bonding, the powerful molecules produced and released by tiny and otherwise seemingly insignificant cells and glands help orchestrate our thoughts and actions. Understanding this chemical language is important for many research questions in human health. Here we focus on the question of why social relationships can affect health-why it is that words can hurt children. Stress hormones appear to play important roles in this puzzle. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) is highly responsive to traumatic experiences including social challenges. For the past 23 years we have conducted a field study of child stress and family environment in a rural community in Dominica. The primary objective is to document hormonal responses of children to everyday interactions with their parents and other care providers, concomitant with longitudinal assessment of developmental and health outcomes. Results indicate that difficult family environments and traumatic social events are associated with temporal elevations of cortisol and elevated morbidity. The long-term effects of traumatic early experiences on cortisol profiles are complex and indicate domain- specific effects, with normal recovery from physical stressors, but some heightened response to negative-affect social challenges. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that developmental programming of the HPAA and other neuroendocrine systems associated with stress responses may facilitate cognitive targeting to salient social challenges in specific environmental contexts. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

The next morning, townspeople discovered a charred corpse in the ashes. Everyone knew that the store’s owner, Frank Novak, had been sleeping in the store as a safeguard against burglars. Now all that remained were a few of his personal items scattered under the body. At first, it seemed to be a tragic accident mitigated just a bit by Novak’s foresight in buying generous life insurance policies to provide for his family. But soon an investigation by the ambitious new county attorney, M. J. Tobin, turned up evidence suggesting that the dead man might actually be Edward Murray, a hard-drinking local laborer. Relying upon newly developed forensic techniques, Tobin gradually built a case implicating Novak in Murray’s murder. But all he had was circumstantial evidence, and up to that time few murder convictions had been won on that basis in the United States. Others besides Tobin were interested in the case, including several companies that had sold Novak life insurance policies. One agency hired detectives to track down every clue regarding the suspect’s whereabouts. Newspapers across the country ran sensational headlines with melodramatic coverage of the manhunt. Veteran detective Red Perrin’s determined trek over icy mountain paths and dangerous river rapids to the raw Yukon Territory town of Dawson City, which was booming with prospectors as the Klondike gold rush began, made for especially good copy. Skull in the Ashestraces the actions of Novak, Tobin, and Perrin, showing how the Walford fire played a pivotal role in each man’s life. Along the way, author Peter Kaufman gives readers a fascinating glimpse into forensics, detective work, trial strategies, and prison life at the close of the nineteenth century. As much as it is a chilling tale of a cold-blooded murder and its aftermath, this is also the story of three ambitious young men and their struggle to succeed in a rapidly modernizing world. © 2013, by the University of Iowa Press.

Early on Tsar Peter the Great founded St. Petersburg to export goods from Russia's vast but remote interior and by doing so to drive Russia's growth and prosperity. But the new city also had to be fed with grain brought over great distances from those same interior provinces. In this compelling account, Robert E. Jones chronicles how the unparalleled effort put into the building of a wide infrastructure to support the provisioning of the newly created but physically isolated city of St. Petersburg profoundly affected all of Russia's economic life and, ultimately, the historical trajectory of the Russian Empire as a whole. Jones details the planning, engineering, and construction of extensive canal systems that efficiently connected the new capital city to grain and other resources as far away as the Urals, the Volga, and Ukraine. He then offers fresh insights to the state's careful promotion and management of the grain trade during the long eighteenth century. He shows how the government established public granaries to combat shortages, created credit instruments to encourage risk taking by grain merchants, and encouraged the development of capital markets and private enterprise. The result was the emergence of an increasingly important cash economy along with a reliable system of provisioning the fifth largest city in Europe, with the political benefit that St. Petersburg never suffered the food riots common elsewhere in Europe. Thanks to this well-regulated but distinctly free-market trade arrangement, the grain-fueled economy became a wellspring for national economic growth, while also providing a substantial infrastructural foundation for a modernizing Russian state. In many ways, this account reveals the foresight of both Peter I and Catherine II and their determination to steer imperial Russia's national economy away from statist solutions and onto a path remarkably similar to that taken by Western European countries but distinctly different than that of either their Muscovite predecessors or Soviet successors.

It is still ongoing and aims to produce a final report in 2013. The idea of a transition towards a ""postcarbon"" society includes four main objectives: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to one quarter of what they were in 1990; near-autonomy with regard to carbon energies (petrol, gas, coal); an adequate capacity to adapt to climate change and, lastly, greater attention to situations of ""energy precariousness''. As part of the dossier Futuribles is devoting to this programme this month, Cédric Allio, Henri Waisman and Jean-Charles Hourcade present here the study carried out by CIRED (International Research Center on Environment and Development) on the role played by local action in the post-carbon transition. The authors begin by reminding us of the importance of the transport sector in the increase in energy demand and in greenhouse gas emissions, and the need to bring about significant changes in individuals' mobility behaviours if a post-carbon transition on a substantial scale is to be achieved. To do this, local initiatives could be crucial, given their impact on the spatial organization of territories, and could complement the measures put in place at higher levels (national, European or global). This is what clearly emerges from the model developed by CIRED to study the interactions between local and global levels in the post-carbon transition and to provide a macroeconomic frame for the scenarios envisaged in the ""Post-carbon Cities"" programme. The authors offer a comparison of two scenarios for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2050, but doing so by very different transition processes, and they show how, in these two contexts, local and global actions are interconnected and how that connection and a correct spacing of actions over time are crucial for carrying through a post-carbon transition.",,,,,,,"Pierre-Noël, G., (1996) L'Inégalité du Monde.

However, invasions have rarely been directly documented given the resources required and the need for substantial foresight. One method widely used is historical photography interpretation, but this can be hard to verify. We attempt to improve this method by linking historical aerial photos to a paleobotanical analysis of pollen cores. Location: Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands, United States of America. Methods: We chose invasive cattail (Typha) as our model species because it is identifiable from aerial imagery and has persistent, identifiable pollen, and its ecological impacts appear to be time-dependent. We used Geographic Information Systems, aerial photo-interpretation and field verification to post-dict the invasion history of Typha in several wetland ecosystems. Using 210 Pb and 137 Cs sediment dating and pollen classification, we correlated the temporal dominance of Typha to our estimates of per cent coverage at one site. The pollen record was then used to estimate the Typha invasion dynamics for dates earlier than those for which aerial photos were available. Results: Typha spread through time in all study wetlands. Typha pollen dominance increased through time corresponding with increased spatial dominance. Hybrid cattail, T. × glauca increased in pollen abundance relative to T. angustifolia pollen through time. Main conclusions: This study illustrates the value of generating historical invasion maps with publically available aerial imagery and linking these maps with paleobotanical data to study recent (&lt; 100 years) invasions. We determined rates of Typha expansion in two coastal wetland types, validated our mapping methods and modelled the relationship between pollen abundance and wetland coverage, enhancing the temporal precision and breadth of analyses. Our methodology should be replicable with similar invasive plant species.

Despite this foresight, mitochondrial function in dystrophin-deficient muscles has remained poorly defined and unknown in vivo. Here, we used the mdx mouse model of DMD and non-invasive spectroscopy to determine the impact of dystrophin-deficiency on skeletal muscle mitochondrial localization and oxidative phosphorylation function in vivo. Mdx mitochondria exhibited significant uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (reduced P/O) and a reduction in maximal ATP synthesis capacity that together decreased intramuscular ATP levels. Uncoupling was not driven by increased UCP3 or ANT1 expression. Dystrophin was required to maintain subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) pool density, implicating it in the spatial control of mitochondrial localization. Given that nitric oxide-cGMP pathways regulate mitochondria and that sildenafil-mediated phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition ameliorates dystrophic pathology, we tested whether sildenafil's benefits result from decreased mitochondrial dysfunction in mdx mice. Unexpectedly, sildenafil treatment did not affect mitochondrial content or oxidative phosphorylation defects in mdx mice. Rather, PDE5 inhibition decreased resting levels of ATP, phosphocreatine and myoglobin, suggesting that sildenafil improves dystrophic pathology through other mechanisms. Overall, these data indicate that dystrophin-deficiency disrupts SSM localization, promotes mitochondrial inefficiency and restricts maximal mitochondrial ATP-generating capacity. Together these defects decrease intramuscular ATP and the ability of mdx muscle mitochondria to meet ATP demand. These findings further understanding of how mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction contributes to disease pathogenesis in dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle in vivo. © The Author 2012.

Along with the decrease of TB people's attentions to tuberculosis has been reducing significantly, including the medical personnel. In the 1990s, TB returned to increase again, then Emergency Declaration against TB by Minister of Health and Welfare in 1999 drew the public attentions to TB again. Unfortunately, however, there have been many hospitals that cannot deal with TB properly. On the other hand, non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis (NTM) is increasing recently, which bothers many physicians or pulmonologists. ""Japanese Respiratory Society"" (JRS) was founded as ""Japan Society of Chest Diseases"" derived from ""Japanese Society for Tuberculosis"" (JSTB) in 1961, when almost all the members were the members of both the Societies. Now, after 50 years of JRS foundation, only one in four members of JRS may join to JSTB. However, the needs for training opportunities about TB and NTM do exist indeed, which is suggested by the fact that ""Tuberculosis course"", the joint program with JSTB, held in every annual JRS meeting has been filled with a lot of standing audience. In order to support these needs for training about TB, JSTB began the Certification System for TB and NTM in 2011. More than 1,000 certified physicians were born so far. In addition, the decreased number of JSTB members has returned to increase significantly. The most important challenge is to make a future countermeasure against TB and NTM, and also to promote the development of human resources based on the current situation and forecast of TB. This symposium was planned along the theme of this congress, ""TB control for the next generation"" in response to the wishes of the Congress President Dr. Yamagishi. On behalf of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Dr. Yoshizawa talked about the future measures and challenges, and the human resource development for the future, based on the current situation of the medical system for tuberculosis. Dr. Fujita, the chairman of the committee of the certification system, talked about the JSTB Certification System, and the prospect of the human resource development. Dr. Nagai talked about the training opportunities for TB and NTM such as the ""Educational seminar"" in the annual meeting of JSTB or the ""Tuberculosis course"" in the annual meeting of JRS. Nurse and the Public health nurse are also the important members of the medical team for TB. Ms. Nagata talked about the human resources development of nurse responsible for tuberculosis care. Finally, Dr. Kudo, who originally proposed the JSTB Certification System as the chairman of the future planning committee, addressed the history and the foresights of the near future medical care system for TB as a special remark. We wish all the members may share the prospects of future medical care for TB and NTM, which may help for improving the future medical system.",,"article; certification; directly observed therapy; health care delivery; health service; human; Japan; manpower; medical education; medicine; nursing; organization; organization and management; tuberculosis; Certification; Congresses as Topic; Delivery of Health Care; Directly Observed Therapy; Education, Medical; Humans; Japan; Medicine; Tuberculosis; Tuberculosis Societies",,,,,,"Watanabe, A.email: akiwa@idac.tohoku.ac.jp",,,,,,,,00229776,,,"24551952","Japanese","Kekkaku",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897572680

Microbiologists, biotechnologists, ecologists, engineers, and specialists in different areas have experimented and developed new methods for efficient usage of the products produced from microorganisms present in the given environment (Labeda and Shearer 1990; Swings 1992; Sharafi et al. 2010). The availability of microorganisms with highly specific activity, that is, strains possessing useful characteristics, is the basic element for the development of applied and fundamental biotechnology products (Adachi et al. 2003). Observing different fermentation processes in nature, man has chosen different microorganisms for producing bakery products, cheese, wine, and beer (Beishir 1991). Modern microbiology operates actively with strains of actinomycetes, bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and other microorganisms for which morphological, taxonomical, and biochemical characteristics are well studied and documented. A large number of these microorganisms are already in use in the industry. Genetic engineers have performed many experiments for the selection of productive strains and construction of microorganisms with new characteristics. The process of selection of a single industrial strain is a result of the efforts of tens of researchers or, sometimes, several generations of scientists (Sambrook et al. 1989). The development of the modern biotechnology in a given country can be estimated through the quality and quantity of the applied strains in the economy, industrial development, ecological culture, and human health. As a result of this purposeful research, a number of immunological, diagnostic, prophylactic, curative, hormonal, and stimulating bioproducts were prepared and applied in the fields of human and veterinary medicine (Hosoya et al. 1998). Mankind successfully fights a lot of infectious diseases by means of bacterial and viral vaccines nowadays (Hu and Ochi 2001). Microbiological science is also important for agriculture because of its application in forage and silage preparation. With the help of microorganisms, soil fertility can be improved and the processes of biosynthesis and plant bioconservation can be regulated and directed. Microorganisms are widely applied in the food-processing industry for preparation of new foodstuffs; for improvement and preservation of food flavor, taste, and digestibility; and for protein and carbohydrate synthesis (Vinci and Byng 1999). The process of preservation of a variety of foods is performed by microorganisms. Microorganisms are also used in the chemical and pharmacological industry for preparation of different organic compounds, such as organic acids, enzymes, vitamins, antibiotics, alcohols, vinegar, etc. (Donev 001). The biotechnology has found its place in the oil- and ore-extracting industry for obtaining oil and metals from rich deposits. The waste-free technologies and the biological-type purification plants using microbiological methods for environmental protection are of significance for the industry (Claus 1989). It is important to emphasize that the microorganisms were an essential part of the natural cycles, and their preservation is as important for any other biological process. The main work for any microbiologist consists of isolation, selection, investigation, improvement, and genetic modification of different natural strains for different purposes. The conservation of the microbial vitality, specificity, activity, and immunogenicity, that is, the preservation of the scientific achievements in the area of the applied microbiology, is of prime significance. The conservation and preservation of microbiological samples is an important task. At present, it is related to the processes of standardization and preparation of products of high quality, but it also involves foresight into the future development of the biotechnology (Boeswinkel 1976; Vinci and Byng 1999). © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Bakery products; Beer; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Biotechnology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Ecology; Environmental technology; Food microbiology; Food processing; Oils and fats; Vaccines; Veterinary medicine; Viruses; Biochemical characteristics; Biotechnology products; Carbohydrate synthesis; Food processing industry; Genetic modifications; Industrial development; Microbiological methods; Scientific achievements; Bacteria",,,,,"Adachi, O., Moonmangmee, D., Toyama, H., Yamada, M., Shinagawa, E., Matsushita, K., New developments in oxidative fermentation (2003) Appl.
