Despite almost two decades of research, no studies explored how family context variables relate to the development of this ability. The objectives of this study were to explore the association of socioeconomic status (SES), parental consideration of future consequences (CFC), and family environment quality on the development of episodic foresight and to compare the magnitude of the effects of these same variables on delay of gratification and planning. Sixty-four dyads composed by 4-year-old Uruguayan children and their main caregiver participated in the study. Children were administered experiments on episodic foresight, delay of gratification, planning, and receptive language. Parents reported socioeconomic status, family environment, and their consideration of future consequences. Even though parents’ limit setting was associated to higher EF in children and parental CFC-I was a predictor in multiple regression analysis, these effects ceased to be significant when controlled by child’s receptive language and caregiver education, being these the main predictors of EF. Results also indicate that SES significantly distinguishes the performance in future-oriented skills and language, being the magnitude of the effect higher for EF in comparison with planning and delay of gratification. This study supports that EF is related to SES to a greater extent than other variables traditionally assessed in studies of poverty and child development. We discuss implications of low SES and language skills in the light of EF development and immediate-oriented behavior in contexts of deprivation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Child poverty; Cognitive development; Consideration of future consequences; Episodic foresight; Family environment",,,,,,"Adams, J., White, M., Time perspective in socioeconomic inequalities in smoking and body mass index (2009) Health Psychology, 28, p. 83; (2007) Report of the APA task force on socioeconomic status, , American Psychological Association, Washington, DC; Andre, L., van Vianen, A.E., Peetsma, T.T., Adolescents’ and parents’ regulatory focus as determinants of future time perspective on school and professional career (2017) Learning and Individual Differences, 59, pp. 34-42; Arranz, E.B., Olabarrieta, F., Manzano, A., Martín, J.L., Galende, N., Etxadi–Gangoiti scale: A proposal to evaluate the family contexts of two-year-old children (2014) Early Child Development and Care, 184 (6), pp. 933-948; Atance, C., Jackson, L., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102, pp. 379-391; Atance, C., O’Neill, D., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Science, 5, pp. 533-539; Atance, C., O’Neill, D., The emergence of episodic future thinking in humans (2005) Learning & Motivation, 36, pp. 126-144; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20 (3), pp. 341-361; Baigorri, P., (2015) Análisis de la influencia del contexto familiar en el desarrollo cognitivo de niñas y niños de 4 años, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation.

For this purpose, applying a systematic approach to study the future of health information technology is essential. The key technology is one of the approaches used in the foresight studies and it is conducted by interviewing experts. The aim of this study was to use key technology approach to identify the most important health information technologies for Iran until 2025. This qualitative study was conducted in two phases. The first phase was related to developing a mind map of health information technologies based on the literature review and an expert panel results. In the second phase, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 experts to identify the key health information technologies for Iran until 2025. In the first phase, content analysis and in the second phase, framework analysis was used to analyze data. According to the results, the main themes were immediate, cheap, stable, and secure access to the maximum health records of the entire population, equitable access to resources and services of the health counter, development of knowledge management in medical and health sciences, development of governmental electronic services (backup) in health system, development of m-health, IT governance in health and development of national HIT infrastructure. In total, 19 key health information technologies were identified which were related to the main themes. The development of electronic health records, national health information network, data sharing, patient’s personal health record (PHR), m-health, clinical decision support systems and health information technology infrastructure were found to be the most important health information technologies for Iran until 2025. It seems that identifying key health information technologies can help to facilitate strategic and operational planning in this area and help to allocate resources realistically. © 2019 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

The paper offers the outcomes of the foresight study of the Russian renewable energy sector and focuses on three areas: converting solar energy into electricity; converting wind energy into electricity; and converting biomass into thermal energy and electricity. The goal of the study was to foresee and agree on the visionary future for the nascent renewable energy sector in the country, as well as to provide the scientifically justified grounds for government and corporate decision-makers. The research is based on a mixture of methods: bibliometric analysis and text mining, literature review, expert surveys and interviews, workshops, STEEPV analysis of trends, scenario analysis, and applied policy analysis. As a result of the study, major trends and uncertainties that may affect the Russian and global renewable energy sector in the next 15–20 years were identified. Other results include the scenarios for Russia's renewable energy sector that are proposed together with recommendations for the Russian companies and public authorities.

Long-term climate foresight studies have structured their recent analyses around five socio-economic pathways (SSPs), with consistent storylines of future macroeconomic and societal developments; however, model quantification of these scenarios shows substantial heterogeneity in land-use projections. Here we build on a recently developed sensitivity approach to identify how future land use depends on six distinct socio-economic drivers (population, wealth, consumption preferences, agricultural productivity, land-use regulation, and trade) and their interactions. Spread across models arises mostly from diverging sensitivities to long-term drivers and from various representations of land-use regulation and trade, calling for reconciliation efforts and more empirical research. Most influential determinants for future cropland and pasture extent are population and agricultural efficiency. Furthermore, land-use regulation and consumption changes can play a key role in reducing both land use and food-security risks, and need to be central elements in sustainable development strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; cropland; driver; empirical research; food security; human; pasture; productivity; sustainable development",,,,,"(2000), IPCC.

In this paper, we identify systematically what particular software competencies are required in the future energy systems focusing on electricity system smart grids. The realizations of that can then be roadmapped to specific software capabilities of the different future ‘software houses’ across the networks. Our instrumental method is software competence development scenario path construction with environmental scanning of the related systems elements. The vision of future software-enabled smart energy systems with software houses is mapped with the already progressing scenarios of energy systems transitions on the one hand coupled with the technology foresight of software on the other hand. Grounding on the Smart Grid Reference Architecture Model (SGAM), it tabulates the distinguished software competencies and attributes them to the different parties—including customers/consumers (Internet of People, IoP)—involved in future smart energy systems. The resulting designations can then be used to recognize and measure the necessary software competencies (e.g., fog computing) in order to be able to develop them in-house, or for instance to partner with software companies, depending on the future desirability. Software-intensive systems development competence becomes one of the key success factors for such cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). Further futures research work is chartered with the Futures Map frame. This paper contributes preliminarily toward that by identifying pictures of the software-enabled futures and the connecting software competence-based scenario paths. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cyber-physical-social systems; Digital transformation; Futures map; Smart grid; Software competence; Systems thinking",,,,,,"Kettunen, P., Laanti, M., Future software organizations—agile goals and roles (2017) Eur J Futur Res, 5, p. 16; Kuusi, O., Cuhls, K., Steinmüller, K., The futures map and its quality criteria (2015) Eur J Futur Res, 3, p. 22; (2012) Smart grid reference architecture.

This study aimed to clarify the rate, etiological factors and outcomes of neonatal seizures, and a possible foresight of neonatal death in Iraq. A prospective cohort study was conducted in neonates with seizures admitted to 3 major neonatology centers in Baghdad, Iraq, from 1st of December 2017 till the end of May 2018. Both term and preterm neonates affected by seizures were recruited with a total number of 203 patients. Perinatal asphyxia (n = 81; 39.90%), infection (n = 77; 37.93%), and metabolic abnormalities (n = 52; 25.62%) were most common causes for seizures. Death occurred in 66 neonates (32.51%), with higher mortality rates found in preterm neonates. Six adverse prognostic indicators were shown to be significant: positive pressure resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, perinatal asphyxia, infection, gestational age (preterm babies), and low birth weight (&lt; 2,500 g). Neonatal seizures may be the first manifestation of neurological insults, and they are most commonly caused by perinatal asphyxia, followed by infection, and metabolic disturbances. Prevention of neonatal seizures is much more important than the treatment of them for the reduction of neonatal mortality. The effective strategies should therefore be proper medical care and management for mothers and neonates before, during and after delivery to prevent neonatal infections, perinatal asphyxia, low birth weight, prematurity, metabolic abnormalities, and other risk factors of neonatal seizures. © 2018 Tohoku University Medical Press.","Etiology; Iraq; Mortality prediction; Neonatal fit; Outcomes","Article; artificial ventilation; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; gestational age; hospital admission; human; infantile spasm; infection; Iraq; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; medical care; metabolic disorder; mortality rate; neonatology; newborn; newborn death; newborn mortality; obstetric delivery; outcome assessment; perinatal asphyxia; prematurity; prenatal care; prognostic assessment; prospective study; resuscitation; risk factor; sex; epidemiology; infant; infant mortality; mortality; newborn disease; seizure; treatment outcome; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Iraq; Male; Seizures; Treatment Outcome",,,,,"Alcover-Bloch, E., Campistol, J., Iriondo-Sanz, M., Neonatal seizures, our experience (2004) Rev.

The goal is to develop foresight—insight into how and why the future could be different than today—to improve policy, planning, and decision making. Scores of futures research methods have been developed or adapted from other disciplines, beginning with pioneering work in the US military and RAND Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s. But many social scientists and natural resource professionals are unaware of these methods and most have never heard of futures research as a distinct field of study.

This paper analyses the impact of foresight towards decarbonization targets on the investment decisions in the European electricity sector using a specific model developed by the authors called dynELMOD. Incorporating the climate targets makes the investment into any additional fossil capacity uneconomic from 2025 onwards, resulting in a coal and natural gas phase-out in the 2040s. Limited foresight thus results in stranded investments of fossil capacities in the 2020s. Using a CO2 budgetary approach, on the other hand, leads to an even sharper emission reduction in the early periods before 2030, reducing overall costs. We also find that renewables carry the major burden of decarbonization; nuclear power (3rd or 4th generation) is unable to compete with other fuels and will, therefore, be phased out over time. © 2019","Decarbonization; Dynamic investment models; Electricity sector models; European electricity market; Limited foresight; Nuclear phase-out","Budget control; Decarbonization; Depreciation; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Emission control; Investments; Nuclear fuels; Electricity generation; Electricity sector; Electricity sector decarbonizations; Emission reduction; Investment decisions; Investment models; Limited foresight; Nuclear phase-out; Fossil fuels; carbon emission; electricity generation; emission control; energy market; energy planning; energy use; European Union; fossil fuel; future prospect; investment incentive; numerical model",,,,,"EC, Energy Roadmap 2050 (2011); Pfenninger, S., Hawkes, A., Keirstead, J., Energy systems modeling for twenty-first century energy challenges (2014) Renew.

We use the overlapping-generation model of Grandmont (1985), which displays multiple perfect-foresight equilibria, including periodic and chaotic dynamics. The equilibrium selection problem is not solved under learning, as each outcome is predicted by at least one existing learning theory. We find that subjects in the lab systematically coordinate on an equilibrium despite the complexity of the environment. Coordination only happens on simple equilibria, in this case the steady state or the period-two cycle, a result which is predicted only if the subjects follow simple learning rules. This suggests that relevant perfect-foresight equilibria should be robust to the use of simple rules. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Complex dynamics; Equilibrium selection; Laboratory experiments; Learning",,,,,,"Aliprantis, C.D., Plott, C.R., Competitive equilibria in overlapping generations experiments (1992) Econ.

In an empirical demonstration, we investigate experts' views and perceptions of possible future disruption caused by digitalization in an established machine-building industry. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed method in detecting future worldviews of experts grouped by their position in the value chain. The results show polarized responses, with considerable clustering among groups. For example, respondents who were inclined to view digital technologies as disruptive (i.e., as changing the paradigm of value creation in machine-building) also viewed them as related more to service and business models than to products and operation. We discuss the theoretical and practical contributions of the proposed method and suggest fruitful avenues for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Disruptive technologies; Industry transformation; Strategy formation; Technology foresight; Visual analogue scale","Technological forecasting; Digital technologies; Disruptive technology; Industry experts; Machine building; Machine building industry; Strategy formation; Technology foresight; Visual analogue scale; Construction industry",,,,,"Adner, R., When are technologies disruptive?

With its experience of planning systems, China resorts to state intervention in economic and social activities, which profoundly includes research and innovation. The government organizes and governs a vast national science and technology system, most of which is in the state sector, demonstrating the importance and relevance of its research and innovation policy. In this study, 343 innovation policy items, collected in our sample for the period 1990 and 2013, have been scrutinized in a three dimension analytical framework for policy instruments, objectives and implementation. We then abstract and conceptualize the results and findings arrived at the study. Targeted and general purpose policy instruments are categorized. Patterns have emerged revealing the linkages between the targeted policy instruments and the policy objectives. The results and findings based conceptualization contributes to innovate the thinking in innovation policy configuration to advance national innovation constructs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Innovation policy; Policy implementation; Policy instruments; Policy objectives; R&D; S&T; STI","Technological forecasting; Innovation policies; National innovations; Policy implementations; Policy instruments; Policy objectives; Science and Technology; Social activities; State intervention; Public policy; future prospect; government; innovation; policy implementation; research and development; science and technology; technology policy; China",,,,,"Bemelmans-Videc, M.-L., Rist, R.C., Vedung, E.O., Carrots, Sticks & Sermons: Policy Instruments & Their Evaluation (1998), Transaction Publishers New Brunswick, NJ; Bloomberg, Most Innovative in the World 2014: Countries (2014), http://www.bloomberg.com/slideshow/2014-01-22/30-most-innovative-countries.html, Bloomberg New York; (2015), http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-innovative-countries/, Bloomberg Most Innovative in the World 2015: Countries.

Drawing on the concepts of technology foresight, a methodology was developed for future technology research. Future technologies were identified by consulting editorials of journals specializing in oncology. Nine technologies were selected with the potential to impact cancer care in the future. Additionally, a method was developed for consulting a large number of experts from articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science. In this survey, more than 83,000 cancer specialists were invited to answer a web survey in which they expressed their expectations about the future of cancer care. The questionnaire was answered by 2408 specialists, 56% of whom stated they were highly knowledgeable experts. Our results show that antibody-related therapies, molecular imaging, and tumor delivery systems are the technologies most likely to be used in cancer care in the next thirty years. The main reasons pointed out for the choice of these technologies were improvements in the prognosis of the disease and improved diagnostic reliability. Meanwhile, knowledge and scientific barriers were highlighted as the main obstacles to the development of the technologies deemed to have more limited chances of success. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cancer care; future; future technology; technology foresight; web survey",,,,,,"Adegbile, A., Sarpong, D., Meissner, D., Strategic Foresight for Innovation Management: A Review and Research Agenda (2017) International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management, 14 (4), p. 1750019. , https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219877017500195; Alix-Panabieres, C., Pantel, K., Circulating Tumor Cells: Liquid Biopsy of Cancer (2013) Clinical Chemistry, , https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2012.194258; (2018), http://www.asgct.org/general-public/educational-resources/gene-therapy-and-cell-therapy-for-diseases/cancer-gene-and-cell-therapy, Cancer Gene Therapy and Cell Therapy. 2018; Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Innovation System Foresight (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 88, pp. 276-286. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2014.06.016; Augusto, C., Gadelha, G., Mota, F., Cassiolato, J., Gadelha, C., Augusto, C., Gadelha, G., Futuro Da Pesquisa, Desenvolvimento Tecnológico e Produção Industrial de Biofarmacêuticos No Brasil (2014) Rev Eletron de Comun Inf Inov Saúde, 8 (4), pp. 461-477. , https://doi.org/10.3395/reciis.v8i4.897.pt; Banday, A.H., Jeelani, S., Hruby, V.J., Cancer Vaccine Adjuvants–Recent Clinical Progress and Future Perspectives (2015) Immunopharmacology and Immunotoxicology, 37 (1), pp. 1-11; Barata, P., Sood, A.K., Hong, D.S., RNA-Targeted Therapeutics in Cancer Clinical Trials: Current Status and Future Directions (2016) Cancer Treatment Reviews, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2016.08.004; Benjamin, R., Berges, B.K., Solis-Leal, A., Igbinedion, O., Strong, C.L., Schiller, M.R., TALEN Gene Editing Takes Aim on HIV (2016) Human Genetics, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-016-1678-2; Bloom, N., Jones, C., Van Reenen, J., Webb, M., (2017) CEP Discussion Paper, , http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/86588/1/dp1496.pdf, Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find? 1496: 53; Burnett, J.C., Rossi, J.J., RNA-Based Therapeutics: Current Progress and Future Prospects (2012) Chemistry & Biology, 19 (1), pp. 60-71. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2011.12.008; Chiocca, E.A., Rabkin, S.D., Oncolytic Viruses and Their Application to Cancer Immunotherapy (2014) Cancer Immunology Research, 2 (4), pp. 295-300. , https://doi.org/10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0015; Ciarli, T., Coad, A., Rafols, I., (2013) Nesta Working Paper, , http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/quantitative-analysis-technology-futures-part-1, Quantitative Analysis of Technology Futures - Part 1. 13/08 (13): 64; Coates, J.F., The Future of Foresight—A US Perspective (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1428-1437. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2010.07.009; Couper, M.P., Miller, P.V., Web Survey Methods: Introduction (2008) Public Opinion Quarterly, , https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfn066; Crowley, E., Di Nicolantonio, F., Loupakis, F., Bardelli, A., Liquid Biopsy: Monitoring Cancer-Genetics in the Blood (2013) Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, , https://doi.org/10.1038/nrclinonc.2013.110; Cuhls, K., From Forecasting to Foresight Processes?

By taking a neo-Schumpeterian perspective on sustainability transition and adopting a bottom-up foresight methodology, namely a (3-stage)policy-learning Delphi approach drawing on a (29-strong)panel of experts belonging to a variety of institutional sectors (public, business, academic actors, as well as NGOs)from diverse geographical backgrounds (11 countries across 3 continents), the study explores Circular Economy's key characteristics and appraises the fundamental strategies and trade-offs that must be understood and managed for transition. The evidence gathered through the participatory exercise, contrasted with prior knowledge from systematic literature reviews, suggests that Circular Economy is both a holistic concept and an operational tool. Results strongly suggest systemic eco-innovation, powered by multidimensional policies, as the key to unlock deep transition. In particular, over the next 20 years Circular Economy development is more than technological and economic puzzle-solving; it will be contingent on the ability to creatively overcome real political trade-offs and broader societal challenges needing to include in their action more social and behavioural considerations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Delphi; Eco-innovation; Policy; Sustainability; Transition","Commerce; Public policy; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Delphi; Eco-innovation; Key characteristics; Operational tools; Sustainability transition; Systematic literature review; Transition; Economic and social effects",,,,,"Albu, A., Business innovation using industrial ecology (2011) Metal.

This capacity has become a popular and rapidly growing topic of interdisciplinary research. Perhaps the most influential and frequently tested neuroscientific hypothesis in this domain is that the hippocampus is a hub in a critical neural network for mental time travel, support for which is now commonly assumed by most researchers in the area. In light of recent findings revealing limitations with existing measures of episodic foresight, we critically evaluate the available evidence for this hypothesis and find that it is inconclusive. We suggest that this is due in significant part to the exclusive and widespread reliance on noisy verbal measures and discuss this case as an example of a more general issue pertaining to the measurement of episodic foresight. Accordingly, we suggest that an essential focus of future research should concern the development of objective measures that capture capacity differences by requiring people to put foresight not just into words, but into action. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Foresight; Measurement; Memory; Mental simulation; Prospection","episodic memory; hippocampus; human; human experiment; review; simulation; travel",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Sacchetti, D.C., Ally, B.A., Budson, A.E., Schacter, D.L., Episodic simulation of future events is impaired in mild Alzheimer's disease (2009) Neuropsychologia, 47 (12), pp. 2660-2671; Addis, D.R., Schacter, D., The Hippocampus and imagining the future: Where do we stand?

Episodic foresight is considered a complex form of prospection that enables people to generate mental models of future scenarios with which to guide actions. In this article, we systematically review the available episodic foresight measurement instruments. PubMed and PsycInfo were searched through July, 2017 and manual searches of published reviews and snowball searches of included studies were also performed. The initial search yielded 970 records after the removal of duplicates, of which 363 underwent full-text screening. Studies that did not measure the imagination of future scenarios in adult humans, or that were not reported in English, were excluded. The review consists of 303 articles classified into two broad categories, content measures and generation measures, that were further subdivided into one or more of six subcategories: (i) phenomenology (60%); (ii) examination (49%); (iii) fluency (12%); (iii) reaction time (12%); sentence completion (5%); and thought sampling (2%). We catalogue the available instruments in these sections, and provide a summary overview of each category. Following phenomenological measures, the adapted Autobiographical Interview and measures of specificity were the most frequently used instruments. We conclude that none of the available instruments have been appropriately validated for use, and therefore suggest caution with the use of any of the included measures. The development of behavioural measures designed to capture degrees of episodic foresight ability in functionally relevant contexts among humans would provide a major advance over the currently available instruments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Future thinking; Future thought; Mental simulation; Mental time travel; Prospection","adult; article; female; human; human experiment; imagination; interview; male; Medline; phenomenology; PsycINFO; publication; reaction time; simulation; systematic review; thinking; travel",,,,,"Abram, M., Picard, L., Navarro, B., Piolino, P., Mechanisms of remembering the past and imagining the future – new data from autobiographical memory tasks in a lifespan approach (2014) Consciousness and Cognition, 29, pp. 76-89; Addis, D.R., Musicaro, R., Pan, L., Schacter, D.L., Episodic simulation of past and future events in older adults: Evidence from an experimental recombination task (2010) Psychology and Aging, 25, pp. 369-376; Addis, D.R., Roberts, R.P., Schacter, D.L., Age-related neural changes in autobiographical remembering and imagining (2011) Neuropsychologia, 49, pp. 3656-3669; Addis, D.R., Schacter, D.L., Constructive episodic simulation: Temporal distance and detail of past and future events modulate hippocampal engagement (2008) Hippocampus, 18, pp. 227-237; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Age-related changes in the episodic simulation of future events (2008) Psychological Science, 19, pp. 33-41; Anderson, R.J., Dewhurst, S.A., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Differences in event specificity of spontaneously generated thought (2009) Memory (Hove England), 17, pp. 367-373; Anelli, F., Ciaramelli, E., Arzy, S., Frassinetti, F., Age-related effects on future mental time travel (2016) Neural Plasticity; Anelli, F., Ciaramelli, E., Arzy, S., Frassinetti, F., Prisms to travel in time: Investigation of time-space association through prismatic adaptation effect on mental time travel (2016) Cognition, 156, pp. 1-5; Ansuini, C., Cavallo, A., Pia, L., Becchio, C., The role of perspective in mental time travel (2016) Neural Plasticity; Arzy, S., Adi-Japha, E., Blanke, O., The mental time line: An analogue of the mental number line in the mapping of life events (2009) Consciousness and Cognition, 18, pp. 781-785; Arzy, S., Bick, A., Blanke, O., Mental time in amnesia: Evidence from bilateral medial temporal damage before and after recovery (2009) Cognitive Neuropsychology, 26, pp. 503-510; Arzy, S., Collette, S., Ionta, S., Fornari, E., Blanke, O., Subjective mental time: The functional architecture of projecting the self to past and future (2009) The European Journal of Neuroscience, 30, pp. 2009-2017; Arzy, S., Molnar-Szakacs, I., Blanke, O., Self in time: Imagined self-location influences neural activity related to mental time travel (2008) Journal of Neuroscience, 28, pp. 6502-6507; Atance, C.M., Young children's thinking about the future (2015) Child Developement Perspectives, 9, pp. 178-182; Baddeley, A.D., Wilson, B., Amnesia, autobiographical memory, and confabualtion (1986) Autobiographical memory, pp. 225-252. , D.C.

However, the dynamic changes experienced in both sectors create the necessity to re-evaluate their individual profiles and the binary divide between them. Against this background a series of interlinked foresight studies on the perspectives and challenges of the Austrian Universities of Applied Sciences have been realized between 2010 and 2016, including a literature based trend analysis, a delphi study and explorative scenarios.

Few applications exist in fisheries science. A rigorous methodology was applied to draw potential areas for future research on diadromous fishes circa 2030 that could be useful to a broader audience of European fisheries scientists. Diadromous fishes are species that migrate between fresh waters and the sea to complete their life cycle. First, twenty drivers were identified and fell within the scope of (i) diadromous fish conservation, (ii) their place and roles in modern societies, (iii) the main features of the world of science and research, and (iv) the main characteristics of research activities on this biological group. Past and future driver developments (i.e. retrospective analysis and hypotheses respectively) were examined. Then, the combination of drivers’ hypotheses within each of the four components listed above led to micro-scenarios describing how the components could plausibly change in the next fifteen years. Finally, global scenarios were obtained by juxtaposing four micro-scenarios, one for each of the components. Challenges that were identified from these global scenarios were mostly structural, intellectual with frequent revisions of theoretical and unchallenged concepts and ethical, and can be useful to better inform future changes in priorities and focus areas, technical investments, and funding opportunities operated by laboratories or individual researchers working on diadromous fishes. Also, this case study exploring the role of foresight in guiding research, particularly the part on the methodological description, could be of relevance for researchers in general. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diadromous fishes; Futures study; Research activities; Scenarios; Strategic orientations","fish; fishery; future prospect; migratory species; research work; scenario analysis; strategic approach; Europe; Pisces",,,,,"Amara, R., Selleslagh, J., Billon, G., Minier, C., Growth and condition of 0-group European flounder, Platichthys flesus, as indicator of estuarine habitat quality (2009) Hydrobiologia, 627, pp. 87-98; Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, 46, pp. 23-40; Angervall, P., Gustafsson, J., Becoming an academic researcher (2014) Policy Futures in Education, 12 (2), pp. 191-199; Beesley, L.G.A., Science policy in changing times: Are governments poised to take full advantage of an institution in transition?

However, we know that personal experience, sociocultural, and organizational background contribute to the select of time management strategies. Aim: To explore the clinical nurses' experiences of time management strategies. Design: Qualitative content analysis. Methods: Data was collected using purposive sampling from 17 clinical nurses. Data collection began using unstructured, in-depth face-to-face interviews and was continued as semi-structured. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the inductive content analysis approach proposed by Graneheim and Lundman (2004). Results: The clinical nurses managed time/tasks delegated to the nursing team through the dynamic self-regulation process involving workload estimation, foresight, compendious-orientation, self-working style and skill development, extra-role performance behaviors, selective choice of activities, seeking help from others, contingency division of labor, and discipline-orientation. Discussion: The work-shift was surrounded by uncertain conditions. In these conditions, the clinical nurses required more time management skills to provide maximum and high priority care based on a dynamic self-regulation process by the nursing team. Conclusion: Clinical nurses can manage their time/tasks and perform maximum and high priority tasks delegated to the nursing team by an optimal use of time, use of facilities and opportunities for saving time, extend available time, and prevent a waste of time based on the dynamic self-regulation process. © 2018 Australian College of Nursing Ltd","Clinical nurse; Compendious-orientation; Discipline-orientation; Dynamic self-regulation; Extra-role performance behaviors; Foresight; Qualitative study; Time/task management","article; autoregulation; content analysis; genetic transcription; human; human experiment; interview; nurse; qualitative research; skill; time management; workload",,,,,"Al‐Araidah, O., Momani, A., Khasawneh, M., Momani, M., Lead‐time reduction utilizing lean tools applied to healthcare: The inpatient pharmacy at a local hospital (2010) Journal for Healthcare Quality, 32 (1), pp. 59-66; Barrick, M.R., Mount, M.K., Select on conscientiousness and emotional stability.

Although plausibility is presented as a necessary (but not sufficient)criterion for assessing future scenarios, there is no consensus on its meaning or operationalization. The main objective of this paper is to contribute to clarifying the meaning of plausibility and the theoretical role it plays in the application of scenario building practices to technological governance. In particular, I will argue that plausibility can be understood as a methodological criterion and as an anticipatory-enabling ‘epistemic device.’ In this sense, I support the value of theoretically distinguishing between the methodological-limiting and the anticipatory-enabling roles of plausibility in foresight practices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anticipation; Epistemology; Future scenarios; Heuristics; Plausibility; Technological governance","future prospect; governance approach; heuristics; participatory approach; technological development",,,,,"Aligica, P.D., Scenarios and the growth of knowledge: Notes on the epistemic element in scenario building (2005) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 72 (7), pp. 815-824; Alvial-Palavicino, C., The future as practice.

It is generally believed that correcting myopia is a rationale for a pay-as-you-go (PAYG)pension system. This view has been supported by existing literature showing that the optimal PAYG social security tax should increase when people are more myopic. In this paper we obtain new results opposed to the traditional view. By establishing a very standard general equilibrium OLG model with myopic agents and endogenized marginal product of capital, we show that the optimal social security tax should be lower when people are more myopic. Our numerical analysis also shows that the welfare cost of the social security tax increases with people's degree of myopia. These results suggest that correcting myopia is not a clear rationale for the PAYG social security. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Myopic behaviors; PAYG pensions; Social security tax",,,,,,"Adam, C.S., Bevan, D.L., Fiscal deficits and growth in developing countries (2005) J.

Managing natural resources in the Australian context is also a complex task because it involves a raft of stakeholders subjected to ongoing institutional changes and reductions in funding for programme implementation. This paper explores the use of scenario planning as a suitable tool to deal with the uncertainty and complexity inherent to natural resource management. Specifically, it reports on the development and application of explorative scenarios (multiple plausible futures) involving six natural resource management organisations and their communities of practice operating along the East Coast of Australia. Scenarios were developed based on two key drivers of change, namely: maturing approach to natural resource management; and community driven climate change action, to test the robustness and flexibility of a suite of existing strategies, policies and targets. Findings indicate that explorative scenarios were useful in the identification of strategies that may result in perverse or negative impacts under different futures; guide selection of different approaches in response to unexpected events; encourage a forward-looking approach rather than relying on past experiences only; create flexible, robust strategies that are better able to deal with shocks and surprises; provide participating policy owners with an opportunity to consider future contexts for their policies to play out in; and, ascertain a range of possible pathways to achieve a vision or goals depending on changed circumstances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Collaborative planning; Ecosystem services; Environmental planning; Foresight; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Adams, V.M., Álvarez-Romero, J.G., Capon, S.J., Crowley, G.M., Dale, A.P., Kennard, M.J., Douglas, M.M., Pressey, R.L., Making time for space: the critical role of spatial planning in adapting natural resource management to climate change (2017) Environ.

The disciplines of futures studies and history have much in common: historians have often been concerned with the future, and researchers in futures studies and foresight have noted the importance of working with history. Green (2012) suggests that ‘thinking with history’ is a valuable approach for futures researchers. In this paper, however, I argue that ‘thinking with heritage’ offers another approach towards engaging with the past, and one that is better suited to some kinds of futures work. I distinguish between two kinds of future narrative. ‘Instrumental futures’ (Michael, 2000) are concerned with using ideas of the future to further unexamined present-day interests: they are abstract and exchangeable, being removed from any particular social context. In contrast, ‘lived futures’, following Adam and Groves (2007), are concerned with particular places and groups, depending not just on future imaginaries at large in society but also the material and affective aspects of the social relations within which these groups are embedded. I suggest that futures research that aims to have a positive social impact should concern itself with recognising and developing lived futures over instrumental futures, and that thinking with heritage – engaging with the past through the interests and values of particular groups – is well-suited to supporting this. The argument draws on the different ways in which time is represented in these different ways of engaging with pasts and futures. Instrumental futures, in common with historicised accounts of the past, make use of a universal ‘empty time’ to sequence events or project extrapolations forward. Lived futures, alongside heritage, work with a ‘thick present’ in which past, present and future are interwoven through particular subjectivities. For futures researchers with an interest in further understanding and developing futures that are connected to the cares and interests of particular communities, I suggest that engaging with these communities’ heritage would be a practical way of ensuring that their work remains meaningful. © 2019","Care; Empty Time; Heritage; Historicity; History; Latent Futures; Lived Futures; Subjectivity; Temporality; Thick Present","future prospect; history; research; social impact",,,,,"Adam, B., History of the future: Paradoxes and challenges (2010) Rethinking History: The Journal of Theory and Practice, 14 (3), pp. 361-378; Adam, B., Groves, C., Future matters: Action, knowledge, ethics (2007), Brill; Aligica, P.D., Prediction, explanation and the epistemology of future studies (2003) Futures, 35, pp. 1027-1040; Andersson, J., Keizer, A.-G., Governing the future: Science, policy and public participation in the construction of the long term in the Netherlands and Sweden (2014) History and Technology, 30 (1-2), pp. 104-122; Archer, M., The reflexive imperative in late modernity (2012), Cambridge University Press; Barthel-Bouchier, D., Cultural heritage and the challenge of sustainability (2016), Routledge; Bauman, Z., Liquid modernity (2000), 9th ed.

Background: The twenty-first century has a potential for social, cultural, economic and even political changes due to technological developments. Students should be aware of new technological trends that will influence their profession in the future to be ready for them. Design: A descriptive and cross-sectional study. Settings: At two well-established universities (a public and a private university) in a metropolitan city in Turkey with a total of 473 students. Methods: The study was carried out using an information form and a foresight questionnaire for IoT developed by the researchers. The data were analyzed using parametric tests with SPSS. Results: Of the participants, 70.8% were female, 81.6% were studying at a public university, 61.3% were senior nursing students, and 38.7% were senior medical students. A majority of the students stated that the IoT technology will affect future medical and nursing practices. The nursing students obtained the highest mean score on the item “Basic physical measurements such as blood sugar, heart rate and ECGs will be easier using IoT technology” (7.36 ± 2.27), and the lowest mean score (5.36 ± 2.82) on the item “Robot physicians and nurses developed through IoT technology will provide patient healthcare in the future”. The nursing and medical students' opinions regarding the future of IoT technology focused on the issues such as smart vital follow-up of patients, mobile health, patient data security, biomedical applications, wearable technologies, and nursing practices in chronic diseases and home care. Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that IoT technology should be involved in nursing and medical education, and further studies should be conducted to integrate technological trends into healthcare and nursing practices. Implications for Nursing Practice and Health Policies: The future of IoT technology will focus on subjects such as vital follow-up of patients, monitoring patients with wearable technologies, and nursing practices in chronic diseases and home care. Competency in IoT technology should be included as a requirement in healthcare faculties' professional development policies and programs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Future; Healthcare; Medical students; Nursing students; Technology; The internet of things","adult; attitude to computers; cross-sectional study; female; forecasting; human; Internet; male; medical student; medical technology; nursing student; perception; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; turkey (bird); university; young adult; Adult; Attitude to Computers; Biomedical Technology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Internet; Male; Perception; Students, Medical; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Turkey; Universities; Young Adult",,,,,"Ahmed, H.S., Ali, A.A., Smart intensive care unit design based on wireless sensor network and internet of things (2016) Al-Sadeq International Conference on Multidisciplinary in IT and Communication Science and Applications (AIC-MITCSA), , (Iraq); Aktas, F., Ceken, C., Erdemli, Y., Internet of things technology applications of biomedical field (2016) Duzce University Journal of Science and Technology, 4, pp. 37-54; Ali, N.S., Carlton, K.H., Ali, O.S., Telehealth education in nursing curricula (2015) Nurse Educ., 13; Archibald, M.M., Barnard, A., Futurism in nursing: technology, robotics and the fundamentals of care (2017) J.

A dominant thought considers that economic growth should be based on capital accumulation, productivity improvement, and access to international markets. This article tracts the system of assumptions that developing countries should meet to ensure that transfer models from developed countries could be efficient. We suggest a rebuilding of the transfer model by identifying some “structuring” conditions of developing countries, in particular by empowering universities to take a central role in the regional development process. From a poverty reduction perspective, the focus should be on the sustainability of local socio-technical systems, even if the options chosen are less efficient in the short term. © 2019, © 2019 Global South Ltd.","developing countries; knowledge transfer; local development; Poverty; university",,,,,,"Alexander, A.T., Martin, D.P., Intermediaries for Open Innovation: A Competence-Based Comparison of Knowledge Transfer Offices Practices (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80 (1), pp. 38-49; Arregle, J.L., Miller, T.L., Hitt, M.A., Beamish, P.W., Do Regions Matter? an Integrated Institutional and Semiglobalization Perspective on the Internationalization of MNEs (2013) Strategic Management Journal, 34 (8), pp. 910-934; Arvanitis, S., Sydow, N., Woerter, M., Is There Any Impact of University-Industry Knowledge Transfer on Innovation and Productivity? an Empirical Analysis Based on Swiss Firm Data (2008) Review of Industrial Organization, 32 (2), pp. 77-94; Bair, J., Palpacuer, F., CSR beyond the Corporation: Contested Governance in Global Value Chains (2015) Global Networks, 15 (s1), pp. S1-S19; Bair, J., Werner, M., The Place of Disarticulations: Global Commodity Production in La Laguna, Mexico (2011) Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space, 43 (5), p. 998; Banerjee, A., Duflo, E., (2012) Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty, , New York: PublicAffairs; Banerjee, S.B., Voices of the Governed: Towards a Theory of the Translocal (2011) Organization, 18 (3), pp. 323-344; Barham, V., Boadway, R., Marchand, M., Pestieau, P., Education and the Poverty Trap (1995) European Economic Review, 39 (7), pp. 1257-1275; Benneworth, P., Charles, D., Madanipour, A., Building Localized Interactions between Universities and Cities through University Spatial Development (2010) European Planning Studies, 18 (10), pp. 1611-1629; Benneworth, P., Hospers, G.J., Urban Competitiveness in the Knowledge Economy: Universities as New Planning Animateurs (2007) Progress in Planning, 67 (2), p. 105; Berrone, P., Fosfuri, A., Gelabert, L., Gomez-Mejia, L.R., Necessity as the Mother of ‘Green’ Inventions: Institutional Pressures and Environmental Innovations (2013) Strategic Management Journal, 34 (8), pp. 891-909; Blustein, D.L., Kozan, S., Connors-Kellgren, A., Unemployment and Underemployment: A Narrative Analysis about Loss (2013) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 82 (3), pp. 256-265; Bouahom, B., Douangsavanh, L., Rigg, J., Building Sustainable Livelihoods in Laos: Untangling Farm from Non-Farm, Progress from Distress (2004) Geoforum, 35 (5), pp. 607-619; Lin, B.B., Resilience in Agriculture through Crop Diversification: Adaptive Management for Environmental Change (2011) BioScience, 61 (3), p. 183; Brown, P.H., Park, A., Education and Poverty in Rural China (2002) Economics of Education Review, 21 (6), pp. 523-541; Brundenius, C., Lundvall, B.Å., Sutz, J., “The Role of Universities in Innovation Systems in Developing Countries: Developmental University System–Empirical, Analytical and Normative Perspectives (2014) Handbook of Innovation Systems and Developing Countries: Building Domestic Capabilities in a Global Setting, pp. 311-333. , Lundvall B.Å., Joseph K.J., Chaminade C., Vang J., (eds), Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing Inc, and,.

Particularly in the context of vehicle autonomy, customer insights lay a significant foundation for strategic decision-making of organizations in the automotive industry. This paper outlines how a German car manufacturer explored customer needs in the context of highly automated vehicles (AVs).1 by implementing corporate foresight research with visionary customers and how the findings supported the strategic decision-making process of the firm. A qualitative pilot study with 29 visionary, trend-receiving customers from Germany, the USA and China identified three innovative use cases for premium highly AVs. A subsequent quantitative online survey with 733 participants from the same three markets confirms the relevance of the use cases for mainstream and innovative consumers. The findings underline that highly AVs are a game changer, transforming future cars into extended living and office spaces, with several implications for practitioners. The findings helped to adapt the organization's business model and branding strategy, provided valuable insights for follow-up studies and shaped corporate communication. The contribution of the paper is threefold: It introduces the concept of strategic customer foresight, outlines specifically how organizations can implement customer foresight research as well as how such research benefits the decision-making process of companies. Further, the paper discloses future customer needs in the context of premium highly AVs. © 2019","Autonomous driving; Corporate foresight; Customer foresight; Customer insights; Emergent nature consumers; Qualitative research; Radical innovation; Survey; Trend receiver","Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Decision making; Office buildings; Surveying; Surveys; Vehicles; Autonomous driving; Corporate foresight; Customer foresight; Customer insights; Emergent nature consumers; Qualitative research; Radical innovation; Sales; automation; automobile industry; corporate strategy; decision making; future prospect; innovation; qualitative analysis; research; survey method; trend analysis; China; Germany; United States",,,,,"Andriopoulos, C., Gotsi, M., Probing the future: mobilising foresight in multiple-product innovation firms (2006) Futures, 38 (1), pp. 50-66; Bansal, P., Kockelman, K.M., Singh, A., Assessing public opinions of and interest in new vehicle technologies: an Austin perspective (2016) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 67, pp. 1-14; Becker, F., Axhausen, K.W., Literature review on surveys investigating the acceptance of automated vehicles (2017) Transportation, 44 (6), pp. 1293-1306; Bernhart, W., Winterhoff, M., Autonomous driving: Disruptive innovation that promises to change the automotive industry as we know it (2016) Energy Consumption and Autonomous Driving.

However, this approach does not take into account numerous factors of change or disruption over a longer term (10 to 20, or even 50 years), although a decade or two are needed to effectively deal with the stakes of research. These stakes become more acute over the long term, as consequences of predicted changes (e. g. climate) or other factors such as pollution, biodiversity erosion, reduction of ecosystemic services... This complex question justifies turning to a foresight approach. Because it enables tipping points to be envisaged for some key variables of the system studied (in this case, the environment), the scenario method seems well adapted to proposing several contrasting visions of the future. The research question is: how a large screening of international studies on environmental scenarios can help framing the reflection on research priorities about environment? To help take its strategic reflection forward, in June 2015 the French national research alliance for the environment (AllEnvi) commissioned its transversal foresight group to identify the major families of scenarios described in foresight studies dealing with the environment since 2000. The summary of the 307 scenarios produced by analyzing 99 international studies highlighted 11 possible societal and environmental pathways. Analyzing these families of scenarios thus makes it easier to clarify the multiple roles that science can play, according to contrasting dynamics. Consequently, this study shows how a systematic review of foresight studies and their related visions of the future of environment can stimulate and enlighten the reflection on the ways societies can (re)define their future, by combining environmental, governance and social sciences.. © 2019","2100; Environment; Foresight; Research programming; Scenarios","Technological forecasting; 2100; Environment; Environmental pathways; Environmental science; Foresight; International studies; Scenarios; Scientific programming; Biodiversity; demography; research; France",,,,,"Adloff, F., Somot, S., Sevault, F., Jordà, G., Aznar, R., Déqué, M., Herrmann, M., Gomis, D., Mediterranean Sea response to climate change in an ensemble of twenty first century scenarios (2015) Clim.

We show that current ISO implementations that settle only the upcoming interval of the multi-interval solution can create incentive problems. Fundamentally, this is the result of each successive optimization problem treating historical losses as sunk costs. To solve the incentive issues, we present an existing proposal and a new multi-interval pricing method. Both methods incorporate historical losses and produce prices that appropriately incentivize generators to follow multi-interval dispatch instructions when implemented with a fixed finite horizon and perfect foresight. In practice, the fixed horizon requirement necessary for this result is not satisfied because new information about the future is constantly being revealed to the ISO as time proceeds. Realistic rolling horizon implementations for an ISO New England-based system suggest that the new method results in lower out-of-market payments than both current ISO implementations and the existing proposal. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","convex optimization; Electricity markets; look-ahead dispatch; multi-interval real-time markets; pricing","Commerce; Convex optimization; Electric utilities; Power markets; Dispatch instructions; Finite horizons; Independent system operators; look-ahead dispatch; Optimization problems; Perfect foresights; Real-time market; Rolling horizon; Costs",,,,,"Han, X.S., Gooi, H.B., Kirschen, D.S., Dynamic economic dispatch: Feasible and optimal solutions (2001) IEEE Trans.

To set their outputs, players adopt, alternatively, the best response rule having perfect foresight or an imitative rule. Players are allowed to change their behavior through an evolutionary mechanism according to which the rule with better performance will attract more followers. The relevant stationary state of the model describes a scenario where players produce at the Cournot-Nash level. Due to the presence of imitative behavior, we find that the number of players and implementation costs, needed to the best response exploitation, have an ambiguous role in determining the stability properties of the equilibrium and double stability thresholds can be observed. Differently, the role of the intensity of choice, representing the evolutionary propensity to switch to the most profitable rule, has a destabilizing role, in line with the common occurrence in evolutionary models. The global analysis of the model reveals that increasing values of the intensity of choice parameter determine increasing dynamic complexities for the internal attractor representing a population where both decision mechanisms coexist. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","dynamic instability; dynamical systems; evolutionary game; heterogeneity; imitation; replicator dynamics",,,,,,"Agiza, H., Elsadany, A., Nonlinear dynamics in the cournot duopoly game with heterogeneous players (2003) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 320, pp. 512-524; Agiza, H., Elsadany, A., Chaotic dynamics in nonlinear duopoly game with heterogeneous players (2004) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 149 (3), pp. 843-860; Agiza, H., Hegazi, A., Elsadany, A., Complex dynamics and synchronization of a duopoly game with bounded rationality (2002) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 58 (2), pp. 133-146; Andaluz, J., Elsadany, A., Jarne, G., Nonlinear cournot and bertrandtype dynamic triopoly with differentiated products and heterogeneous expectations (2017) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 132, pp. 86-99; Andaluz, J., Jarne, G., On the dynamics of economic games based on product differentiation (2015) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 113, pp. 16-27; Angelini, N., Dieci, R., Nardini, F., Bifurcation analysis of a dynamic duopoly model with heterogeneous costs and behavioural rules (2009) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 79 (10), pp. 3179-3196; Anufriev, M., Radi, D., Tramontana, F., Some reflections on past and future of nonlinear dynamics in economics and finance (2018) Decisions in Economics and Finance, 41 (2), pp. 91-118; Apesteguia, J., Huck, S., Oechssler, J., Imitation—Theory and experimental evidence (2007) Journal of Economic Theory, 136 (1), pp. 217-235; Apesteguia, J., Huck, S., Oechssler, J., Weidenholzer, S., Imitation and the evolution of Walrasian behavior: Theoretically fragile but behaviorally robust (2010) Journal of Economic Theory, 145 (5), pp. 1603-1617; Askar, S.S., The rise of complex phenomena in cournot duopoly games due to demand functions without inflection points (2014) Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 19 (6), pp. 1918-1925; Askar, S.S., Complex dynamic properties of cournot duopoly games with convex and log-concave demand function (2014) Operations Research Letters, 42 (1), pp. 85-90; Bigoni, M., Fort, M., Information and learning in oligopoly: An experiment (2013) Games and Economic Behavior, 81, pp. 192-214; Bischi, G.-I., Gallegati, M., Naimzada, A., Symmetry-breaking bifurcations and representativefirm in dynamic duopoly games (1999) Annals of Operations Research, 89, pp. 252-271; Bischi, G.I., Lamantia, F., Radi, D., An evolutionary cournot model with limited market knowledge (2015) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 116, pp. 219-238; Bischi, G.I., Naimzada, A., Global analysis of a dynamic duopoly game with bounded rationality (2000) Advances in dynamic ames and applications, pp. 361-385. , J.

Our seas and oceans represent 71% of earth's surface, yet its space and resources today are not sustainably utilised to their full extent. The importance of the use of the marine environment is within the EU widely acknowledged and reflected in such agendas as the EU Blue Growth strategy, the Food 2030 agenda and the Food from our Oceans vision. In order to substantiate the vision to increasingly feed the world population from our oceans, a foresight exercise was implemented to construct an agenda of the science needed in the realm of fisheries, aquaculture and seafood. This resulted in a research agenda that is logically argued and based on an analysis made by stakeholders and experts which led to the identification of priorities having a scientific analytical basis as well as a societal reference. The process and the results of this foresight exercise are presented and are put in the wider context of Europe's research agenda towards 2050. In order to bring about the required Blue Revolution, substantial effort should be rendered to the science and innovation needed to support this development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aquaculture; Fisheries; Food from our oceans; Research; Seafood processing","aquaculture; fishery; food processing; food supply; natural resource; research; seafood; stakeholder; sustainable development; Europe",,,,,"Béné, C., Arthur, R., Norbury, H., Allison, E.H., Beveridge, M., Bush, S., Campling, L., Squires, D., Contribution of fisheries and aquaculture to food security and poverty reduction: assessing the current evidence (2016) World Dev., 79, pp. 177-196; SAPEA, Food from the Oceans, How Can More Food and Biomass Be Obtained from the Oceans in a Way that does Not Deprive Future Generations of Their Benefits?

We take a systemic and synthesizing view of some of the (inter)disciplinary methods by which these futures are derived: climate and integrated assessment modeling, ‘deductive’ modes of social science inquiry, deliberative stakeholder engagement, and foresight-based scenarios. We speak to the epistemologies, objectives, and user communities surrounding these research practices, highlighting that different modes of constructing and interpreting evidence about an unformed future yield different kinds of results and signals for actions to be taken. We show how different methods for exploring ‘futures’ form an evolving history of how the risks of CE have been assessed (or constructed), and conclude by echoing calls for a stronger shared understanding of the practices and politics that underpin future-oriented research. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate engineering; Epistemology; Futures; Methodology; Research practice; Risk",,,,,,"Anderson, K., Duality in climate science (2015) Nat Geosci, 8, pp. 898-900; Beck, S., Mahony, M., The politics of anticipation: the IPCC and the negative emissions technologies experience (2018) Glob Sustain, 1, pp. 1-8; Bellamy, R., Healey, P., ‘Slippery slope’or ‘uphill struggle’?

Counter to disagreement, they may only believe an outcome that agrees with their belief to be more predictable in hindsight than foresight. The focus of this research is on the relationship between these biases. Students were queried about their dichotomous beliefs (learned vs. genetic) about behavior for an animal experiment and then assigned randomly to a no-outcome or genetic outcome condition. With agreement between students' belief and outcome, the findings revealed hindsight bias (foreseeability) supported by the outcomes for surprise, disappointment, ethics, and research evaluation. With disagreement, hindsight bias was trumped along with perceiving the experiment as being less ethical and scientifically sound. Regardless of the outcome, students seem to adhere to their beliefs. Hence, students may believe that the outcome is inconsequential because it is obvious or contrary to their beliefs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Ethics; hindsight bias; prior beliefs; research evaluation; teaching instruction","article; controlled study; ethics; hindsight bias; human; human experiment; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial; sound; student; teaching",,,,,"Blank, H., Nestler, S., von Collani, G., Fischer, V., How many hindsight biases are there (2008) Cognition, 106, pp. 1408-1440. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2007.07.007; Fischhoff, B., Hindsight ≠ foresight: The effect of outcome knowledge on judgment under uncertainty (1975) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 1 (3), pp. 288-299. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.1.3.288, 104); Greenhoot, A.F., Semb, G., Colombo, J., Schreiber, T., Prior beliefs and methodological concepts in scientific reasoning (2004) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 18, pp. 203-221. , https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.959; Harley, E.M., Hindsight bias in legal decision making (2007) Social Cognition, 25, pp. 48-63. , https://doi.org/10.1521/soco.2007.25.1.48; Herzog, H.A., Discussing animal rights and animal research in the classroom (1990) Teaching of Psychology, 17, pp. 90-94. , https://doi.org/10.1207/s15328023top1702_3; Hom, H.L., Jr., Kaiser, D.L., Role of hindsight bias, ethics, and self-other judgments in students' evaluation of an animal experiment (2016) Ethics & Behavior, 26, pp. 1-13; Klaczynski, P.A., Motivated scientific reasoning bias, epistemological beliefs, and theory polarization: A two process approach to adolescent cognition (2000) Child Development, 71, pp. 1347-1366. , https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8624.00232; Klaczynski, P.A., Gordon, P.A., Faust, J., Goal-oriented critical reasoning and individual differences in critical reasoning biases (1997) Journal of Educational Psychology, 89, pp. 470-485. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.89.3.470; Lord, C.G., Ross, L., Lepper, M.R., Biased assimilation and attitude polarization (1979) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37, pp. 2098-2109. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.37.11.2098; Louie, T.A., Decision makers' hindsight bias after receiving favorable and unfavorable feedback (1999) Journal of Applied Psychology, 84, pp. 29-41. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.84.1.29; Louie, T.A., Hindsight bias and outcome-consistent thoughts when observing and making service provider decisions (2005) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 98, pp. 88-95. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2005.03.004; Louie, T.A., Curren, M.T., Harich, K.R., “I knew we would win”: Hindsight bias for favorable and unfavorable team decision outcomes (2000) Journal of Applied Psychology, 85, pp. 264-272. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.85.2.264; Mark, M.M., Boburka, R.B., Eyssell, K.M., Cohen, L.L., Mellor, S., “I couldn't have seen it coming”: The impact of negative self-relevant outcomes on retrospections about foreseeability (2003) Memory, 11, pp. 443-454. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09658210244000522; Mark, M.M., Mellor, S., Effect of self-relevance of an event on hindsight bias: The foreseeability of a layoff (1991) Journal of Applied Psychology, 76, pp. 569-577. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.76.4.569; Masnick, A.M., Zimmerman, C., Evaluating scientific research in the context of prior belief: Hindsight bias or confirmation bias?

The rationale behind this method is to give values to stochastic movements as well as to accept unvalued solutions during the investigation of search spaces. SQWALKING incorporates simulated quenching and forward selection methods to choose the models through the ensemble using probabilistic steps. Two versions of SQWALKING are introduced based on two different evaluation measures; SQWALKINGA that is based on an accuracy measure and SQWALKINGH that is based on a human-like foresight measure. The main objective is to construct a proper architecture of ensemble pruning, which is independent of ensemble construction and combination phases. Extensive comparisons between the proposed method and competitors in terms of heterogeneous and homogeneous ensembles are performed using ten datasets. The comparisons on the heterogeneous ensemble show that SQWALKINGH and SQWALKINGA can lead respectively to 5.13% and 4.22% average accuracy improvement. One reason for these promising results is the pruning phase that takes additional time to find the best models compared to rivals. Finally, the proposed SQWALKINGs are also evaluated on a real-world dataset. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ensemble pruning method; Forward selection method; Genetic algorithm; Simulated annealing algorithm; Simulated quenching algorithm","Genetic algorithms; Quenching; Simulated annealing; Accuracy Improvement; Ensemble construction; Ensemble pruning; Evaluation measures; Forward selection; Heterogeneous ensembles; Simulated annealing algorithms; Simulated Quenching; Stochastic systems",,,,,"Kuncheva, L.I., (2004) Combining pattern classifiers, methods and algorithms, , Wiley, Hoboken; Tan, P.N., Steinbach, M., Kumar, V., (2006) Introduction to Data Mining, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc, Boston; Dietterich, T.G., (2000) Ensemble methods in machine learning, , Springer, Berlin; Prodromidis, A., Chan, P., Meta-learning in distributed data mining systems: issues and approaches (2000) Advances of distributed data mining, , AAAI Press, Palo Alto; Caruana, R., Ensemble selection from libraries of models (2004) Proceedings of the 21St International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 137-144. , ACM: Banff, Canada; Margineantu, D., Dietterich, T., Pruning adaptive boosting (1997) Proceedings of the 14Th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 211-218. , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc; Zhou, Z.H., Wu, J., Tang, W., Ensemble neural networks: many could be better than all (2002) Artif Intell, 137 (1-2), pp. 239-263; Ekbal, A., Saha, S., A multiobjective simulated annealing approach for classifier ensemble: named entity recognition in Indian languages as case studies (2011) Expert Syst Appl, 38 (12), pp. 14760-14772; Ekbal, A., Saha, S., Weighted vote-based classifier ensemble for named entity recognition: a genetic algorithm-based approach (2011) ACM Trans Asian Lang Inf Process, 10 (2), pp. 1-37; Ekbal, A., Saha, S., Simulated annealing based classifier ensemble techniques: application to part of speech tagging (2013) Inf Fusion, 14 (3), pp. 288-300; Saha, S., Ekbal, A., Combining multiple classifiers using vote based classifier ensemble technique for named entity recognition (2013) Data Knowl Eng, 85, pp. 15-39; Deb, K., (2001) Multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms, p. 518. , Wiley, Hoboken; Banfield, R.E., Ensemble diversity measures and their application to thinning (2005) Inf Fusion, 6 (1), pp. 49-62; Partalas, I., Tsoumakas, G., Vlahavas, I., An ensemble uncertainty aware measure for directed hill climbing ensemble pruning (2010) Mach Learn, 81 (3), pp. 257-282; Taghavi, Z.S., Sajedi, H., Human-inspired ensemble pruning using hill climbing algorithm (2013) The 5Th Robocup Iranopen International Symposium and the 3Rd Joint Conference of Robotices and AI, pp. 1-7. , IEEE: Qazvin-Iran; Taghavi, Z.S., Sajedi, H., Ensemble selection using simulated annealing walking (2014) The Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computing, Electronics and Electrical Technology.

First, it presents the methodology including ten characteristics for scenario assessment: modelling framework (diversity), ambitiousness of the targets 2050, relations with other (European)countries, stakeholder involvement, technology options, non-technological aspects, economic component, usage of scenarios in policy design, intermediate indicators of targets' achievement and revision of scenarios. Further, it uses qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate energy scenarios developed in six north-west European countries (the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark, the UK, Belgium). Finally, conclusions are made concerning the possible ways of scenario design improvement. The analysis has shown that all selected countries have potential for modifying their energy scenarios, which being implemented may help to achieve the joint European targets 2050. Since these countries are socially and economically interrelated, a more harmonised approach to scenario development is needed to be designed and introduced on the EU level. Ten characteristics proposed in this study may serve as an initial input for such harmonisation. The results can be of interest to economists, business and academic representatives, and especially policy makers involved in the long-term energy scenario development on the international, regional and national level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy policy; Foresight; Low-carbon energy scenarios; North-west European countries; Technology trends; The European targets 2050","Binary alloys; Energy policy; Potassium alloys; European Countries; Foresight; Low carbon energies; Technology trends; The European targets 2050; Carbon; carbon; energy policy; future prospect; scenario analysis; technological development; trend analysis; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Netherlands; United Kingdom",,,,,"Benders, R., Moll, H., Noorman, K.J., Wiersma, G., CO2 reduction strategies for the Northern Netherlands (2011) J.

A two-round online Delphi study with 15 international experts in the field of CCU enabled us to explore the main items within five impact categories: (1) benefits, (2) risks, (3) future developments, (4) demand, and (5) supply constraints. Based on the results of the Delphi study, we constructed 4 future scenarios that represent how the CCU sector could develop within 10 years, using a local scenario development workshop with 9 experts from within Flanders (Belgium) and the Netherlands. We used a deductive, explorative scenario development method, which resulted in a two-by-two scenario matrix. We find that the local experts consider the role of the government and the development of CCU costs to be the most uncertain factors and could have the highest impact on the development of the sector within the next 10 years. Our insights can be instructive for facilitating the process of scenario planning for CCU development activities. Finally, although we work with a regionally specific case study, the same method could be implemented in other regions, using the general findings from our Delphi study as a starting point for the scenario development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CCU; CDU; Delphi method; Futures study; Scenario development; Technological foresight","Economics; Natural resources management; Waste management; Delphi method; Development activity; Futures study; International experts; Scenario development; Supply constraints; Technological foresight; Uncertain factors; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; Delphi analysis; future prospect; planning practice; scenario analysis; technology adoption; Article; carbon capture and utilization; carbon footprint; cost; Delphi study; Flanders; government; Netherlands; online system; organization and management; policy; qualitative research; recycling; Belgium; Flanders; Netherlands",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,"Abanades, J.C., On the climate change mitigation potential of CO2 conversion to fuels (2017) Energy Environ.

Yet, personalized medicine in the 21st century is far from being ""future-proof."" Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and changing human values and preferences, call for anticipatory, rather than reactive, approaches to the governance of precision medicine futures. In this context, anticipatory governance is an innovative approach to understanding technology and innovation futures. Anticipatory governance and its corollary anticipatory ethics on emerging technologies require interdisciplinary collaboration and communication to cultivate shared language, imagination, and orientation toward plausible sociotechnical innovation trajectories. This study reports, for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge, an anticipatory governance experiment on ""implementation precision medicine (IPM)"" using scenario analysis and design fiction. Participants were undergraduate students and experts who collaboratively imagined the plausible futures of precision medicine. Given the long history of the precision medicine field, and recent calls for translating big data to real-life clinical applications, implementation was chosen as a key focus area of precision medicine futures. We report here several plausible future innovation scenarios of interest to precision medicine scientists and engineers and researchers in the fields of emerging technology governance, responsible innovation, and social studies of science. Of importance, we found that the playful quality of the design fiction methodology and the pedagogical orientation facilitated by undergraduate student involvement created an engaging creative safe space to build transdisciplinary dialog examining the social and anticipatory ethics dimensions of IPM. Demonstrating the possibilities of such cross-disciplinary dialog and differential expertise, this article is conceptualized and coauthored by all participants further attesting to the importance of co-designing and co-imagining innovation futures in IPM. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","anticipatory ethics; anticipatory governance; design fiction; implementation precision medicine; scenario analysis; technology foresight",,,,,,"Alyass, A., Turcotte, M., Meyre, D., From big data analysis to personalized medicine for all: Challenges and opportunities (2015) BMC Med Genomics, 8, p. 33; Barben, D., Fisher, E., Selin, C., Guston, D.H., Anticipatory governance of nanotechnology: Foresight, engagement, and integration (2008) The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies, pp. 979-1000. , Hackett EJ, Amsterdamska O, Lynch M, and Wajcman J, eds.

Approach: After providing a brief history of evidence synthesis, this article describes why reporting standards are important, summarizes the sequential steps involved in conducting SRs and meta-analyses, and outlines additional methodological issues that researchers should address when conducting and reporting results from their SRs. Results and conclusions: Successful SRs result when teams of reviewers with appropriate expertise use the highest scientific rigor in all steps of the SR process. Thus, SRs that lack foresight are unlikely to prove successful. We advocate that SR teams consider potential moderators (M) when defining their research problem, along with Time, Outcomes, Population, Intervention, Context, and Study design (i.e., TOPICS + M). We also show that, because the PRISMA reporting standards only partially overlap dimensions of methodological quality, it is possible for SRs to satisfy PRISMA standards yet still have poor methodological quality. As well, we discuss limitations of such standards and instruments in the face of the assumptions of the SR process, including meta-analysis spanning the other SR steps, which are highly synergistic: Study search and selection, coding of study characteristics and effects, analysis, interpretation, reporting, and finally, re-analysis and criticism. When a SR targets an important question with the best possible SR methods, its results can become a definitive statement that guides future research and policy decisions for years to come. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Evidence synthesis; Meta-analysis; Methodological quality; Research synthesis; Risk of bias; Systematic reviews","academic research; best management practice; future prospect; health geography; literature review; meta-analysis; research work; risk assessment; clinical outcome; clinical research; good clinical practice; health care policy; health science; human; methodology; population research; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; quality control; research; Review; sampling; standard; study design; systematic review",,,,,"Balshem, H., Helfand, M., Schünemann, H.J., Oxman, A.D., Kunz, R., Brozek, J., Vist, G.E., Norris, S., Grade guidelines: 3.

Each utilisation pathway has its own environmental and economic burdens and benefits, which may also change overtime due to market demand, policy change and local environmental conditions. In this study, an optimisation framework is introduced to identify the optimal allocation of resources based on life cycle perspective. The problem is broken into a series of multi-objective linear programs to account for potential non-linearity in the objective functions and constraints. First, life cycle costing analysis and environmental life cycle assessment were conducted to quantify the environmental and economic values of each decision variable. The values were used to construct economic and environmental objective functions. Then, normalisation procedures were followed to convert the two objective functions into a single objective function. The model was applied to the case of logs generated from the second thinning of the hardwood plantations in Australia. Eight utilisation scenarios were considered, including two engineered wood products and six bioenergy applications. The costs of the displaced products by the alternatives were included as avoided costs in line with the LCA scope. The model was solved in six time periods (ten years each). The robustness of the solution was tested by assigning different weightings to the environmental and economic objectives. The result showed that Woodchips Gasification (WCG) for electricity and heat production was the dominating solution for the first period with 85% of the logs allocated to this option. Nevertheless, the quantities allocated to energy production declined progressively over the subsequent periods. The laminated veneer lumber (LVL) option surpassed the WCG and became more dominant option starting from the fourth period. In the final period, 100% of thinned logs were allocated to the LVL option due to the predicted increased demand. The developed framework offers forestry managements the foresight to enhance their long-term environmental and economic performance through strategic multi-period optimisation approach, thus avoiding the technology lock-in and allowing flexibility in the system to adapt to future changes. Although this model was demonstrated using the forestry industry case, the framework can be applied to any resource allocation problem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle cost (LCC); Linear programming (LP); Multi-objective optimisation (MOO); Multi-period","Building materials; Costs; Economics; Energy conversion; Environmental technology; Forestry; Hardwoods; Highway bridges; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Resource allocation; Timber; Wood products; Environmental and economic performance; Environmental life cycle assessment; Environmental objectives; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing analysis; Life cycle costs (LCC); Multi-period; Resource allocation problem; Life cycle",,,,,"Life Cycle Costing: an Application Guide (2014), AS/NZS 4536:1999 R2014, Standards Association of Australia Homebush/Wellington: Australian/New Zealand Standard; http://alcas.asn.au/AusLCI/, Auslci. 2011.

Rovisco Pais, Lisbon, 1049-001, Portugal","Background: Health inequalities have been consistently reported across and within European countries and continue to pose major challenges to policy-making. The development of scenarios regarding what could affect population health (PH) inequalities across Europe in the future is considered critical. Scenarios can help policy-makers prepare and better cope with fast evolving challenges. Objective: This paper describes the three 2030 time-horizon scenarios developed under the EURO-HEALTHY project, depicting the key factors that may affect the evolution of PH inequalities across European regions. Methods: A three-stage socio-technical approach was applied: i) identification of drivers (key factors expected to affect the evolution of PH inequalities across European regions until 2030) - this stage engaged in a Web-Delphi process a multidisciplinary panel of 51 experts and other stakeholders representing the different perspectives regarding PH inequalities; ii) generation of scenario structures - different drivers' configurations (i.e. their hypotheses for evolution) were organized into coherent scenario structures using the Extreme-World Method; and iii) validation of scenario structures and generation of scenario narratives. Stages ii) and iii) were conducted in two workshops with a strategic group of 13 experts with a wide view about PH inequalities. The scenario narratives were elaborated with the participants' insights from both the Web-Delphi process and the two workshops, together with the use of evidence (both current and future-oriented) on the different areas within the PH domain. Results: Three scenarios were developed for the evolution of PH inequalities in Europe until 2030: 'Failing Europe' (worst-case but plausible picture of the future), 'Sustainable Prosperity' (best-case but plausible picture of the future), and an interim scenario 'Being Stuck' depicting a 'to the best of our knowledge' evolution. These scenarios show the extent to which a combination of Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental drivers shape future health inequalities, providing information for European policy-makers to reflect upon whether and how to design robust policy solutions to tackle PH inequalities. Conclusions: The EURO-HEALTHY scenarios were designed to inform both policy design and appraisal. They broaden the scope, create awareness and generate insights regarding the evolution of PH inequalities across European regions. © 2019 The Author(s).","Delphi method; Foresight; Health inequalities; Participatory approach; Policies; Population Health; Scenarios; Socio-technical approach; Stakeholders","adult; article; awareness; Delphi study; driver; Europe; female; human; major clinical study; male; narrative; population health; validation process",,,,,"(2013) Health Inequalities in the EU-Final Report of A Consortium.

Using empirical data informed by a practice theory lens, we expand the understanding of flexibility with regard to work by augmenting how worker disposition, as well as the ability to engage with agility in dynamic circumstances, should be considered as a factor when examining and designing for this population. We make several contributions of interest to the wider CSCW community. First, we distinguish between those who showcase flexible practices and those who proactively orient around flexibility. We call this second group ‘elastic workers’. Second, we raise new questions for us as scholars and designers keen to exploit the conceptual and pragmatic intersection of technology and work. These questions create opportunities to explore different methods for understanding complex phenomena such as flexibility, as well as understanding how we might design for this phenomenon with more foresight in the future. © 2019, The Author(s).","Elastic; Flexible work; Future of work; Infrastructure; Knowledge work; Practice; Worker","Computer applications; Computer science; Computer supported cooperative work; Elastic; Flexible work; Future of works; Infrastructure; Knowledge work; Practice; Worker; Population statistics",,,,,"Alkhatib, A.S., Bernsteinlevi, M., Examining Crowd Work and Gig Work Through The Historical Lens of Piecework (2017) CHI ’17.

In Central Kalimantan Province, only 1.5 million ha (57%) of the total 2.6 million ha peatland is categorized as pristine peatlands forest and the remaining 1.1 million ha is categorized as degraded. Degraded peatland is a significant source of CO2 emissions as well as one such alternative for agricultural expansion. There is scientifically unfounded belief that drained peatland agriculture can be made “long-term sustainable”; therefore, the main idea is only short-term utilization of degraded peatlands for agriculture in a relatively sustainable manner, while effort for conservation and reforestation for long-term sustainable keeps going on. Prospective structural analysis was used to identify the most influential and sensitive variables to be influenced for determining the locally most crucial areas of improvement for enabling short-term agricultural utilization of degraded peatlands in a relatively sustainable manner. This method is a part of strategic foresight toolbox for scenario building process, which observes interrelation and influence among different variables in order to understand the most relevant factors for the development of a specific area. Based on the analysis, the strategies considered for enabling short-term agricultural utilization of degraded peatlands in a relatively sustainable manner include improvement in soil fertility and suitability for agriculture, infrastructure related to peatlands agriculture, institutional capacity, innovation technology and dissemination, farmer knowledge in sustainable peatlands agriculture, and plant productivity. Agricultural expansion implemented in connection with these improvements would enhance the welfare of farmers as well as maintain ecological systems. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Degraded peatland; Morphology analysis; Prospective structural analysis; Sustainable agriculture","alternative agriculture; conservation status; land degradation; management practice; peatland; reforestation; smallholder; soil fertility; strategic approach; sustainability; Central Kalimantan; Indonesia",,,,,"Adriani, T.A., Wihardjaka, A., Setyantosalwati, P., Pengaruh Pemberian Amelioran pada Perkebunan Kelapa Sawit Di Lahan Gambut Provinsi Jambi Terhadap Emisi CO 2 (Effect of Ameliorant Application on CO 2 Emission from Peatland Oil Palm in Jambi) (2014) Prosiding Seminar Nasional Pengelolaan Berkelanjutan Lahan Gambut Terdegradasi Untuk Mitigasi GRK Dan Peningkatan Nilai Ekonomi Proceeding National Seminar” Research for Sustainable Degraded Peatland Management to Green House Gas Emission Mitigation and Improve Economic value”.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss how we can construct immersive spatial narratives through multimedia-enhanced learning approaches, to increase deeper learner immersion and levels of creativity to transport the learner into a simulated 2030 landscape by reducing the distance between the projected reality and the Self. Design/methodology/approach: The author designed a foresight-based course on the Future of Mobile Learning underpinned by a new learning system that embraced the concept of immersive spatial narratives, combining physical, virtual and cognitive learning spaces, which enable students to explore complex, undiscovered or unstructured knowledge. Practicing was carried out on 35 students who had completed the course during the preceding three years through a questionnaire and interviews to establish increased levels of creativity in a simulated future landscape. Findings: The paper established that the addition of multimedia learning environments and tools to foresight-based learning creates immersive spatial narratives that increase creativity and learner ability to project him/herself into a simulated future landscape. In all, 75 per cent of the respondents stated that having to think about the future and place themselves in a practicing landscape increased their creative skills. Originality/value: A new, foresight-based learning system driven by the concept of immersive spatial narratives, enhanced with student-created multimedia learning tools. The system demonstrated how this approach helps to increase learner creativity and the ability to transition from their Present Self to their Future Self. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Foresight-based learning; From Present Self to Future Self; Immersive spatial narratives; Increasing learner creativity; Multimedia-enhanced learning environments and tools; Thinking and creating in simulated future landscapes",,,,,,"Al-Huneidi, A., Schreurs, J., Constructivism based blended learning in higher education (2012) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET), 7 (1); Ansell-Pearson, K., The reality of the virtual: Bergson and deleuze (2005) MLN, 120 (5), pp. 1112-1127; Chirico, A., Yaden, D., Riva, G., Gaggioli, A., The potential of virtual reality for the investigation of awe (2016) Frontiers in Psychology, p. 7; Dalgarno, B., Lee, M., What are the learning affordances of 3-D virtual environments?

Since this project is expected to consume more than RM 4 billion, it is vital to do technology foresight to identify the emerging technologies which can be integrated to the VLE system. Besides, the emerging technologies must also be ranked accordingly so that the government can be made aware from the most practical technologies to the least for future study or procurement processes. This will indirectly help to identify technologies which are becoming obsolete or not relevant in the digital education field. This will certainly help the government to budget wisely and avoid any wastage or ill-spending. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Delphi-ranking method; emerging technologies; Virtual Learning Classroom (VLC) 1BestariNet; Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)","Budget control; Computer aided instruction; Computer vision; Engineering education; Machine learning; Education field; Emerging technologies; Primary and secondary education; Procurement process; Ranking methods; Technology foresight; Virtual learning; Virtual learning environments; E-learning",,,,,"Viriyapong, R., Harfield, A., Facing the challenges of the One-Tablet-Per-Child policy in Thai primary school education (2013) Int.

While extant research has focused on mature platforms, the authors know less about the early phases in a platform’s life cycle. Drawing inspiration from the effectual perspective on entrepreneurship, the purpose of this paper is to further the understanding of how software platforms are established. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a framework that describes four types of entrepreneurial awareness and then apply it to a qualitative case study of a platform that has emerged from the initial “creation” phase and is now in a period of rapid growth. Findings: The study indicates that successful establishment of a software platform depends upon the provider’s ability to integrate business acumen with technical proficiency and leverage these combined skills to ensure short-term viability and long-term relevance in the market. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to literature on platform strategy, which has previously focused on mature platforms, by addressing entrepreneurial behavior during a software platform’s establishment. As it is based on a single qualitative study, additional studies of different platforms are needed to verify the results. Originality/value: The paper highlights the dependence of software platform establishment on the ability to enact both explorative and exploitative activity patterns, and embrace both strategic foresight and systemic insight cognitive patterns. The combined patterns of activity and cognition form four types of awareness, pertaining to markets, resources, technology and contexts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business value of IT; Case study; Skills; Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)",,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Editors’ introduction (2003) Handbook of Entrepreneurship Research: An Interdisciplinary Survey and Introduction, pp. 3-20. , Acs, Z.J. and Audretsch, D.B. and,(Eds), Springer, Heidelberg; Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value creation in innovation ecosystems: how the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, 31 (3), pp. 306-333; Adner, R., Levinthal, D., Doing versus seeing: acts of exploitation and perceptions of exploration (2008) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 2 (1), pp. 43-52; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Discovery and creation: alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1 (1-2), pp. 11-26; Anderson, P., Tushman, M.L., Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: a cyclical model of technological change (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (4), pp. 604-633; Baldwin, C.Y., Woodard, C.J., The architecture of platforms: a unified view (2009) Platforms, Markets and Innovation, pp. 19-44. , Gawer, A.

Organizations, innovators, and changemakers alike are turning to the genre to navigate the future and design for the present, often unaware that generating and using images of the future for strategic purposes is a cornerstone of foresight practice. A fundamental concept in science fiction that is fueling the use of the genre as a strategic tool is worldbuilding. This paper explores how worldbuilding is currently leveraged, how it relates to design and foresight, and how it might further enrich both disciplines. It will propose that design and foresight may benefit from the worldbuilding processes of science fiction authors to design for coherence, user-test worlds, and help society develop a superstructure of culture in order to imagine and create new visions of the future. © 2019 Tamkang University.","Design; Science fiction; Social foresight; Worldbuilding",,,,,,"Anders, C.J., (2013) 7 deadly sins of worldbuilding, , http://io9.gizmodo.com/7-deadly-sins-of-worldbuilding-998817537, (August 2)Gizmodo; Bassett, C., Steinmueller, E., Voss, G., (2013) Better Made Up: The Mutual Influence of Science fiction and Innovation, , https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/better_made_up_the_mutual_influence:of_science:fiction_and_innovation.pdf, Nesta Working Paper No. 13/07; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: An overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Bradbury, R., (1984) The Toynbee convector, , https://kwarc.info/teaching/TDM/Bradbury.pdf, (January)Playboy; Brown, A.M., Imarisha, W., (2015) Octavia's brood: The project, , http://octaviasbrood.com/index.php?page=the-project; Candy, S., (2010) The futures of everyday life: Politics and the design of experiential scenarios (PhD Dissertation), , Department of Political Science, University of Hawaii at Manoa; Candy, S., (2015) La Chose du Futur à Paris [Blog post], , https://futuryst.blogspot.com/2015/11/la-chose-du-futur-paris.html, (November 2)The Sceptical Futuryst; Candy, S., Gaming futures literacy: The thing from the future (2018) Transforming the future: Anticipation in the 21st century, , In R.

Data are constructed from scratch in order to account for features of the transition economy and for delays in implementing legislated government spending and tax changes (fiscal foresight). For monetary policy, we find no price puzzles in the combined SVAR. Also, fiscal foresight variables have no statistically significant effects. We calculate an initial government spending multiplier of 0.70, which later peaks at 1.61 for the cumulative multiplier. This multiplier is much larger than multipliers estimated in previous studies not combining fiscal and monetary policy, where they were found to be close to zero. On the other hand, the tax multiplier is generally near zero in our study. We demonstrate the importance of combining fiscal and monetary transmission mechanisms when assessing the effects of government macroeconomic policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fiscal and monetary policy; Fiscal foresight; Structural vector autoregressions; Transition economy",,,,,,"Anzuini, A., Levy, A., Monetary policy shocks in the new EU members: a VAR approach (2007) Appl.

In these two respects, it stands beside and apart from the mode of veridiction proper to a parabiopolitics, which is scenaristic and grounded in a sophiology. I extract the lineaments of parabiopolitical reason from two sources. One is an exercise undertaken in Greece between 2002 and 2004 under the mandate of the European program, FORESIGHT.

It offers a systematic model to integrate the communication process used in human-centered design (i.e. the Generic Design Process) with concepts found in participatory normative futures studies and foresight practices. It is based on the understanding that design and foresight methodology have been converging for some time now, and acknowledges the branch in futures studies that has been employing creative approaches often to work on societal issues.

In addition to methods for producing foresight knowledge, tools are needed to make sense of the increasing amounts of future-oriented argumentation. This article presents a comparative analysis of anticipatory argumentation in two fields: the EU data protection reform and the Finnish concept for comprehensive security. A three-layer heuristic framework is presented for qualitative analysis of statements on plausible futures. The first layer consists of specific expectations regarding the future. The second layer is the generic anticipatory storyline. The third layer consists of the underlying futures consciousness. The data protection case presents an institutional reform narrative with short time perspective and relatively high agency, while the comprehensive security case presents a crisis narrative based on a contingency planning orientation with long time perspective, relatively developed systems perception and relatively low agency. In policy foresight with high uncertainty and high aspirations of agency, reflexivity and ethical responsibility are crucial components of foresight. This article promotes these by providing a tool for structuring anticipatory assumptions. The tool can be used for studying policy documents or during the policy process to craft more rigorous future-oriented policies. © 2019 The Author","Anticipation; Comprehensive security; Data protection; Future orientation; Futures consciousness; Reflexivity","Data privacy; Technological forecasting; Anticipation; Comprehensive security; Future orientations; Futures consciousness; Reflexivity; Security of data; data interpretation; future prospect; policy making; technological change; technological development",,,,,"Ahvenharju, S., Minkkinen, M., Lalot, F., The five dimensions of futures consciousness (2018) Futures, 104, pp. 1-13; Amanatidou, E., Beyond the veil — the real value of foresight (2014) Technol.

Based on interviews with technology entrepreneurs in Ghana, we developed a three-phase dynamic process model that demonstrates how institutional factors interact with firm-specific factors to influence entrepreneurial development. We identified constraints such as lack of access to financial credit, inadequate infrastructure, and human capital and resource constraints in Phase I, followed by formulating post-formation strategy in Phase II. Phase III focused on strategies for overcoming the constraints through innovations, leveraging new technologies and different financing models to outwit incumbents. The implications of the analysis for the sector and promising opportunities for future research are also outlined. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Africa; Foresight; Ghana; Innovation management; National innovation systems; New technology ventures","Technological forecasting; Africa; Foresight; Ghana; Innovation management; National innovation systems; New technology venture; entrepreneur; innovation; joint venture; technological development; Ghana",,,,,"Acquaah, M., Managerial social capital, strategic orientation, and organizational performance in an emerging economy (2007) Strateg.

Taiwan has started to enter a critical stage in developing a more environmentally-minded and futures-oriented worldview. While related prior research mostly emphasizes macro-level institutional change, this study focuses on evaluating the possibilities for encouraging sustainability-consciousness among young citizens through higher education. Students of the course ""Environmental Changes and Sustainable Futures"" were the participants in a quasi-experimental research design with pre- and post-measurements, and using participatory learning, reflective journals, and scenario workshops as the tools of pedagogical intervention. The results suggest that through a process of integrative learning, a culture of forward-thinking and visioning for sustainable alternative futures is emerging. Most importantly, student participants show promise as potential change agents for creating alternative environmental values and sustainable behaviors. © 2019 Tamkang University.","Curriculum design; Environmental values; Images of the future; Integrated scenarios; Sustainability",,,,,,"Brody, C., Differences by sex in support for nuclear power (1984) Social Forces, 63 (1), pp. 209-228; Burroughs, D., (2015) Men and women divided on nuclear power, , https://morningconsult.com/2015/05/24/men-and-women-divided-on-nuclear-power/, (May 24)Morning Consult; Chen, K.H., Linking metaphors of the future with socio-cultural prospects among Taiwanese high school students (2016) Futures, 84, pp. 178-185; Chen, K.H., Hoffman, J., Serious play: Transforming futures thinking through gamebased curriculum design (2017) Journal of Futures Studies, 22 (2), pp. 41-60; Dalton, R.J., Welzel, C., Political culture and value change (2014) The civic culture transformed: From allegiant to assertive citizens, pp. 1-16. , In R.

Futures and design are well suited to working together 'en route' to a society where creative processes activate collective imagination with a keen awareness that multiple futures are possible. This article draws on the author's interdisciplinary practice to examine what the collaboration between futures and media, art and design (MAD) has to offer and what makes it possible. It suggests that we recognise the interdisciplinary (polyamorous) nature of futures, that we get close to pool resources, that we use media-rich approaches for their ability to shape images of the futures and for co-creation with people outside of our fields. It lists lessons learned from a sample of three projects and indicates do's and don'ts that futurists can keep in mind for making the most of the collaborations and relationships that form at the intersection between futures and design. © 2019 Tamkang University.","Arts and design; Co-creation; Collaboration; Images of the futures; Media; Social foresight",,,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Evaluation and organization of futures research methodology-v3.0 (2009) Futures research methodology-Version 3.0, , https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e715/fd10fd25773939b-863f634cb4521c3f45367.pdf, In J.

Despite this criticism, other texts, including Denham’s revised (1653/5) edition of the poem, subsequently adapted the stag-hunt episode to commemorate Charles’s own trial and execution. The false presentation of the 1653/5 Coopers Hill as an edition that prints an original, authentic version of the poem from 1640 draws on the Virgilian technique of retrospective prophecy to make its status as a commentary on Charles’s execution more explicit. Denham repeated this technique in The Destruction of Troy (1656), which heavily revised an excerpt from his 1630s manuscript translation of Aeneid II–VI, and asserts the composition date of this earlier version in order to ‘foretell’ Charles’s execution. Analysing these Virgilian post eventum prophecies shows how both texts simultaneously censure and mourn Charles I, and also identifies increasingly self-recriminatory elements to Denham’s own royalism. © 2017, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Calvert, I.; Department of English, University of Bristol, 3/5 Woodland Road, Clifton, United Kingdom; email: egicc@bristol.ac.uk",,,"Springer Netherlands",,,,,10730508,,,,"English","Int.

A novel approach to simulate a time-adaptive intra-day photovoltaic forecast, solely based on an exponential smoothing of deviations between realized and forecast values, is presented. Generation uncertainty is then incorporated by numerous multi-stage scenario trees that account for a decreasing forecast error over time. Results show that total system costs significantly increase when uncertainty of both wind and photovoltaic generation is included by a single forecast, with more frequent starting processes of flexible plants and rather inflexible power plants mainly deployed at part-load. Including the improvement of both wind and photovoltaic forecasts by a scenario tree of possible manifestations, the scheduling costs could be significantly reduced in representative weeks for spring and summer. In general, stochastic representations increase the need for congestion management as well as more frequent use of storage in the model, leading to a more realistic depiction of the markets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity system modeling; Flexibility; Forecast error simulation; Photovoltaic; Stochasticity; Unit commitment","Commerce; Decision trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Stochastic models; Electricity system; Flexibility; Forecast errors; Photovoltaic; Stochasticity; Unit-commitment; Stochastic systems; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; photovoltaic system; power generation; power plant; simulation; spring (season); stochasticity; summer; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2012/12-Thesen/Agora_12_Insights_on_Germanys_Energiewende_web.pdf, Agora Energiewende, February 2013. 12 Insights on Germany's Energiewende – a discussion paper exploring key challenges for the power sector.

The challenge we must face together is the challenge of promoting freedom from disease and enabling all humans to flourish. The paper examines how the goals of the new public health might be better realised through consideration of the ‘corporate determinants of health’. It is argued that in order to meaningfully engage with the challenge posed by TNCs in oral health we have to recognise that not all TNCs are evil. Indeed some TNCs have played a central role in the improvements in the oral health of populations over the last fifty or so years. The paper goes on to outline how an awareness of different professional strategies can be used to frame an interdisciplinary programme of work looking at the role of TNCs in oral health. These strategies involve a professional focus on data collection and analysis, a focus on policy, being critical, being publicly involved, and acting with foresight. The paper goes on to provide an outline of how these strategies might be pursued to engage TNCs in a programme of research around inequalities in oral health. It is proposed that we form a broad collaboration between appropriate TNCs, academics and funders. This paper provides a very brief sketch about how such a program might be envisaged. © 2019, Dennis Barber Ltd.

The first project has developed a tool called Foresight-Strategy Cockpit. This software should enable the Austrian ministries to improve crisis management strategies by becoming aware of unexpected trends and future scenarios in security issues. The second project has integrated WebLyzard, a software tool for an automated analysis of online news and social media sources (comments on articles, Facebook postings and Twitter statements), to analyze the media representation of pressing societal issues and citizen’s security perceptions. The WebLyzard software was used in a case study where two independent observers performed a frequency and sentiment analysis in parallel to the automated Weblyzard results. Specific articles and user comments on selected key-topics in two major online newspapers in Austria (“Der Standard” and “Die Krone”) were counted and evaluated according to different sentiment categories. The results indicate various weaknesses of the software leading to misinterpretations, and the automated analysis yielded substantially different results compared to the sentiment analysis by the two raters, especially for cynical or irrelevant statements. Our case study highlights the potentials and limits of big-data analyses of media sources compared to those of conventional, quantitative content analysis. The results clearly show that empirical research should always be accompanied by theory-based interpretation and should highlight not only the potentials but also, specifically, the risks and weaknesses of the big data hype to counteract the allure of automated text-based analyses. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big data; Evaluation study; Security perceptions; Social media",,,,,,"Alvarez, R.M., Introduction (2016) Computational Social Science, pp. 1-24. , Alvarez RM, (ed), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Aschauer, W., (2017) Das gesellschaftliche Unbehagen in der EU.

Patients with delirium have increased risk of long-term cognitive dysfunction and mortality. The cause is unknown, which limits our ability to design therapeutic interventions. In patients undergoing surgery, low regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2), as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), is associated with postoperative neurological dysfunction (eg delirium and long-term cognitive impairment). However, the relationship between NIRS-derived rSO2 and neurological outcomes in critically ill patients is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the utilization of NIRS-derived rSO2 in critically ill patients outside the operating theater. We aimed to examine the relationship between rSO2 and neurological outcomes as well as to report rSO2 values in this population. Methods: The following databases were searched from inception to August 14, 2017: Ovid MedLine, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Results: Of 1410 articles identified by the search strategy, 8 were ultimately selected for final review. Most (7 of 8) were published since 2014. These studies included a total of 213 patients primarily with shock or respiratory failure. A variety of devices were used to measure rSO2, including INVOS and FORESIGHT. The duration of recording varied from 5 minutes to 72 hours. Four of the 8 studies reported on neurological outcomes. In all 4 studies, rSO2 was lower in critically ill patients who were delirious compared to controls, but this was only statistically significant in 2 of the studies. The heterogeneity in devices and duration of recording precluded meta-analysis. Conclusions: There is limited literature describing rSO2 in critically ill patients outside the operating room. Although there may be a slight signal of an association between low rSO2 and delirium, more study is needed to explore this relationship. © The Author(s) 2018.","CAM-ICU; cerebral oxygenation; critical illness; delirium; intensive care unit; near-infrared spectroscopy","bibliographic database; brain microcirculation; brain tissue; cardiogenic shock; central nervous system disease; cognitive defect; critical illness; critically ill patient; delirium; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; meta analysis (topic); near infrared spectroscopy; neurologic examination; neurological complication; outcome assessment; oxygen saturation; preeclampsia; priority journal; respiratory failure; Review; septic shock; shock; systematic review; tissue oxygenation",,,"EGOS-600A; Equanox, Nonin, United States; FORESIGHT; INVOS 5100, Covidien; NIRO-200, Hamamatsu, Japan","Covidien; Hamamatsu, Japan; Nonin, United States","Herridge, M.S., Moss, M., Hough, C.L., Recovery and outcomes after the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in patients and their family caregivers (2016) Intensive Care Med, 42 (5), pp. 725-738; Jutte, J., Erb, C., Jackson, J., Physical, cognitive, and psychological disability following critical illness: what is the risk?

Design/methodology/approach: Using horizon scanning, scenario analysis and expert opinion, nine capabilities are identified as core areas to be developed to support the country’s future growth of product-service systems. Findings: The results of a Delphi survey involving 30 industry and academic thought leaders recommend priorities of these capabilities. This paper concludes with a discussion of the study implications for theory, research and practice in the domain of servitisation and product-service systems. Research limitations/implications: The foresight study presented here on the future of servitisation in Singapore demonstrates one of the first fully fledged applications of foresight in constructing a coherent vision of future product-service system markets. In this study, the authors applied systemic foresight methodology (SFM) comprising the first six phases: initiation (scoping), intelligence (scanning), imagination (scenarios), integration (priorities), interpretation (strategies) and implementation (action).For future research, an ideal step would be to proceed with the final phase of the SFM, impact, to develop indicators for servitisation and to monitor and evaluate the transition process. Practical implications: Manufacturing and services are no longer distinct concepts with a clear divide. Manufacturing firms not only become more service dependent but also produce and provide services for their consumers. This transformation towards servitisation implies fundamental re-organisation of the production and management practices. Furthermore, through new business models, new and loyal customers will be gained, which will in turn bring additional income, while making the companies less prone to economic and business fluctuations. Social implications: The results of this study have practical implications for policymakers of public and private sectors that are interested in playing a key role in future product-service system innovation. These have implications for developing the human and intellectual capital that are required for supporting the future innovation. Institutes of higher learning and vocational institutes should also consider incorporating new curricula and modules to build the capabilities for knowledge creation and transfer. Originality/value: The findings of the present study on strategic growth areas and relevant critical capabilities provide new directions for research in the field of servitisation. Among the nine capabilities identified, the top three were advanced customer intelligence capability, socio-physical service quality, traceability and maintainability and integrated strategic decision-making. From the results, it is apparent that advanced customer intelligence capability is both an area of importance to Singapore and the world. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Singapore; Transition",,,,,,"Ahamed, Z., Inohara, T., Kamoshida, A., The servitization of manufacturing: an empirical case study of IBM corporation (2013) International Journal of Business Administration, 4 (2); Amanatidou, E., Saritas, O., Loveridge, D., (2016) Strategies for emerging research and innovation futures, 18 (3), pp. 253-275; Anttiroiko, A.V., Valkama, P., Bailey, S.J., Smart cities in the new service economy: building platforms for smart services (2014) AI & Society, 29 (3), pp. 323-334; Aurich, J.C., Mannweiler, C., Schweitzer, E., How to design and offer services successfully (2010) CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, 2 (3), pp. 136-143; Baines, T., (2013) Servitization Impact Study: How UK based Manufacturing Organisations Are Transforming Themselves to Compete through Services, , Aston Centre for Servitization Research and Practice, Aston Business School, Aston Business School, Aston University, Birmingham, UK; Baines, T.S., Lighfoot, H.W., Benedettini, O., Kay, J.M., The servitization of manufacturing.

Scenario method is suitable for public level policy making. Scenarios generated alternative descriptive futures in all of the development field such as disaster studies. This paper aims to systematically review the articles that generated scenarios in disaster management to attain gaps, challenges and opportunities related to use of scenario analysis in disasters. Design/methodology/approach: This is a systematic review that was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The keywords that searched included “disaster,” “emergency,” “crisis,” “disruptive event,” “futures study,” “foresight,” “scenario,” “community-based scenario planning,” “participatory scenario planning,” “scenario planning” and “scenario analysis.” The Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched. Findings: A total of 981 article gathered after initial search between electronic databases. At final step, only ten articles included in the study. The selected articles compared according to many aspects. Most of the scenarios that developed in disaster management and planning concentrated on climate change and flooding related hazards. Many of studies developed three or four scenarios that it seems the number is suitable for disaster planning. Originality/value: The paper serves as an original guideline for disaster planning. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Disaster; Emergency; Scenario analysis; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Alizadeh, R., Lund, P.D., Beynaghi, A., Abolghasemi, M., Maknoon, R., An integrated scenario-based robust planning approach for foresight and strategic management with application to energy industry (2016) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 104, pp. 162-171; Altay, N., Green, W.G., Or/Ms research in disaster operations management (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (1), pp. 475-493; Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, 46, pp. 23-40; Bañuls, V.A., Turoff, M., Scenario construction via Delphi and cross-impact analysis (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (9), pp. 1579-1602; Bañuls, V.A., Turoff, M., Hiltz, S.R., Collaborative scenario modeling in emergency management through cross-impact (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80 (9), pp. 1756-1774; Bañuls, V.A., Turoff, M., Lopez, J., Clustering scenarios using cross-impact analysis (2010) Proceedings of the Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management (ISCRAM); Bennett, N.J., Kadfak, A., Dearden, P., Community-based scenario planning: a process for vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning to social–ecological change in coastal communities (2016) Environment, Development and Sustainability, 18 (6), pp. 1771-1799; Birkmann, J., Cutter, S.L., Rothman, D.S., Welle, T., Garschagen, M., Van Ruijven, B., O’Neill, B., Pulwarty, R., Scenarios for vulnerability: opportunities and constraints in the context of climate change and disaster risk (2015) Climatic Change, 133 (1), pp. 53-68; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: an overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K.H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., scenario types and techniques: towards a user’s guide (2006) Futures, 38 (7), pp. 723-739; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Burt, G., Why are we surprised at surprises?

We integrated a futures thinking activity into an undergraduate general science course in Taiwan by using an online thinking and discussion tool that provides scaffolding questions to help students think systematically about future possibilities of the specific topic – genetically modified (GM) food. As a course assignment, the enrolled students were asked to work on and write their responses to this online scaffolding tool over five weeks. The purpose of this study was to examine students’ expressions of futures thinking on GM food as elicited through this assignment. We content analysed the written responses of 99 students who completed the online task. A particular emphasis of analysis was placed on examining students’ thoughts and ideas about ‘preferable’ or ‘desirable’ futures of GM food. Nine themes emerged from the analysis and were found be organised into three categories using factor analysis. These results provided insight into characteristics of students’ futures thinking and underlying perspectives, and can serve as a basis for future-focused curricular and instructional innovations. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Futures thinking; gene technology; genetically modified food; higher education; undergraduate general science",,,,,,"Arvanitoyannis, I.S., Krystallis, A., Consumers’ beliefs, attitudes and intentions towards genetically modified foods, based on the ‘perceived safety vs. benefits’ perspective (2005) International Journal of Food Science & Technology, 40 (4), pp. 343-360; Bal, Ş., Samancı, N.K., Bozkurt, O., University students’ knowledge and attitude about genetic engineering (2007) Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, 3 (2), pp. 119-126; Bell, W., Foreword: Preparing for the future (2006) Lessons for the future: The missing dimension in education, pp. xi-xvi. , Hicks D., (ed), Victoria, BC: Trafford Publishing,.

Although innovative designs have brought variety to the utilitarian high-rise facades clad in glass, steel and concrete, little consideration has been given to the issues of maintainability during the design/planning stage. This lack of foresight and planning has hindered the efforts of maintenance personnel and compromised the performance of such green facades. To address these concerns, an instrumental case study approach was undertaken using a series of site investigations and interviews with experts and stakeholders. The aim of this research was to strengthen the knowledge base on high-rise vertical greenery facades in the tropics, leading to the formulation of case study-based ‘design for maintainability’ (DfM) guidelines. These guidelines will assist clients, designers and contractors by providing a supplemental reference during the design, installation and maintenance of high-rise VGSs located in tropical regions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","design quality; green facade; high-rise; living wall; maintainability; quality control; Singapore; vertical greenery systems","Knowledge based systems; Maintainability; Quality control; Tall buildings; Case study approach; Design for maintainabilities; Design Quality; High rise; living wall; Maintenance personnel; Singapore; Site investigations; Facades",,,,,"Aflaki, A., Mirnezhad, M., Ghaffarianhoseini, A., Ghaffarianhoseini, A., Omrany, H., Wang, Z.H., Akbari, H., Urban heat island mitigation strategies: A state-of-the-art review on Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong (2017) Cities (London), 62, pp. 131-145; Behm, M., Poh, C.H., Safe design of skyrise greenery in Singapore (2012) Smart and Sustainable Built Environment, 1 (2), pp. 186-205; (2016), https://www.bca.gov.sg/BCA, Design for maintainability checklist version 1.3.

In practice, however, it is often driven by motives other than sustainability transformation. This paper explores the preconditions that allow urban regeneration approaches to become transformative, and suggests a methodology to support this shift in practice. It does so by assessing the capacity available to prepare for, initiate, and steer a path-deviant sustainability transformation of urban areas in three South Korean cities, jointly with stakeholders. The findings reflect how local policy largely supports a conservative development pathway, favored by national government, sidelining especially ecological implications. Major deficits exist regarding systems thinking, sustainability foresight, and social learning processes, while collective visioning, intermediation, community empowerment, and repositioning science could become instant drivers. In conclusion, assessing transformative capacity offers a crucial lever to design urban-regeneration approaches for unlearning dominant development paradigms and to experimentally reconfigure urban social–ecological–technological systems. © 2018, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Governance; Social learning; Sustainability transformation; Transformative capacity; Urban ecology; Urban regeneration","assessment method; comparative study; governance approach; learning; methodology; periurban area; stakeholder; sustainability; urban design; urban development; South Korea",,,,,"Balaban, O., Puppim de Oliveira, J.A., Understanding the links between urban regeneration and climate-friendly urban development: Lessons from two case studies in Japan (2014) Local Environment, 19, pp. 868-890; Berman, M., Kofinas, G., BurnSilver, S., Measuring community adaptive and transformative capacity in the arctic context (2017) Northern sustainabilities: understanding and addressing change in the circumpolar world, pp. 59-75. , Fondahl G, Wilson GN, (eds), Springer, Cham; Blaikie, N.W.H., (2009) Designing social research: the logic of anticipation, , 2, Polity Press, Cambridge, Malden; (2017) Ending climate change begins in the city, , C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, London; (2006) Declaration of Environmental Capital, , Changwon City Government, Changwon; Cohen-Shacham, E., Walters, G., Janzen, C., Maginnis, S., (2016) Nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges, , IUCN, Gland; Colantonio, A., Dixon, T.J., (2011) Urban regeneration & social sustainability: Best practice from European cities, , Real Estate Issues/RICS Research, Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester; Cramer, J., Loeber, A., Governance through learning: Making corporate social responsibility in Dutch industry effective from a sustainable development perspective (2004) Journal of Environmental Policy & Planning, 6, pp. 271-287; Folke, C., Carpenter, S.R., Walker, B., Scheffer, M., Chapin, T., Rockström, J., Resilience thinking: Integrating resilience, adaptability and transformability (2010) Ecology & Society, 15, pp. 1-9; Gelézeau, V., (2003) Séoul, ville géante, cités radieuses.

Thus, our paper aims to promote the sustainable transition of China by investigating the development of the policy mixes that support the sustainable transition of China's battery industry and then enrich empirical research on innovation and sustainable transition policies. Studies have shown that the majority of policy instruments in China support to transition enterprises or industries directly. The mapping exercise has pointed out destabilizing policies of important role in accelerating the transition process. Government can apply more diversified strategies (e.g., foresight exercises, voluntary agreements, venture capital, etc.) to promote sustainable transition. © 2019 IEEE.","battery industry; innovation policy; policy mix; sustainable transition","Investments; Battery industry; Empirical research; Innovation policies; Policy instruments; Sustainability transition; sustainable transition; Transition process; Voluntary agreement; Electric batteries",,,,,"Koningstein, R., Fork, D., Energy's creative destruction, "" (in English (2014) IEEE Spectrum, 51 (12), pp. 30-35. , Dec; Hartshorn, J., Maher, M., Crooks, J., Stahl, R., Bond, Z., Creative destruction: Building toward sustainability, "" (in English (2005) Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 32 (1), pp. 170-180. , Feb; Sustainable development through creative destruction (in English) (1999) Aerospace Engineering, 19 (9), p. 6. , Sep; Crabbe, A., Jacobs, R., Van Hoof, V., Bergmans, A., Van Acker, K., Transition towards sustainable material innovation: Evidence and evaluation of the Flemish case, "" (in English (2013) Journal of Cleaner Production, 56, pp. 63-72. , Oct 1; Azadegan, A., Wagner, S.M., Industrial upgrading, exploitative innovations and explorative innovations, "" (in English (2011) International Journal of Production Economics, 130 (1), pp. 54-65. , Mar; Bovea, M.D., Perez-Bells, V., Identifying design guidelines to meet the circular economy principles: A case study on electric and electronic equipment, "" (in English (2018) Journal of Environmental Management, 228, pp. 483-494. , Dec 15; Du, J.Y., Meng, X.F., Li, J.Q., Wu, X.G., Song, Z.Y., Ouyang, M.G., Insights into the characteristics of technologies and industrialization for plug-in electric cars in China, "" (in English (2018) Energy, 164, pp. 910-924. , Dec 1; Ou, S.Q., Lin, Z.H., Qi, L., Li, J., He, X., Przesmitzki, S., The dual-credit policy: Quantifying the policy impact on plug-in electric vehicle sales and industry profits in China, "" (in English (2018) Energy Policy, 121, pp. 597-610. , Oct; Kivimaa, P., Virkamaki, V., Policy mixes, policy interplay and low carbon transitions: The case of passenger transport in Finland in English (2014) Environmental Policy and Governance, 24 (1), pp. 28-41. , Jan; Kivimaa, P., Kern, F., Creative destruction or mere niche support Innovation policy mixes for sustainability transitions in English (2016) Research Policy, 45 (1), pp. 205-217. , Feb; Konefal, J., Governing sustainability transitions: Multi-stakeholder initiatives and regime change in United States agriculture (English) (2015) Sustainability, 7 (1), pp. 612-633. , Jan; Natarajan, S., Srinivasan, R., Implementation of multi agents based system for process supervision in large-scale chemical plants, "" (in English (2014) Computers & Chemical Engineering, 60, pp. 182-196. , Jan 10; Shortall, R., Davidsdottir, B., How to measure national energy sustainability performance: An Icelandic case-study, "" (in English (2017) Energy for Sustainable Development, 39, pp. 29-47. , Aug; Wang, Q., Chen, X., China's electricity market-oriented reform: From an absolute to a relative monopoly, "" (in English (2012) Energy Policy, 51, pp. 143-148. , Dec",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","8th International Conference on Industrial Technology and Management, ICITM 2019","2 March 2019 through 4 March 2019",,148005,,9781728132686,,,"English","Proc.

Its core idea is creating a logical path from a depicted future back to the present, to share, analyze and manage strategic challenges. Still its use in strategic management is under-researched. The purpose of this paper is to verify the relevance and validity of backcasting as a strategic management tool. It also analyzes and structures knowledge about backcasting and its practical application in strategic management. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs desktop research method to outline the benefits and limitations of backcasting for strategy formation under VUCA conditions. Findings: Backcasting can help organizations overcome cognitive barriers and broaden the scope of options when analyzing future positions. The research provides insights regarding the potential and limitations of backcasting when addressing uncertainty and its drivers. For instance, it helps managers to assess and align visions; increase the understanding and clarity regarding complex dependencies; as well as improve strategic agility. Practical implications: Backcasting is exceptionally useful for investigating possible futures and alternative paths to it. Backcasting is an interactive workshop-based method that challenges prevailing mindsets by assuming we are in the future, looking back towards today to find a feasible path when major transitions are necessary. With it, managers can deal with even the most uncertain decisions in a structured manner. Originality/value: Backcasting for many reasons has a great potential as a tool for strategy development. It has been successfully applied in other fields but only to a limited extent in business. This paper formally examines its applicability in this context and demonstrates its relevance for dealing with VUCA challenges. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Foresight; Strategy; VUCA",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Critique of Henry Mintzberg’s ‘the design school: reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management’ (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12 (6), pp. 449-461; Baumgartner, R.J., Rauter, R., Strategic perspectives of corporate sustainability management to develop a sustainable organization (2016) Journal of Cleaner Production, 140, pp. 81-92; Beinhocker, E.D., Robust adaptive strategies (1999) MIT Sloan Management Review, 40 (3), pp. 95-106; Bennett, N., Lemoine, J.G., What VUCA really means for you (2014) Harvard Business Review, 92 (1), p. 27; Bennett, N., Lemoine, J.G., What a difference a word makes: understanding threats to performance in a VUCA world (2014) Business Horizons, 57 (3), pp. 311-317; Boutellier, R., Deplazes, U., Loffler, K., Model of technology foresight: an innovative approach (2007) Engineering Management Conference, July 29-August 1, pp. 7-14. , IEEE International, Austin; Brazeal, G., Webs of faith as a source of reasonable disagreement (2011) Critical Review, 23 (4), pp. 421-448; Broman, G., Robèrt, K.H., Collins, T.J., Basile, G., Baumgartner, R.J., Larsson, T., Huisingh, D., Science in support of systematic leadership towards sustainability (2017) Journal of Cleaner Production, 140, pp. 1-9. , Part 1; Broman, G.I., Robèrt, K.H., A framework for strategic sustainable development (2017) Journal of Cleaner Production, 140, pp. 17-31. , Part 1; Costanzo, L.A., Strategic foresight in a high-speed environment (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 219-235; Courtney, H.G., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, S.P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 67-79; Daft, R.L., Lengel, R.H., Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design (1986) Management Science, 32 (5), pp. 554-571; de Kuijer, O., Linsen, A., Quist, J., New perspectives: sustainable technological development in agriculture (1997) Air Pollution in the 21st Century: Priority Issues and Policy, pp. 733-753. , Schneider, T.

A foresight program can help organizations map the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies and serve as a valuable input to organizational strategic planning. IRI and RTI International developed a foresight program for intelligent systems to guide companies in framing, exploring, envisioning, and acting on the impacts intelligent systems may have. Working from an intelligent systems research framework, the program identified 70 key drivers of change and developed three scenarios depicting plausible and thought-provoking visions of the future of intelligent systems. These scenarios highlight critical uncertainties and help innovators challenge conventional notions about how the future might unfold. The steps taken in developing the scenarios can provide the basis for other organizations’ use of foresight methodologies to better understand the possible impact of intelligent systems on their strategic goals and objectives. © 2019, Copyright © 2019, Innovation Research Interchange.","Artificial intelligence; Foresight; Intelligent systems; Scenario planning","Artificial intelligence; Engineering research; Emerging technologies; Foresight; Key factors; Key technologies; Scenario Planning; Strategic goals; Systems research; Intelligent systems",,,,,"Bishop, P., Hines, A., (2012) Teaching about the Future, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Bishop, P., Hines, A., (2007) Thinking about the Future: Guidelines for Strategic Foresight., , Washington, DC: Social Technologies; Vanston, J.H., Better forecasts, better plans, better results (2003) Research-Technology Management, 46 (1), pp. 47-58; Vecchiato, R., Roveda, C., Strategic foresight in corporate organizations: Handling the effect and response uncertainty of technology and social drivers of change (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77, pp. 1527-1539; Wade, W., (2012) Scenario Planning: A Field Guide to the Future, , Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons",,,,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",,,,,08956308,,RTMAE,,"English","Res Technol Manage.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065308349

Technology entity recognition (TER) is the basis for carrying out subsequent high-level technology analysis works, such as technical foresight, technology roadmap, and technological innovation. However, the challenges TER faces are much greater than that of normal named entity recognition (NER). Those challenges include the difficulty in feature extraction, the lack of annotation data, and the differences between different domains. To deal with the first challenge, we use a deep neural network to extract features from text. For the other two challenges, we propose an adversarial multitask learning method. The existing knowledge from a big dataset on a source domain is transferred to implement TER on a target domain with only a small number of labeled samples. The experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms comparison systems. © 2018 IEEE.","domain adaptation; multitask learning; technology entity recognition; transfer learning","Deep neural networks; Domain adaptation; Entity recognition; Multitask learning; Named entity recognition; Technological innovation; Technology analysis; Technology roadmaps; Transfer learning; Engineering education",,,,,"Augenstein, I., Das, M., Riedel, S., Vikraman, L., McCallum, A., SemEval 2017 Task 10: SciencelE - Extracting keyphrases and relations from scientific publications (2017) Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2017), pp. 546-555. , Canada, August; Prabhakaran, V., Hamilton, W.L., Dan, M., Dan, J., (2016) Predicting the Rise and Fall of Scientific Topics from Trends in Their Rhetorical Framing, pp. 1170-1180. , ACL 2016, Berlin, Germany; Yang, C., Zhu, D., Zhang, G., Semantic-based technology trend analysis (2015) International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Knowledge Engineering, pp. 222-228. , Taipei, China; Canobasave, A.E., Osborne, F., Salatino, A.A., Ontology forecasting in scientific literature:semantic concepts prediction based on innovation-adoption priors (2016) EKAW 2016, pp. 51-67. , Bologna, Italy; Dario, D.N., Dante, D.I., Marco, B., Maristella, A., Carlo, T., A content-based approach to social network analysis: A case study on research communities (2015) IRCDL 2015, pp. 142-154. , Bolzano, Italy; Adar, E., Datta, S., Building a scientific concept hierarchy database (SCHBASE) (2015) Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 606-615. , Beijing, China; Kathy, M., Hal, D., Snigdha, C., John, P., Kapil, T., Pablo, B., Predicting the impact of scientific concepts using full-text features (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology., 67, pp. 2684-2696. , Nov; Meyers, A., Glass, Z., Grieve-Smith, A., He, Y., Liao, S.S., Grishman, R., Jargon-term extraction by chunking (2014) Proceedings of SADAATL2014, pp. 11-20. , Dublin, Ireland; Jin, Y., Kan, M., Ng, J., He, X., Mining scientific terms and their definitions: A study of the ACL anthology (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 780-790. , Seattle, Washington, USA; Kim, S.N., Medelyan, O., Kan, M.Y., Baldwin, T., SemEval-2010 Task 5: Automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific articles (2010) Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, Uppsala, pp. 21-26. , Sweden; Asahara, M., Matsumoto, Y., Japanese named entity extraction with redundant morphological analysis (2003) Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology, pp. 8-15. , Edmonton, Canada; Borthwick, A.E., (1999) A Maximum Entropy Approach to Named Entity Recognition, , Ph.

This time the focus isn't thematic but regional and relates to Africa. The first contribution to the series concerns foresight studies as practised in Africa and, to set the scene, in this article Souleymane Bachir Diagne shows how foresight philosophy has gained a footing in Africa, how it is developing and how it should be viewed on that continent. After reminding us of the need for the foresight practitioner to look ahead and think for a generation and an era different from her own, Souleymane Bachir Diagne recalls, in a nuanced way, the arguments that African time is very particular and that a culturally different approach is therefore required with regard to foresight. He also stresses the degree to which the African continent is emblematic of the future, given the youth of its population. This demographic dynamism and youthfulness - together with the economic rise of Africa - should breed hope not fear, as Bachir Diagne sees it, contrary to what is implied in some alarmist arguments around migration that have enjoyed a certain vogue in Europe in recent years. And, ultimately too, it is through education (beginning with the education of girls), by encouraging Africa to prepare its youth for a different era, that foresight studies can and should find application on the continent. © 2019 Futuribles.

The authors, who are leading researchers at the Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, reveal discrepancies between a series of provisions in the document and the current level of Russia’s economic development, primarily in science and technology. The document provides virtually no economic rationale or analysis of what causes the loss of science and technology potential in Russia. The attempt to foresee the technological development of individual Russian regions is unsuccessful. The general conclusion is that the foresight document does not provide a single platform for the development and implementation of strategic planning documents in the field of science and technology. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,"Forecast of the Scientific and Technological Development of the Russian Federation for the Period until 2030 (2017) Compliance with the Requirements of the Federal Law of June 28, 2014 No. 172-FZ “On Strategic Planning in the Russian Federation”, , Draft of December 19; The Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of July 13, 2015 No. 699 (2015) On Approval of the Rules for Developing and Adjusting the Forecast of the Scientific and Technological Development of the Russian Federation, , Moscow; The Strategy of Innovative Development of the Russian Federation for the Period until 2020 (2011) Approved by the Order of the Government of the Russian Federation of December 8, , No. 2227-r; The Decree of the President of the Russian Federation (2016) On the Strategy of the Scientific and Technological Development of the Russian Federation, p. 642. , http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&firstDoc=1&lastDoc=1&nd=102416645, of December 1; (2016), http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/df/energy-economics/energy-outlook-2016/bp-energy-outlook-2016.pdf, BP, 2017; (2016) Global Wind Energy Council, GWEC (Greenpeace), Brussels, , http://www.gwec.net/publications/global-wind-energy-outlook/global-wind-energy-out-look-2016; (2015) IHS Energy, , https://ihsmarkit.com/pdf/GlobalScenarios2014Brochure-5878-0614AA-LoRes_186289110913-044932.pdf; (2017), http://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2016/november/world-energy-outlook-2016.html, International Energy Agency, Paris; (2016) Inst.

The first contribution to this series is concerned with foresight studies as practised in Africa; and, in the article that follows, the director of the African Futures Institute (AFI) Alioune Sail offers a conspectus of discourses and practices in the field of foresight that have been seen in Africa over some 40 years now. He shows, for example, the extent to which the African states, in their concern to develop national or regional 'visions' to guide their development strategies, committed themselves to the discipline as early as the 1960s - and even more significantly from the 1990s onwards. After quite a detailed review of these many foresight exercises undertaken in Africa, he analyses their chief characteristics: he shows how and in what context they have been carried out and he stresses the institutional difficulties they have run up against in some instances etc. Lastly, he examines the potential evolution of national long-term perspective studies (the NLTPSs that have been very widely promoted by the AFI), given the ways these have been implemented, the degree of involvement of the actors (states, international organizations, development aid agencies etc.), their impact etc., urging that foresight exercises be continued in Africa, while nonetheless taking account of their previous track record, so that they may play a more effective role in shaping development strategies. © 2019 Futuribles.

Together with other recent technological advances, it gave rise to calls for strengthening the role of the Austrian parliament as a forum of informed debate about both the promising and the problematic implications of emerging technologies for the future of our economies and societies. In contrast to parliaments in several other European countries, the Austrian parliament has not been endowed with a dedicated foresight and technology assessment (TA) support function up to now. Only recently such a function has been tested in the context of a pilot project on Industry 4.0, which fulfilled a double role of devising and testing a methodology for providing support to the Committee on Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) and of giving substantive and accessible input to the emerging parliamentary and public debates about Industry 4.0. This paper provides insights into the process tailored to the parliament's needs and its outcomes. The focus is on the design of the process and the facilitation of debates informed by an assessment of opportunities and challenges of Industry 4.0. The underlying analysis of societal implications covers a number of key areas; a summary of the results on skill demands and safety and security serves as an example. In line with the growing attention that is generally paid to foresight and TA in policy making, we reflect on how parliaments may integrate these practices into their procedures and thus acquire a more prominent role as forums for debating the dynamics of future socio-technical change with all its potential promises, drawbacks and associated governance challenges. © 2018","Foresight; Governance; Parliament; Socio-Technical change; Technology assessment","governance approach; information and communication technology; innovation; Internet; parliament; Austria",,,,,"Aichholzer, G., Rhomberg, W., Gudowsky, N., Saurwein, F., Weber, M., Industry 4.0 - Background paper on the pilot project “Industry 4.0: Foresight & technology assessment on the social dimension of the next industrial revolution” (2015) Institute of Technology Assessment, Austrian Institute of Technology (eds.)

The benefits are clear when the contract water quantity can be guaranteed by the seller. Where water right allocations are subject to interannual variability, guaranteed delivery may not be feasible. Skillful season-ahead forecasts of water right allocations and crop market prices have the potential to inform option contracts in such circumstances. Here, two theoretical growers' cooperatives, representing high-value and low-value cropping within a basin, are modeled as exclusive water-trading partners. A two-firm demand equilibrium model is developed from a coupled crop yield and economic model, conditioned on each cooperative's production inputs. Subsequently, several combinations of single-stage and multistage season-ahead forecasts of allocations and crop prices inform both the demand and an option contract model. Evaluating combinations of forecast and persistence-informed models against a perfect foresight-informed model, both the efficacy of the forecast-informed option contract framework and the value of forecast information are determined. Results indicate combinations including multistage season-ahead forecasts of allocations produce results that most closely represent expected trade volume, direction of trading, and market-scale joint profitability across a range of intercooperative water rights ownership scenarios. The multistage allocation forecasts exert more influence over option contract utility than forecasts of product market prices. This work highlights the value of forecast-informed decision making as it pertains to promoting market-scale economic and water use efficiency. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Commerce; Costs; Crops; Decision making; International law; Equilibrium modeling; Forecast information; Guaranteed delivery; Informed decision; Interannual variability; Perfect foresights; Seasonal forecasts; Water use efficiency; Forecasting; annual variation; crop yield; decision making; forecasting method; resource allocation; seasonal variation; water economics; water resource; water use efficiency",,,,,"Armstrong, J.S., (2001) Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practitioners, , Berlin, Germany: Springer; Bauer, C.J., Results of Chilean water markets: Empirical research since 1990 (2004) Water Resour.

And how do connections arise from remoteness? In this article, I address these questions by taking remoteness and connectivity not as opposites but as entangled forces that condition each other. To explore this evolving nexus, I focus on provisions: the notion of provision denotes, at once, a foresight or visions of a better future, a rule or law, and supplies coming in from the outside. Looking into three junctures of cutting connections and forging ties in the Tajik Pamirs – the Soviet system of Moscow provisioning, wayfaring Pajero drivers and international trophy hunting – I show how provisions (of all three kinds) were instrumental in shaping the repeating return of remoteness in the region. © 2019 European Association of Social Anthropologists","conservation; cross-border trade; hunting; Moscow provisioning; Pamirs; remoteness; Tajikistan",,,,,,"Alff, H., Flowing goods, hardening borders?

Each player starts the game as the leader of a small undeveloped village, surrounded by undeveloped resource fields. Creating military units will allow them to attack a person or defend from enemy attacks. Players can join as a team. Allies may trade resources through trade market or send reinforcements when others are being attacked. An alliance can win the game by destroying the enemy alliance completely. The main motive of the game is to gather resources with villagers, developing village by constructing new buildings, creating as many troops as you can and destroying the enemy alliance with your alliance. The current Model is developed using mean stack. A standard java stack called MEAN is used for designing and building the dynamic web pages. Also the same software is used for MongoDB and other sources etc,. The current work sparks the player’s creativity, develops problem solving skills, and improves one’s planning, management and foresight.

The aim of this study is to elicit expert views on critical changes in the sector through an outlook towards 2030 and 2050, as well as to analyze how these views relate to the understanding of bioeconomy. The study employs a three-round Delphi survey with 41 experts representing different sectors and societal perspectives across Europe. Forty statements based on initial explorative interviews were evaluated by the panel in two consecutive rounds of web-based questionnaires. Results reveal the highest consensus among panellists relates to the diversification of the forest industries and the dependence of the sector on climate and energy policies. The greatest dispersion of expert opinions was found to relate to the possible discontinuation of bioenergy market growth, the possible segregation of forest management, change in forest ownership structure, and the shortage of biomass supply in the long–run. Additionally, the concept of bioeconomy was regarded by the majority as a vision for the future, rather than a depiction of real changes.

Whether or not children choose the correct item to bring back to the first room is the dependent measure of interest in this “spoon test.” Although children as young as 3 or 4 years typically succeed on this test, whether they would pass a more stringent version in which they must verbally generate (vs. select) the correct item in the absence of any cues is unknown. This is an important point given that humans must often make decisions about the future without being explicitly “prompted” by the future-oriented option. In Experiment 1, using an adapted version of the spoon test, we show that as the “generative” requirements of the task increase, 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds’ (N = 99) performance significantly decreases. We replicate this effect in Experiment 2 (N = 48 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds) and also provide preliminary evidence that the capacity to verbally generate the correct item in a spoon test may draw more heavily on children's category fluency skills than does their capacity to select this item among a set of distracters. Our findings underscore the importance of examining more generative forms of future thought in young children. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","category fluency; Cognition; Development; Episodic future thinking; Generativity; spoon test","article; child; cognition; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; skill",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Pan, L., Musicaro, R., Schacter, D.L., Divergent thinking and constructing episodic simulations (2016) Memory, 24, pp. 89-97; Adlam, A.-L.R., Patterson, K., Bozeat, S., Hodges, J.R., The Cambridge semantic memory test battery: Detection of semantic deficits in semantic dementia and Alzheimer's disease (2010) Neurocase, 16, pp. 193-207; Atance, C.M., Louw, A., Clayton, N.S., Thinking ahead about where something is needed: New insights about episodic foresight in preschoolers (2015) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 129, pp. 98-109; Atance, C.M., Mahy, C.E.V., Episodic future thinking in children: Methodological and theoretical approaches (2016) Seeing the future: Theoretical perspectives on future-oriented mental time travel, pp. 367-385. , K.

Although the computation capability of a vehicle is limited, multi-type of edge computing nodes provide heterogeneous resources for intelligent vehicular services. When offloading the complex service to the vehicular edge computing node, the decision for its destination should be considered according to numerous factors. This paper mostly formulate the offloading decision as a resource scheduling problem with single or multiple objective function and constraints, where some customized heuristics algorithms are explored. However, offloading multiple data dependence tasks in a complex service is a difficult decision, as an optimal solution must understand the resource requirement, the access network, the user mobility, and importantly the data dependence. Inspired by recent advances in machine learning, we propose a knowledge driven (KD) service offloading decision framework for IoV, which provides the optimal policy directly from the environment. We formulate the offloading decision for the multiple tasks as a long-term planning problem, and explore the recent deep reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal solution. It can scruple the future data dependence of the following tasks when making decision for a current task from the learned offloading knowledge. Moreover, the framework supports the pre-training at the powerful edge computing node and continually online learning when the vehicular service is executed, so that it can adapt the environment changes and can learn policy that are sensible in foresight. The simulation results show that KD service offloading decision converges quickly, adapts to different conditions, and outperforms a greedy offloading decision algorithm. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","deep reinforcement learning; Internet of Vehicle; knowledge driven; multi-task; service offloading decision","Complex networks; Edge computing; Machine learning; Optimal systems; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Vehicles; Heterogeneous resources; Heuristics algorithm; Intelligent Services; knowledge driven; Multiple objective functions; Reinforcement learning approach; Resource requirements; service offloading decision; Deep learning",,,,,"Hou, X., Li, Y., Chen, M., Wu, D., Jin, D., Chen, S., Vehicular fog computing: A viewpoint of vehicles as the infrastructure (2016) IEEE Trans.

The application of such technology has become publicly available and has proved its effectiveness as an added layer of security through native applications. Until now, there has been no previous attempt at bringing this solution to a web-based platform supporting real time classification. With frequent reports of websites being exploited and databases being leaked, there is an urgent need for an intelligent security mechanism to overlay the current traditional authentication methods, including usernames and passwords. This paper investigates the possibility of unobtrusive, continuous authentication for web applications based on facial data collected using WebAssembly driven detection algorithms. This novel detection technique has proved the viability to perform real-time image processing on the web with the possibility of achieving near native speeds.

The “survivor syndrome” is borrowed from the human resources literature and presented as a metaphor for foresight to illustrate how better “scenarios” can be achieved by understanding the syndrome better. A practice perspective is given on the use of a seven-theme framework as a method of interviewing survivors. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws from an empirical research that took place during the 2008 global financial crisis to illustrate the richness of the insights that would otherwise not be obtainable through scenario planning methods that do not involve “survivors.” In that research, semi-structured interviews were employed with key personnel at multiple levels of one private and one public organization that had undergone a redundancy process at the time of the crisis to explore its effect on the remaining workforce. Findings: The “survivor syndrome” itself would be minimized if managers consider the feelings of survivors with more open communication. Survivors in private firms were found generally to experience anxiety, but are more likely to remain more motivated, than their counterparts in the public sector. These detailed insights create more accurate “scenarios” in scenario planning exercises. Originality/value: Organizational performance can be better enhanced if the survivor syndrome can be better managed. In turn, scenario planning, as a form of organizational foresight, is better practiced through managing the survivor syndrome. Scenario planning methodology has proliferated well in the human resource management literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Performance management; Scenario planning",,,,,,"Adams, J.S., Inequity in social exchange (1965) Advances in Experimental Psychology, pp. 267-299. , Berkowitz, L.

The present study attempts to develop a complete product/service offering by exploring and examining the different combinations of online shopping attributes to provide the customized experience. Therefore, this study aims to fill the gap of customer desired experience and present scenario in online shopping behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The exploration of attributes pertaining to online shopping behavior was done by seeking theoretical support from different technology adoption theories/models and the Delphi technique, exercised with active participants of online and offline shopping. The theoretical and experience shared attributes were devised and social desirability scale (SDS) was used for eliminating the social desirability bias. Further, the questionnaire was administered online and offline during mall intercept. The Conjoint analysis was used to investigate the relative importance and utilities of the attributes and its levels individually and compositely at different levels. Findings: In the context, brand loyalty, online reputation management and Web interactivity were found most relavant followed by e-WOM, perceived risk and price. The specific levels of attributes such as taking consumer advice, search engine optimization (SEO), perception-based interactivity, consumer message boards, product risk and discount pricing were the crucial in motivating the customers for online shopping. This research affords the avenue for the marketers to motivate and delight consumers to retribalize by the way of “e-tribalizing.” Research limitations/implications: The current study was conducted in confined geographical locations and limited in sample size; thus, the issue of generalization may prevail, but forthcoming researchers may exercise the techniques with better probabilistic sampling technique. The mass customization of the website features by comparing attribute orientation of customers around websites was recommended with the third-party certification to reduce the consumers’ perceived risk during online shopping. Finally, the different levels, such as Facebook fan page in ORM and Everyday Low Price (EDLP) in pricing may be considered for the future research work. Originality/value: The research studies on online shopping behavior with Web interactivity, e-WOM, perceived risk, brand loyalty, ORM and price using a decompositional technique are scant. This study persuades the customers to go for online shopping by putting them in the almost real-time purchasing scenario. The study confirmed the need of people to retribalize through e-tribalization by the way of customization for the masses in the context of online shopping. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Conjoint analysis; e-word of mouth; On-line reputation management; Perceived risk; Web interactivity",,,,,,"Aaker, D., (1991) Managing Brand Equity.

The following tasks have been set to prove the fidelity of this judgment: to analyze Foresight concept regarding application of this method, to allocate and describe the main stages of Foresight development and to establish regularity and the reasons of bifurcation of this method based on these stages, to prove the need of Foresight application in the modern world especially in the project management sphere. The authors have established two opposite approaches to perception of a complex of actions during the research, which make Foresight so necessary for project management: present-future and future-present. The deep analysis of historical development of Foresight has allowed establishing relationship of cause and effect of this phenomenon. The assessment of compatibility of methods of Foresight in a percentage ratio for successful implementation of the project was carried out on the basis of scientists' researches. Also, studying of this problem has shown that qualification and creativity are the main criteria for evaluation of efficiency when it comes to use of the whole complex of Foresight methods. This approach allows to optimize and rationalize project activities and to increase the general indicators of efficiency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Efficiency; Manufacture; Project management; Cause and effects; Criteria for evaluations; Digital society; Historical development; Project activities; Decision making",,,,,"Tretiak, V.P., (2009) Economic Strategy, 8, pp. 52-59; Tsirenshchikov, V.S., (2016) Modern Europe, 5, pp. 23-33; Gorbatova, A., (2014) Foresight: The Movement of the Future to the Present News of Science in Higher School of Economics National Research University; (2005) Technology Foresight Manual, , United Nations Industrial Development Organization (Vienna: United Nations Industrial Development Organization); Sokolov, A.V., (2008) HSE Foresight Journal, 1, p. 8; Kryukov, S.V., (2010) Terra Economicus, 8; Samarukha, V.I., (2008) Innovation Science Education, 5, pp. 183-201; Sepiashvili, E.N., (2014) The Theory and Practice of Social Development, 3, pp. 122-124; Johnston, R., (2012) Foresight Journal, 14 (1), pp. 56-68; Efimov, V.S., Lapteva, A.V., (2009) Journal of Siberian Federal University.

The paper investigates technological prospects of priorities implementation indicated in the 'Strategy for the Scientific and Technological Development of the Russian Federation'. More precisely, we examine the advanced digital and intelligent production technologies deployment by applying foresight methods and new solutions such as an advanced text-mining. The main goal of the study is to define a range of the most promising technologies with respect to markets and products within the priority. We identified five large cross-cutting areas manifesting physical and digital convergence. These clusters include computer modelling and flexible manufacturing systems from the production side, and sensor technologies, virtual/augmented reality, the Internet of Things from the IT side. The revealed technological trends correspond to global patterns and unveil a range of sectoral applications. Product development technologies are confessed to be the core of digital manufacturing. During the analysis we uncovered 350 prospective products and services that should be exposed to further expert evaluation. Our results offer a new insight on science and technology policy-making by adjusting technology development across industries. A suggested framework allows expanding current boundaries of forecasting activities at the national level in order to boost Russian scientific performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data mining; Flexible manufacturing systems; Development technology; Digital manufacturing; Emerging technologies; Products and services; Science and technology policy; Scientific performance; Technological development; Technology development; Technological forecasting",,,,,"(2017) Emerging Trends in Global Advanced Manufacturing: Challenges, Opportunities and Policy Responses, pp. 46-51. , IfM, UNIDO (Cambridge: Institute for Manufacturing, Cambridge University); (2017) The Next Production Revolution: Implications for Governments and Business, p. 422. , OECD (Paris: Publishing); (2018) Industrial Development Report 2018 Demand for Manufacturing: Driving Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development, p. 274. , UNIDO (Vienna: United Nations Industrial Development Organization); (2017) Digital Transformation Monitor Germany: Industrie 4.0, p. 8. , European Commission (Brussels: European Commission); Reischauer, G., (2018) Technol.

The major global crises we are enmeshed in are largely the result of dominant worldviews that do not correspond sufficiently with the realities of how the cosmos works. Although what humanity has learned through science has some areas of correspondence it does not have the requisite variety to correlate with the complexities unleashed in the Anthropocene. This is clear from the feedback that the world system is giving us in areas of, for example, climate change, species extinction, mental stress, and endemic violence. In this article it is proposed that the resulting deficiency of foresight occurs because our current notions of time and our resulting way of organizing and interpreting our world that follows from that seriously restricts our understanding where it is most needed. This article introduces an alternative view of time as only one of seven dimensions of our lived experience and opens more scope for practical as well as theoretical understanding. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Consciousness; dimensions; experience; future; present moment; second-order; time",,,,,,"Albert, D.Z., (2000) Time and chance, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bennett, J.G., (1956) The dramatic universe, 1. , London, UK: Hodder and Stoughton; Bennett, J.G., What is time?

Within this paradigm, biomass plays an invaluable role in meeting the food, feed, energy and material needs of future generations. Current EU thinking advocates biomass for high-value materials, which is not aligned with EU public policy support for ‘lower value’ bioenergy applications. ‘High-technology’ and ‘no bioenergy mandate’ pathways explore market conditions that generate a more equitable distribution between competing biomass conversion technologies and competing biomass and fossil technologies. In achieving greater equity, these pathways ease biomass market tensions; enhance EU food security; improve EU biobased trade balances; accelerate biomaterial sectors’ output performance and favour macroeconomic growth. Moreover, an additional 80% increase in the oil price signals a tipping point in favour of first generation biofuels, whilst simultaneously boosting output in advanced material conversion technologies even more than the high-technology pathway. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This development has resulted in the growth of Yangon over its previous administrative boundaries and in tremendous changes of land use. Changes in land use have led to a growing number of environmental problems and a lack of infrastructure. The negative effects of spontaneous land use pattern, such as insufficient land use and damage of the natural resources along with the urban environmental problems of the mega-size urban area, can hardly be overcome after arising. They have to be minimized in advance by a foresight concept of efficient framework for land utilization pattern of future urban expansion in the Yangon City. This city has higher population density due to more accessible and positive economic situations than other areas. In this paper, the greened pedestrian linkage for Yangon Central Business District (C.B.D.), in which the largest number of colonial period buildings in Southeast Asia is located, is suggested. The essential requirements for the improvement and landscaping links are indicated, and this linkage may be an effective part of the green areas for the city's ecological framework. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Land use; Population statistics; Central business districts; Economic situation; Environmental problems; Land use pattern; Land utilization; Population densities; Southeast Asia; Urban expansion; Economics",,,,,"Pyone, T.T., (2002) Urban Development in Myanmar, to Seminar Report 11th International Seminar on Land Readjustment and Urban Development, , Japan; Mie Tin, M., (2005) New Opportunities for Housing in Yangon Mega City, Seminar Report German Myanmar Workshop on Sustainable and Urban Development in the Mega City Yangon, , Yangon University, Myanmar; Malaysian Industry Government Group for High Technology and Institute of Sultan Iskandar, ""Yangon Strategic Development Plan (Interim Report)"" (YCDC, Yangon Myanmar, 2005); http://myanmarmaps.com/, Myanmar Maps; Moe, S.S., (2009) GMSARN International Journal, 3, pp. 179-186; Department of Population Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population with Technical assistance from UNFPA, ""The 2014 Myanmar Population and housing census"" (2014); Yangon Heritage Trust, ""The Role of Heritage in the Sustainable Development of Yangon"", Building the Future, Report of an International Conference held in Yangon (Myanmar, 2015); (2018) Yangon Heritage Strategy, 1, p. 152. , Yangon Heritage Trust; (2015) The State of Local Governance: Trends in Yangon, , UNDP Myanmar; Bansal, B., Fox, E., (2016) Yangon: Architectural Guide, , DOM Publishers; (2016) Yangon 2040 An Attractive International Port and Logistics Hub: The City of Blue, , Yangon Region Government (YCDC), Green and Gold; Vanden Berg, R., (2016) Guidelines for Urban Planning; Win, H.S.M., Hlain, M., Shwe, T., Comparison between green area ratio of yangon's housing estates and foreign housing estates (2014) IJETAE, 4 (2); Su, S., (2006) Liveable Cities-Myanmar Experience: Approach Systematic Urban and Management System of Yangon Central Business District, , Toward Liveable Cities-The ASEAN Way World Town Planning Day Malaysia; Maps, G., https://www.google.com/maps/","Belkin, A.; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, 26, Yaroslavskoe Shosse, Russian Federation; email: an.belkin@mail.ru","Zheltenkov A.",,"EDP Sciences","2018 Topical Problems of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Environmental Economics, TPACEE 2018","3 December 2018 through 5 December 2018",,146660,22671242,,,,"English","E3S Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064408544

When the comparison is feasible, therefore, there is large opportunity for learning and methodological refinement. The authors of this study had the opportunity to re-examine the findings of a technology foresight exercise on the medical device industry with realized technological performance, five years later. Among the findings of the comparison exercise, intriguing false positive as well as false negative cases have been identified. The paper suggests that these cases are due to specific cognitive and motivational biases of experts and examines the way in which they are at work in the foresight process. It argues that these biases are due to the inability of experts to reason systematically in abstract (or “functional”) terms during the whole foresight process. It also suggests a methodology to mitigate the biases and to manage the emergence of false positives and false negatives. © 2018","Abstract reasoning; Cognitive biases; Expert forecast; Failure mode analysis; Functional analysis; Medical device industry","Functional analysis; Technological forecasting; Cognitive bias; Expert forecasts; Failure mode analysis; False negatives; Medical device industry; Motivational bias; Technological performance; Technology foresight; Forecasting; cognition; failure analysis; forecasting method; future prospect; hospitality industry; technology",,,,,"Altshuller, G.S., Creativity As an Exact Science: The Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems (1984), 1984. , Gordon and Breach Science Publishing New York; Anderson, J., Technology foresight for competitive advantage (1997) Long Range Plan., 30 (5), pp. 665-677; Apreda, R., Bonaccorsi, A., Fantoni, G., Gabelloni, D., Functions and failures, how to manage technological promises for societal challenges (2013) Tech.

We reviewed the literature surrounding the validity of this distinction. RECENT FINDINGS: Many physicians from different specialties express a perceived distinction between intention and foresight. The distinction between intention and foresight differs from the morally irrelevant distinction between doing and allowing. Intention and foresight may be distinguished by their opposing directions of fit between world and mind. Intention is held to be of greater moral significance than foresight because it guides and constrains our actions, determines the moral quality of our actions, and expresses the moral character of the agent. Opponents of the distinction argue that it undermines moral accountability for foreseen consequences of our actions and is overly concerned with the physician's state of mind rather than the patient's experience. They also argue that intentions may be vague and difficult to express or ascertain. SUMMARY: Several reasons may be given in favor of the distinction between intention and foresight. Given this distinction, the moral permissibility of withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy does not necessarily entail the moral permissibility of physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia.",,"assisted suicide; behavior; bioethics; ethics; euthanasia; human; legislation and jurisprudence; medical ethics; physician; psychology; treatment withdrawal; Bioethical Issues; Ethics, Medical; Euthanasia; Humans; Intention; Physicians; Suicide, Assisted; Withholding Treatment",,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,14736500,,,"30817393","English","Curr Opin Anaesthesiol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062402267

Drawing on a resource-based view and the organizational support literature, we proposed a model wherein technology roadmapping mediates the indirect relationship between corporate foresight and innovation, and perceived organizational support has a moderating effect on the relationship between technology roadmapping and innovation. We tested this model in a field study involving 212 organizations, finding support for the hypothesized relationships.

To demonstrate the methodology and computer supported analysis system, the patent portfolios of two global smart e-retailers are compared. The patents in each company’s portfolio are text mined and categorized based on the smart retailing ontology schema. Both cases’ text mining results are plotted as patent portfolio roadmaps, linking patents to innovation categories, commercial applications, and business process models. The three-dimensional (3-D) patent valuation analysis method provides foresights of the companies’ competitive advantages related to “patent scope” (PS), “patent importance” (PI), and “patent innovation” (PIN). The research implements a computer supported system to provide evidence how companies utilize patent portfolios as key strategies for protecting business related intellectual properties (IPs) while implementing sustainable and competitive business processes.

Despite the importance of customizing roadmaps to firm/industry specific managerial needs and environmental conditions, the existing literature has focused on the simplified roadmapping process. Little attention has been paid to the customization of roadmaps. Our proposed methodological approach, suggested through a case study, brings together several targeted roadmaps and integrates them into one overarching roadmap — the umbrella roadmap as a new flexible systemic tool. The integrated umbrella roadmap delivers a framework of the industry/company's overall expectations (trends, etc.), whereas targeted roadmaps focus on local targets for a specific product/technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Foresight; Innovation; Strategic planning; Targeted roadmap; Technology roadmaps","Strategic planning; Changing environment; Environmental conditions; Foresight; Media industry; Methodological approach; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Technology roadmaps; Engineering",,,,,"Abbasi, M., Vassilopoulou, P., Stergioulas, L., Technology roadmap for the creative industries (2017) Creative Ind.

The research utilized the grounded theory approach to conduct the interviews and the analysis of the data was done with NVivo 8.0 software. It was found that organizational performance can be achieved by using technology for talent management. It highlights the role of talent metrics and analytics and HR business partnerships in organizational performance. This study proposes a theoretical model for the usage of talent management technology towards organizational performance using the grounded theory perspective.

As granted patent rights provide temporary exclusivity to commercialize inventions, emerging technologies are marked by brisk increases in patenting, revealing patent-based information as sources for corporate technology intelligence. In this paper, I analyze one such emerging technology, smart houses, which refers to connected and centrally controlled everyday household solutions. I provide a detailed technology landscape study that tracks longitudinal patenting changes in the technology during the 18-year period from 2000 to 2017. Central to the analyses is the use of smart indicators and longitudinal annual data, allowing tracking changes over time. The analyses encompass general patenting trends in the technology of smart houses, including the detection of key players, pertinent technology class developments, and most relevant countries for the technology of smart houses. The case study results indicate that the use of smart indicators and longitudinal data supplements established patent indicators in technology intelligence by providing additional insights to the emergence of new technologies that cannot be detected by conventional measures. © 2019 The Author(s).","Emerging technologies; longitudinal data; patent analytics; smart houses; smart indicators; technological change; technological forecasting; technological foresight; technology intelligence",,,,,,"Allison, J.R., Lemley, M.A., Moore, K.A., Trunkey, R.D., Valuable patents (2004) Georgetown Law Journal, 92 (3), pp. 435-479; Altuntas, S., Dereli, T., Kusiak, A., Forecasting technology success based on patent data (2015) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 96, pp. 202-214; Baron, J., Pohlmann, T., Blind, K., Essential patents and standard dynamics (2016) Research Policy, 45 (9), pp. 1762-1773; Basberg, B.L., Patents and the measurement of technological change: A survey of the literature (1987) Research Policy, 16 (2-4), pp. 131-141; Bower, J.L., Christensen, C.M., Disruptive technologies: Catching the wave (1995) Harvard Business Review, 73 (1), pp. 43-53; Brem, A., Nylund, P.A., Hitchen, E.L., Open innovation and intellectual property rights: How do SMEs benefit from patents, industrial designs, trademarks and copyrights?

This paper explores the process that outperforming managers used to detect and interpret weak signals. Interviews with 13 top-managers were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to allow the process to emerge. The findings confirmed earlier conclusions on perceptual filters that reduce the number and type of signals assessed. Contrary to earlier findings, the process was significantly altered to compensate for this loss in two ways. First, managers deliberately postponed their assessment of a weak signal by discussing it with people with distinct and second, some managers deliberately searched for signals that were unfamiliar and not fitting their mental model. The sample consisted of outperforming top managers, which raised questions about the generalizability of the findings in specific directions: are the alterations in the weak signal process exemplary for outperformers only, and how does its success compare to formal foresight methods. Finally, the findings have managerial relevance since they indicate how to detect and bring weak signals into the company before impact. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging change; Perception; Perceptual filter; Top manager; Weak signal","assessment method; decision making; perception",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., Scanning the business environment (1967), Macmillan New York; Anderson, M.H., Nichols, M.L., Information gathering and changes in threat and opportunity perceptions (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44 (3), pp. 367-387; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (000002), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic management (1979), Palgrave Macmillan UK London; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issue management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1 (2), pp. 131-148; Ansoff, H.I., Sullivan, P.A., Optimizing profitability in turbulent environments: A formula for strategic success (1993) Long Range Planning, 26 (5), pp. 11-23; Auster, E., Choo, C.W., Environmental scanning by CEO's in two Canadian industries (1993) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 44 (4), pp. 194-203; Auster, E., Choo, C.W., How senior managers acquire and use information in environmental scanning (1994) Information Processing & Management, 30 (5), pp. 607-618; Battistella, C., De Toni, A.F., A methodology of technological foresight: A proposal and field study (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (6), pp. 1029-1048; Beal, R.M., Competing effectively: Environmental scanning, competitive strategy, and organizational performance in small manufacturing firms (2000) Journal of Small Business Management, 38 (1), p. 27; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: Designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Association for information systems proceeding of the americas conference on information systems, , J.N.D.

Based on the traditional role of the Spacecraft Communicator (CapCom), the SciCom was tasked with utilizing their science expertise to understand the inputs from the science backroom, and to quickly and effectively distill those into executable tasks communicated to the crew. The role was demonstrated to be a crucial component of the success of these tests. Certain skills were determined to be essential for a SciCom to develop; these included science knowledge germane to the mission, good communications skills, diplomacy, the ability to multitask, and the ability to advocate for the crew. Key attributes of the SciCom role include: the ability to balance science team goals and requirements with crew needs on a science-driven tactical timeline; using good judgment, strong situational awareness, foresight, and experience to meet the needs of each team; fostering a good relationship with their Science Lead (SciLead); anticipating and being proactive in addressing issues; and strengthening constructive cross-referencing and cross-education with the SciLead. These attributes mimic the relationship between the CapCom and the Flight Director. © 2018 IAA",,"Aerospace engineering; Astronomy; Field test; Flight operation; Human mission; Key attributes; Science communicators; Situational awareness; Rats",,,,,"Eppler, D.B., Adams, B., Archer, D., Baiden, G., Brown, A., Carey, W., Cohen, B., Young, K., Desert Research and Technology Studies (DRATS) 2010 science operations: operational approaches and lessons learned for managing science during human planetary surface missions (2013) Acta Astronaut., 90, pp. 224-241; Phinney, W.C., Science Training History of the Apollo Astronauts, NASA/SP-2015-626 (2015), p. 330; Yingst, R.A., Cohen, B.A., Ming, D.W., Eppler, D.B., Comparing Apollo and Mars Exploration Rover (MER)/phoenix operations paradigms for human exploration during NASA Desert-RATS science operations (2013) Acta Astronaut., 90, pp. 311-317; Love, S.G., Bleacher, J.E., Crew roles and interactions in scientific space exploration (2013) Acta Astronaut., 90, pp. 318-331; Bleacher, J.E., Hurtado, J.M., Young, K., Rice, J., Garry, W.B., The effect of different operations modes on science capabilities during the 2010 Desert RATS test: insights from the 2010 Desert RATS geologist crewmembers (2013) Acta Astronaut., 90, pp. 356-366; Yingst, R.A., Russell, P., ten Kate, I.L., Noble, S., Graff, T., Graham, L.D., Eppler, D., Designing remote operations strategies to optimize science mission goals: lessons learned from the Moon Mars Analog Mission Activities Mauna Kea 2012 field test (2015) Acta Astronaut., 113, pp. 120-131; Yingst, R.A., Cohen, B.A., Hynek, B., Schmidt, M., Schrader, C., Rodriguez, A., Testing Mars exploration rover-inspired operational strategies for semi-autonomous rovers on the moon II: the GeoHeuristic operational strategies test in Alaska (2014) Acta Astronaut., 99, pp. 24-36; Yingst, R.A., Berger, J., Cohen, B.A., Hynek, B., Schmidt, M., Determining best practices in reconnoitering sites for habitability potential on Mars using a semi-autonomous rover: a GeoHeuristic Operational Strategies Test (2017) Acta Astronom., 132, pp. 268-281; Chappell, S.P., Beaton, K.H., Newton, C., Graff, T.G., Young, K.E., Coan, D., Abercromby, A.F.J., Gernhardt, M.L., Integration of an Earth-based science team during human exploration of Mars (2017) Aerospace Conference 2017 IEEE, pp. 1-11; Hurtado, J.M., Jr., Young, K.E., Bleacher, J.E., Garry, W.B., Rice, J.W., Jr., Field geologic observation and sample collection strategies for planetary surface exploration: insights from the 2010 Desert Research and Technology Studies (RATS) geologist crewmembers (2013) Acta Astronaut., 90, pp. 344-355; Garry, W.B., Bleacher, J.E., Field geology conducted from the lunar electric rover, NASA Desert RATS 2009: strategies for human surface operations on the moon (2010) Lunar Planet.

The HIFI pipeline processed data from all HIFI observing modes within the Herschel automated processing environment, as well as, within an interactive environment. A common software framework was developed to best support the use cases required by the instrument teams and by the general astronomers. The HIFI pipeline was built on top of that and was designed with a high degree of modularity. This modular design provided the necessary flexibility and extensibility to deal with the complexity of batch-processing eighteen different observing modes, to support the astronomers in the interactive analysis and to cope with adjustments necessary to improve the pipeline and the quality of the end-products. This approach to the software development and data processing effort was arrived at by coalescing the lessons learned from similar research based projects with the understanding that a degree of foresight was required given the overall length of the project. In this article, both the successes and challenges of the HIFI software development process are presented. To support future similar projects and retain experience gained lessons learned are extracted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Methods: data analysis; Physical sciences and engineering: astronomy; Techniques: spectroscopic","Batch data processing; Computer programming; Data handling; Flocculation; Pipelines; Product design; Quality control; Software design; Spectroscopic analysis; Astronomical observation; Automated processing; Data processing pipelines; Interactive Environments; Methods:data analysis; Physical science; Software development process; Techniques: spectroscopic; Pipeline processing systems",,,,,"Bauer, O.H., Estaria, P., King, K.J., Pilbratt, G.L., Robson, A., Roelfsema, P.R., Schaap, H., FIRST ground segment and science operations concept (1998) Observatory Operations to Optimize Scientific Return, Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series, 3349, pp. 312-318. , Quinn J; Dubbeldam, L., HIFI telemetry packet structure ICD issue 1.11 (2009), https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/12133/996743/HIFI+Telemetry+Packet+Structure+ICD+document/a520fcab-dbb2-446c-9c6c-ded7a8c95715, URL; Gamma, E., Helm, R., Johnson, R., Vlissides, J., Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994), Addison Wesley; de Graauw, T., Helmich, F.P., Phillips, T.G., Stutzki, J., Caux, E., Whyborn, N.D., Dieleman, P., Zwart, F., The Herschel-Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI) (2010) Astron.

The main derived products which are processed nowadays are dehydrated products (egg powder) and the liquid ones (refrigerated or frozen) as well as pasteurized egg mélange which was the studied food in the current research. A number of 20 samples of egg mélange were gathered from two different processing units. Samples were subjected to chemical analysis being determined content in water, dry matter, proteins, lipids, minerals, non-nitrogenous extractive substances, fatty acids and amino acids. Based on the obtained values was realised a nutritional evaluation for the analysed product by calculating the chemical indexes of essential amino acids (CI), essential amino acids index (EAAI), biological value (BV) and nutritional index (NI) for three categories of persons (children, young people and adults). The results of the current study showed the fact that chemically speaking, the analysed pasteurized egg mélange presented values which were into the limits from literature; the analysed samples contented 75.59% water, 24.41% dry matter, 12.22% protein, 9.71% lipids, 0.99% total minerals, 1.48% non-nitrogenous extractive substances, 12.34 g/100 g content in amino acids (5.5 g/100 g essential amino acids) and 22.86 g/100 g lipids for polyunsaturated fatty acids. After nutritional evaluation of proteins from the studied food we observed that those ones had a very close value (EAA=50.77 g/16 g N) to the one of hen egg albumen (51.2 g/16 g N), value which is considered etalon. Calculus of some foresight indicators for nutritional value of proteins from studied egg mélange showed the fact that this one could represent a good source of proteins and implicitly of essential amino acids for humans even if in children’s case the values were a little bit lower and two amino acids (tryptophan and leucine) were slightly limiting. © 2019 SYSCOM 18 S.R.L..

The effect of breast conserving treatment in local recurrence and survival rates for the patients who have multicentric breast cancer is still controversial. In our study, we intended to evaluate the foresight of 84 miRNAs which are identified in breast cancer for having differentiated expressions. Thirty-one patients with unifocal and 26 patients with multicentric breast cancer were included in this study. These tissue samples of both malignant and normal breast tissues were kept in RNA later solution at − 80 °C. Eighty-four miRNAs were studied with miScript miRNA PCR Array Human Breast Cancer kit. Fold change, cut off value was accepted as four. In unifocal group, there were 13 upregulated and five downregulated miRNAs and in multicentric group, there were three upregulated and seven downregulated miRNAs. To reach better results for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, it is important to enlighten tumor biology, and pay attention to target and individual therapy. Thus, miRNAs have potential role in identifying tumor characteristics in supporting diagnosis and resulting with better evaluated disease for better treatment results with individual strategies. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Breast cancer;

Recent genome-mining approaches for the isolation of novel and cryptic NP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have led to the growing interest in NP research communities including Asian NP researchers from China, Japan, and Korea. Recently, a three-nation government-sponsored program named ‘A3 Foresight Network on Chemical and Synthetic Biology of NPs’ has been launched with a goal of establishing an Asian hub for NP research-&-personnel exchange program. This brief commentary describes introduction, main researchers, and future perspective of A3 NP network program. © 2018, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.","A3; Genome mining; Natural product; Streptomyces; Synthetic biology","natural product; biological product; Article; China; drug research; gene cluster; government; human; Japan; Korea; scientist; synthetic biology; chemistry; China; genetics; Japan; metabolism; multigene family; South Korea; Streptomyces; trends; Biological Products; China; Japan; Multigene Family; Republic of Korea; Streptomyces; Synthetic Biology",,"Biological Products",,,"Arakawa, K., Tsuda, N., Taniguchi, A., Kinashi, H., The butenolide signaling molecules SRB1 and SRB2 induce lankacidin and lankamycin production in Streptomyces rochei (2012) ChemBioChem, 13 (10), pp. 1447-1457. , PID: 22761035; Arakawa, K., Manipulation of metabolic pathways controlled by signaling molecules, inducers of antibiotic production, for genome mining in Streptomyces spp (2018) Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek, 111 (5), pp. 743-751. , PID: 29476430; Bachmann, B.O., Van Lanen, S.G., Baltz, R.H., Microbial genome mining for accelerated natural products discovery: is a renaissance in the making?

However, teleoperation can be quite challenging, especially for novice users. Even experienced users may face difficulties or inefficiencies when operating a robot with unfamiliar and/or complex dynamics, such as industrial manipulators or aerial robots, as teleoperation forces users to focus on low-level aspects of robot control, rather than higher level goals regarding task completion, data analysis, and problem solving. We explore how advances in augmented reality (AR) may enable the design of novel teleoperation interfaces that increase operation effectiveness, support the user in conducting concurrent work, and decrease stress. Our key insight is that AR may be used in conjunction with prior work on predictive graphical interfaces such that a teleoperator controls a virtual robot surrogate, rather than directly operating the robot itself, providing the user with foresight regarding where the physical robot will end up and how it will get there. We present the design of two AR interfaces using such a surrogate: one focused on real-time control and one inspired by waypoint delegation. We compare these designs against a baseline teleoperation system in a laboratory experiment in which novice and expert users piloted an aerial robot to inspect an environment and analyze data. Our results revealed that the augmented reality prototypes provided several objective and subjective improvements, demonstrating the promise of leveraging AR to improve human-robot interactions. © 2019 IEEE.","aerial robots; ARHMD; augmented reality; drones; interface design; mixed reality; Robots; teleoperation","Antennas; Augmented reality; Drones; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Industrial manipulators; Machine design; Man machine systems; Manipulators; Mixed reality; Problem solving; Real time control; Remote control; Robots; Aerial robots; ARHMD; Graphical interface; Interface designs; Laboratory experiments; Robot teleoperation; Teleoperation interface; Teleoperation systems; Human robot interaction",,,,,"Taylor, R.H., Menciassi, A., Fichtinger, G., Fiorini, P., Dario, P., Medical robotics and computer-integrated surgery (2016) Springer Handbook of Robotics, pp. 1657-1684; Nudehi, S.S., Mukherjee, R., Ghodoussi, M., A haptic interface design for minimally invasive telesurgical training and collaboration in the presence of time delay (2003) Decision and Control, 2003.

Especially modulating heat pumps are suitable for using intelligent control strategies that vary the pumps’ power output based on demand response signals. In this paper, we define optimization problems for minimizing the heating costs and the surplus energy of a residential area, and we introduce novel heuristic control strategies for modulating heat pumps to solve these problems. The heuristic control strategies make use of a privacy preserving control and communication architecture that combines central and decentralized control approaches. All buildings use an underfloor heating system and a domestic hot water tank as thermal storages. Compared to a conventional control strategy, the results show average cost reductions of between 4.1% and 13.3% for the cost minimization heuristics, and average improvements of between 38.3% and 52.6% for the surplus energy minimization heuristic. Contrary to approaches for finding the globally optimal solution, the introduced heuristic control strategies have significantly lower computational times and do not require perfect foresight regarding future demands and electricity generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Control and communication architecture; Demand response; Heuristic control strategy; Modulating heat pumps; Smart grid; Thermal storages","Cost reduction; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Optimization; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Water tanks; Communication architectures; Demand response; Heuristic control; Modulating heat pumps; Smart grid; Thermal storage; Decentralized control; alternative energy; control system; demand analysis; energy storage; heating; heuristics; optimization; residential location; smart grid; storage tank",,,,,"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8612324/8-25012018-AP-EN.pdf/9d28caef-1961-4dd1-a901-af18f121fb2d, Renewable energy in the EU: Share of renewables in energy consumption in the EU reached 17% in 2016 [25 January 2018].

Under perfect foresight, the first effect makes Sudden Stops milder and multiple equilibria harder to obtain. The three effects add an “intermediation externality” to the macroprudential externality of standard models, which is present even without credit constraints. Optimal policy under commitment can be decentralized equally by taxing domestic credit or capital inflows, and hence capital controls as a separate instrument are not justified. This optimal policy is time inconsistent and follows a complex, nonlinear schedule. Quantitatively, an optimized pair of constant taxes on domestic debt and capital inflows makes crises slightly less likely and yields a small welfare gain, but other pairs reduce welfare sharply. For high effective debt taxes, capital controls and domestic debt taxes are again equivalent, and for low ones, welfare is higher with higher taxes on domestic debt than on capital inflows. © 2018, International Monetary Fund.",,,,,,,"Benigno, G., Chen, H., Otrok, C., Rebucci, A., Young, E.R., Optimal capital controls and real exchange rate policies: A pecuniary externality perspective (2016) Journal of Monetary Economics, 84, pp. 147-165; Bianchi, J., Overborrowing and systemic externalities in the business cycle (2011) American Economic Review, 101 (7), pp. 3400-3426; Bianchi, J., Liu, C., Mendoza, E.G., Fundamentals news, global liquidity and macroprudential policy (2016) Journal of International Economics, 99 (1), pp. 2-15; Bianchi, J., Mendoza, E.G., Optimal time-consistent macroprudential policy (2018) Journal of Political Economy, 126 (2), pp. 588-634; Calvo, G., On dollarization (2002) Economics of Transition, 10 (2), pp. 393-403; Céspedes, L., Chang, R., Velasco, A., Balance sheets and exchange rate policy (2004) American Economic Review, 94 (4), pp. 1183-1193; Choi, W., Cook, D., Liability dollarization and the bank balance sheet channel (2004) Journal of International Economics, 64 (2), pp. 247-275; Díaz-Alejandro, C.F., (1965) Exchange-rate devaluation in a semi-industrialized country: The experience of Argentina, 1955–1961, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Eichengreenhausmann, B.R., (1999) Exchange rates and financial fragility, , NBER Working Paper No. 7418; Hernández, J., Mendoza, E.G., Optimal v. simple financial policy rules in a production economy with “liability dollarization (2017) Ensayos sobre Política Económica, 35 (82), pp. 25-39; Korinek, A., The new economics of prudential capital controls: A research agenda (2011) IMF Economic Review, 59 (3), pp. 523-561; Lane, P., Milesi-Ferretti, G., The external wealth of nations: Measures of foreign assets and liabilities for industrial and developing countries (2001) Journal of International Economics, 55 (2), pp. 263-294; Ljungqvist, L., Sargent, T., (2004) Recursive macroeconomic theory, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Mendoza, E.G., Credit, prices, and crashes: Business cycles with a sudden stop (2002) Preventing Currency Crises in Emerging Markets, pp. 335-392. , Frankel Jeffrey A, Edwards Sebastian, (eds), University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Mendoza, E.G., Real exchange volatility and the price of nontradables in sudden-stop prone economies (2005) Economia, pp. 103-148. , Fall; Mendoza, E.G., Rojas, E., (2017) Liability dollarization, sudden stops and optimal financial policy, , Mimeo, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Mendoza, E.G., Sudden stops, financial crises, and leverage (2010) The American Economic Review, 100 (5), pp. 1941-1966; Mendoza, E.G., (2016) Macroprudential policy: Promise and challenges, , NBER Working Paper No. 22868; Obstfeld, M., Rogoff, K., (1996) Foundations of international macroeconomics, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Salter, W., Internal and external balance: The role of price and expenditure effects (1959) Economic Record, 35 (71), pp. 226-238; Schmitt-Grohé, S., Uribe, M., Adjustment to small, large, and sunspot shocks in open economies with stock collateral constraints (2017) Ensayos sobre Política Económica, 35 (82), pp. 2-9; Schmitt-Grohé, S., Uribe, M., (2018) Multiple equilibria in open economy models with collateral constraints: Overborrowing revisited, , Mimeo, Columbia University, New York; Swan, T., Economic control in a dependent economy (1960) Economic Record, 36 (73), pp. 51-66; Tauchen, G., Hussey, R., Quadrature-based methods for obtaining approximate solutions to nonlinear asset pricing models (1991) Econometrica, 59, pp. 371-396","Mendoza, E.G.; University of PennsylvaniaUnited States; email: egme@sas.upenn.edu",,,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",,,,,20414161,,,,"English","IMF Econ.Rev.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057347595

Since the 1980s, programs for this purpose have existed, one of which is the California POST Command College. Command College is an academically oriented executive development program intended to “invest in the future” as its students – mid-career police managers – acquire the tools and skills necessary to be promoted to executive positions. This paper aims to answer the question, “Does the Command College achieve its intended goals?” Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument was used to obtain perspectives of recent graduates and of those who had graduated from the program more than four years before the survey. An assessment of the frequency of promotions to command and executive roles was completed, and an external academic assessment of the program’s curriculum was completed by a university. Findings: Support for the program by graduates increased over time, graduates were promoted at a rate of three times higher than baseline averages for police managers and the program’s curriculum was vetted as being equivalent to graduate-level courses at the university level. Research limitations/implications: As its value is validated through this assessment, others can learn how they might better prepare their police executives for the future. No similar law enforcement program has been similarly assessed, so others may also learn ways to ensure they are achieving their intended outcomes from this example. Given the differences in other law enforcement leadership programs in terms of student selection and specific goals, direct comparisons would be limited, both by the program differences and the research design used by others as they work to validate their success in meeting their goals. Originality/value: Although law enforcement executive education has existed since 1935, and leadership training programs for the police since 1982, no research has been conducted to validate the outcomes and impact of such programs on the graduates of such programs and their agencies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Command college; Executive development; Foresight; Futures; Law enforcement; Leadership",,,,,,"Barling, J., Weber, T., Kelloway, E., Effects of transformational leadership training on attitudinal and financial outcomes: a field experiment (1996) Journal of Applied Psychology, 81 (6), pp. 827-832; Burke, M., Day, R., A cumulative study of the effectiveness of managerial training (1986) Journal of Applied Psychology, 71 (2), pp. 232-245; (2017) Population rankings, , www.cacities.org/Resources/Learn-About-Cities/2011Cities-by-Population.aspx, (accessed: 23 June 2017; (1982) California law enforcement command college report, , CA Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST), Commission meeting, Agenda Item H, 28 January; (2017) Report on request to renew the contract for the law enforcement command college, , CA Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Commission Agenda Report, 22 February; Davis, R., Iyengar, R., (2013) Evaluation of the caruth police institute at dallas, , www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR312.html, (accessed, RAND Corporation, Safety and Justice Program: 18 June 2017; Einstein, A., As quoted in ‘What life means to Einstein: an interview by George Sylvester viereck (1929) The Saturday Evening Post, , 26 October; (2017) National academy website, , www.fbi.gov/services/training-academy/national-academy, (accessed: 2 July 2017; (2017) Confidence in police back at historical average, , www.gallup.com/poll/213869/confidence-police-back-historical-average.aspx, (accessed, 10 June: 22 June 2017; Harrison, B., (2015) Why should cops study the future?, pp. 22-24. , FBI National Academy Associates Magazine, January-February; Harrison, B., An assessment of the command college (2017) Unpublished research report for CA Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training (POST), , Sacramento, CA: July; Lieberman, P., (1989) Command college: pointing cops toward the 21st century, , http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-25/news/mn-169_1_command-college, Los Angeles Times, 25 September; (1996) US department of justice, LEAA/OJP retrospective (1996), , www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/164509.pdf, (accessed: 30 June 2017; (2017) Public trust in government: 1958-2017, , www.people-press.org/2017/05/03/public-trust-in-government-1958-2017/, (accessed, 14 December, 12 June 2017; (2017) Roughly one-in-five police frequently feel angry and frustrated on the job, , www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/09/roughly-one-in-five-police-frequently-feel-angry-and-frustrated-on-the-job/, (accessed, 9 March: 22 June 2017; (2016) Report of police department staffing, , http://sfbos.org/appendix-1-management-staffing-and-supervision-sworn-personnel, (accessed, January: 23 June 2017; Sharpe, B., (2013) Three Horizons: The Patterning of Hope, , Triarchy Press, Bridport; (2018) Law enforcement command certificate, , https://pce.sandiego.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=44176092&selectedProgramAreaId=44116951&selectedProgramStreamId, (accessed: 1 July 2018; (1931) Report on lawlessness in law enforcement, Part 1, , www.lexisnexis.com/documents/academic/upa_cis/1965_WickershamCommPt1.pdf, (accessed, Wickersham Commission Report: 27 June 2018; Wilson, O.W., August vollmer (1953) Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology & Police Science, 44, pp. 91-103. , https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4112&context=jclc, (accessed: 28 June 2017","Harrison, B.; ER Harrison and Associates, IncUnited States; email: bobharrison@cox.net",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,10748121,,,,"English","Horizon",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061702234

This paper aims to review reasons to believe computation will continue to become faster in the future, the economic consequences of speedups and how these affect risk, ethics and governance. Design/methodology/approach: A brief review of science and trends followed by an analysis of consequences. Findings: Current computation is far from the physical limits in terms of processing speed. Algorithmic improvements may be equally powerful but cannot easily be predicted or bounded. Communication and sensing is already at the physical speed limits, although improvements in bandwidth will likely be significant. The value in these speedups lies in productivity gains, timeliness, early arrival of results and cybernetic feedback shifts. However, time compression can lead to loss of control owing to inability to track fast change, emergent or systemic risk and asynchrony. Speedups can also exacerbate inequalities between different agents and reduce safety if there are competitive pressures. Fast decisions are potentially not better decisions, as they may be made on little data. Social implications: The impact on society and the challenge to governance are likely to be profound, requiring adapting new methods for managing fast-moving and technological risks. Originality/value: The speed with which events happen is an important aspect of foresight, not just as a subject of prediction or analysis, but also as a driver of the kinds of dynamics that are possible. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ethics",,,,,,"Amdahl, G.M., Validity of the single processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities (1967) Proceedings of the April 18-20, 1967, Spring Joint Computer Conference, pp. 483-485. , ACM; Armstrong, S., Bostrom, N., Shulman, C., Racing to the precipice: a model of artificial intelligence development (2016) AI & Society, 31 (2), pp. 201-206; Ashwin, P., Wieczorek, S., Vitolo, R., Cox, P., Tipping points in open systems: bifurcation, noise-induced and rate-dependent examples in the climate system (2012) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 370 (1962), pp. 1166-1184; Bekenstein, J.D., Universal upper bound on the entropy-to-energy ratio for bounded systems (1981) Physical Review D, 23 (2), p. 287; Bostrom, N., (2014) Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bostrom, N., Douglas, T., Sandberg, A., The unilateralist’s curse and the case for a principle of conformity (2016) Social Epistemology, 30 (4), pp. 350-371; Collingridge, D., (1982) The Social Control of Technology, , Palgrave; Cowen, T., (2011) The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better, , Penguin, Dutton; Ctistis, G., Yuce, E., Hartsuiker, A., Claudon, J., Bazin, M., Gérard, J.M., Vos, W.L., Ultimate fast optical switching of a planar microcavity in the telecom wavelength range (2011) Applied Physics Letters, 98 (16), p. 161114; Danaher, J., The threat of algocracy: reality, resistance and accommodation (2016) Philosophy & Technology, 29 (3), pp. 245-268; Denning, P.J., Lewis, T.G., Exponential laws of computing growth (2016) Communications of the ACM, 60 (1), pp. 54-65; Drexler, K.E., (1992) Nanosystems.

This paper assesses biofuels technology readiness and developments to provide foresight to biofuels development in Southern Africa. Efficient conversion pathways, coupled with biomass from waste or high-yielding energy crops, will reduce both the costs of biofuels production, and the environmental impacts. Compared to petroleum fuels, the current commercial biofuels (ethanol, biogas and biodiesel) typically offer carbon emission reductions of 30–50% but are marginally more expensive. The extent of biofuels market penetration will therefore be influenced by mandates (blending targets) and subsidies (green premium). Advanced biofuels promise greater efficiencies and carbon emission reductions at reduced cost but will require further research and development to reach commercialisation. If developed appropriately, biofuels can reduce carbon emissions and improve energy security, while enabling sustainable agriculture and improved natural resources management. © 2018, © 2018 UNU-WIDER.

Previous research in this area has applied game theory to understand social dilemmas and inform policy initiatives. However, considerations of the “evolving structure” of natural resource games over time and agents' planning horizon raises the complexity of game analysis substantially and has often been overlooked. We analyze a simple model of an irrigation system shared by two users and consider how players will act under different levels of foresight. Without foresight into game changes over time, players are blind to the fact that they are in a game of chicken. We model agents with foresight by interconnecting games across time and show how this creates opportunities for “strategic loss” early on, allowing players with foresight to reduce total costs. High future costs can thus be avoided with foresight if the rising costs of inaction are made apparent. We consider the effect of discounting and differences between players to provide policy recommendations regarding incentives for foresight. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Building on the Ricoeurian notion of distentio- ‘the stretching of consciousness through simultaneous attention to memory and expectation’, we develop the concept of distentive capability as a spatio-temporal process of ‘way-finding’ that sustains the creative emergence of strategic foresight across multiple time horizons. Emphasizing narratives as the site of strategic foresight, we draw on tropes taken from three of the most popular speeches delivered by Steve Jobs, the American information technology entrepreneur, inventor and founder of Apple Inc. to illustrate how distentive capability as played out in the reassembling of the past, the present and the future, stretched out in time, may contribute to the identification of potentialities and limits for strategic action.

In the effectual process, entrepreneurs reject any attempt to predict or forecast the future which would allow them to define their new ventures. Instead, they concentrate on building the future through their action and interaction with the different actors in their environment. The same attitude towards the future can be found in the literature on foresight. However, until now, these two concepts have not been brought together. The proposed paper is based on an exploratory study. Through a review of the literature on both effectuation and foresight, we aim to shed some light on the implicit links between the two concepts: cognition and networks. In addition, through a series of semi-conducted interviews with both entrepreneurs and some leading figures from the field of foresight, we explore this relationship more deeply. The results from the interviews suggest new approaches that could further strengthen the relationship between effectuation and foresight. This study opens a number of new perspectives for building foresight approaches that would be more adapted for entrepreneurs, notably in the initial stages of the development of their projects, as well as some possibilities for possible future research developments. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Cognition; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship; Foresight; Networks","Networks (circuits); Technological forecasting; Cognition; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship; Exploratory studies; Foresight; New approaches; Possible futures; Research development; entrepreneur; research",,,,,"Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Innovation system foresight (2014) Technol.

Firstly, we underline that KM is approaching a stage of maturity that requires continuing efforts to use theoretical and empirical investigation to question its future evolution, through a foresight reflection. In parallel, we show that the link between knowledge management and foresight is of long-standing concern. In the context of a knowledge-based economy, this connection has taken on a structuring dimension. Thus, the purpose of this TFSC special issue is two-fold. On the one hand, we seek to explore the impacts of foresight on knowledge management and to understand its cognitive dimensions. And, on the other hand, we cast a future-oriented eye on knowledge management both as a set of practices and a research field. Finally, we present an overview of the topics covered by the selected papers. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Knowledge management; Organizational learning","Knowledge based systems; Cognitive dimensions; Empirical investigation; Foresight; Knowledge based economy; Organizational learning; Research fields; Theory and practice; Knowledge management; cognition; empirical analysis; future prospect; knowledge; learning; management; theoretical study",,,,,"Amin, A., Cohendet, P., Architectures of Knowledge.

Policy actions affected the past, but are very difficult to foresee. Among those that most shaped global food systems in the last half century are measures that fostered productivity growth, expansion of trade, and the interlinkage of agricultural and environmental policies. Scenarios for global food systems, including those using the quantitative tools of the CGIAR's Global Futures and Strategic Foresight modeling approach, explore alternative assumptions in these three areas, among others.

The analysis is based on around forty foresight projects conducted by the CNAM community of practice in the last ten years or so, based on the typology proposed by Bootz (2003) and Bootz and Monti (2008). The aim is twofold: first, we test the robustness of the initial typology and, second, we examine global developments in foresight practices through an analysis of their cognitive aspects. The examination of present practice led to the typology being refined, and demonstrates how its impact on organizational learning has been extended. It also shows how discussion has evolved through networks that are more open to the outside world and closer to action, with measures and tools adopted to promote greater flexibility. These changes may be partially explained by the emergence of the knowledge economy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Knowledge management; Organizational learning","Technological forecasting; Cognitive aspects; Community of practice; Comprehensive analysis; Foresight; Global development; Knowledge economy; Organizational learning; Knowledge management; knowledge based system; learning; management practice; organization; France",,,,,"Alavi, M., Kayworth, T.R., Leidner, D.E., An empirical examination of the influence of organizational culture on knowledge management practices (2005) J.

In value-laden areas such as public health and healthcare, deliberative scenario methods are clearly needed. For the sixth Dutch Public Health Status and Forecasts-report (PHSF-2014), a new approach of co-creation was developed aiming to incorporate different societal norms and values in the description of possible future developments. The major future trends in the Netherlands were used as a starting point for a deliberative dialogue with stakeholders to identify the most important societal challenges for public health and healthcare. Four societal challenges were identified: 1) To keep people healthy as long as possible and cure illness promptly, 2) To support vulnerable people and enable social participation, 3) To promote individual autonomy and freedom of choice, and 4) To keep health care affordable. Working with stakeholders, we expanded these societal challenges into four corresponding normative scenarios. In a survey the normative scenarios were found to be recognizable and sufficiently distinctive. We organized meetings with experts to explore how engagement and policy strategies in each scenario would affect the other three societal challenges. Possible synergies and trade-offs between the four scenarios were identified. Public health foresight based on a business-as-usual scenario and normative scenarios is clearly practicable. The process and the outcomes support and elucidate a wide range of strategic discussions in public health. © 2018 The Authors","Foresight; Normative scenarios; Population health; Public health; Public involvement; The Netherlands","article; freedom; human; Netherlands; population health; public health; social participation; vulnerable population",,,,,"Parker, L., Including values in evidence-based policy making for breast screening: an empirically grounded tool to assist expert decision makers (2017) Health Policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands), 121 (7), pp. 793-799; Liverani, M., Hawkins, B., Parkhurst, J.O., Political and institutional influences on the use of evidence in public health policy.

Using a structural foresight modeling approach, this paper examines past, present, and future trends of fish supply and demand in Africa to highlight challenges and prospects of the fish sector's contribution to food security in the continent. If historical trends are maintained, growth of aquaculture and fisheries would be slow, resulting in declining per capita fish consumption. Alternative scenarios highlight the potential importance of African aquaculture development in addressing food security. Policies to promote sustainable aquaculture, reduce post-harvest losses, and facilitate fish trade are indispensable. Fish deserves more attention in food and nutrition policies due to its prominence in the African food basket. © 2018 The Authors","Africa; Aquaculture; Fisheries; Food security; Foresight modeling; Policy",,,,,,"Affognon, H., Mutungi, C., Sanginga, P., Borgemeister, C., Unpacking postharvest losses in Sub-Saharan Africa: a meta-analysis (2015) World Dev., 66, pp. 49-68; (2011), African Development Bank Africa in Fifty Year's Time: The Road Towards Inclusive Growth.

In the context of large-scale energy transitions, analytical approaches are often narrowly constrained around techno-economic, political and environmental aspects as drivers of change. Discussing renewable energy technologies in the context of an increasingly omnipresent peer-to-peer logic and the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) underscore the role of cultural change as a potential game changer. This paper focuses on the different modes and implications of peer-to-peer principles, as a means of organizing social interaction, assumed to have an increasingly important role in forthcoming energy transitions. In addition to these novel organisational principles, circular economy aspirations are gaining strength. Taken together, these socio-technical imaginaries can be interpreted as possibly converging building blocks for a desirable future society. Assuming a systems thinking view, this paper presents the key findings of foresight work. Such issues were discussed in a futures workshop organised in June 2018 in Finland, with the Millennium Project, a global futures think tank. The workshop explored the possible interactions of decentralised renewable energy, peer-to-peer and circular economy. The workshop results reflect new opportunities, risks, and the potential impacts of identified developments. The results indicate that synergetic advantages can be demonstrated, although a few notable caveats remain on the convergence of emerging peer-to-peer practices with circular economy. Furthermore, relevance to other geographic regions warrants urgent attention. © 2019 cape peninsula university of technology.","Circular economy; Electrification; Foresight; Peer-to-peer; Risk analysis; Socio-technical imaginary","Industry 4.0; Renewable energy resources; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Circular economy; Electrification; Foresight; Peer to peer; Sociotechnical; Industrial economics",,,,,"Raleigh, B., Nicolas-Heinonen, S., Entangling and elevating creativity and criticality in participatory futuring engagements (2018) World Futures Review, , https://doi.org/10.1177/1946756718807014; Bauwens, M., The political economy of peer production (2005) CTheory J, , http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499, Accessed September 21, 2016; Bauwens, M., Peer-to-peer governance, democracy and economic vision: P2p as a way of living-part 2 (2007) P2P Foundation., 27 (10). , https://www.masternewmedia.org/information_access/p2p-peer-to-peereconomy/peer-to-peer-governance-production-property-part-2-Michel-Bauwens-20071020.htm, 2007; Bauwens, M., The peer to peer manifesto: The emergence of p2p civilization and political economy (2007) P2P Foundation, , http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2007/11/03/the_peer_to_peer_manifesto.htm, 3. 11. 2007; Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of Futures Studies: Human Science for A New Era, Volume 1: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, New Jersey 1997; Benkler, Y., Peer production, the commons, and the future of the firm (2017) Strat.

We ran an experiment with 79 students and 43 questions in 2015 and 2016, where the treatment subgroup received the assembled elite feedback, and the control subgroup received statistics based on all panellists.

In fact businesses have to be embedded in the technology in order to be competitive. This paper focuses on how Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) will come up with the customer engagement technology in leveraging competitive advantage and remain customer centric organization. Challenges and complexities have doubled. Social media and big data have been in fore front in cruising business direction and pathways. SMEs also face the dilemma of budget, digitalization, strategic plan, growth etc. How SME’s will harness customer engagement technology with limited resources and capacity constraints. Strategic foresight backed by dynamic of business model best suited has to be saddled and galloped. The question is do SME’s are facing the music of a disturbed or disruptive milieu. Also, SME’s need to be innovative and agile in their business operations. Off late, in a macro environment especially, technology has made the difference in gauging the performance of businesses. SME’s also needed to explore experiment and engage various business models and shortlist the most suitable one. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

Nanotechnology is an innovative scientific field with many potential societal benefits but also high uncertainty about risks to human health and the environment. This study is based on a survey distributed to a sample of 237 expert stakeholders in Sweden working in the field of nanotechnology innovation and regulation. The sample comprises experts in both industry and government organizations. The paper explores the expert’s assessment of benefits, risks, and their views of nanotechnology regulation. The experts generally agreed on the need for further regulation of nanotechnology, although they differed in their support for different regulatory measures. Support for government regulation was increased by greater perceived risk and by ethical concerns, while perceived benefit decreased support for government regulation. If nanotechnology was important for the respondent’s organization of affiliation, support for government regulation decreased. Experts in government organizations were more in favor of stronger government regulation, perceived higher risks, and were more concerned about the ethical implications of nanotechnology than were the industry experts. While previous research has discussed views of experts, as well as comparing the attitudes of the general public with experts, this study contributes to the field by analyzing and identifying differences between industry experts and experts working in government. © 2019, The Author(s).","Experts; Nanotechnology; Regulations; Risk perception; Risk psychology; Stakeholders","Health risks; Laws and legislation; Nanotechnology; Philosophical aspects; Risk assessment; Ethical implications; Experts; Government organizations; Government regulation; Multi-disciplinary research; Perceived benefits; Regulations; Stakeholders; Risk perception; article; controlled study; government regulation; human; interdisciplinary research; nanotechnology; organization; perception; psychology; risk assessment; Sweden; uncertainty",,,,,"Anderson, B., Hope for nanotechnology: anticipatory knowledge and the governance of affect (2007) Area, 39 (2), pp. 156-165; Apostolakis, G.E., Pickett, S.E., Deliberation: integrating analytical results into environmental decisions involving multiple stakeholders (1998) Risk Anal, 18 (5), pp. 621-634; Bainbridge, W.S., Public attitudes toward nanotechnology (2002) J Nanopart Res, 4 (6), pp. 561-570; Beaudrie, C.E., Kandlikar, M., Satterfield, T., From cradle-to-grave at the nanoscale: gaps in US regulatory oversight along the nanomaterial life cycle (2013) Environ Sci Technol, 47 (11), pp. 5524-5534; Bertoldo, R., Mays, C., Poumadère, M., Schneider, N., Svendsen, C., Great deeds or great risks?

The degree of digitalisation and its consequences are challenging to understand because most people lack first-hand experience of what digitalisation actually feels like. Digitalisation is abstract and difficult to grasp, which leads to a detached sense of the digital surroundings. In this paper, we argue that in order to grasp the nature and future of a digitalised society, an embodied understanding of digitalisation is needed. Such an understanding should utilise ways of knowing other than rational thinking, challenge existing narratives and move from preparing for the future to exploring novelty. We focus on the importance of a broader understanding of digitalisation within the field of education and discuss how a more diverse view is essential to empower people to take part in a digitalised society. We use the concept of ‘digi-grasping’ to analyse awareness and involvement in the digital world. By digi-grasping we mean active sense-making and existing in a world that consists of both a digital and a physical world. We argue that through ‘grasping’ the digital world it is possible to create an ethical and aesthetic attachment to society. Digi-grasping can empower people to understand and question the choices and motivations behind current digital structures and create new structures. It is thus an important approach to shaping the futures of digital society. We illustrate the concept with examples representing different modes of being and doing at the interface of the digital and physical. © 2018 The Authors","Art education; Artistic research; Craft education; Critical theory; Digital society; Digitalisation; Embodied learning; Experiential foresight","algorithm; art; conceptual framework; digitization; educational development; experimental study; future prospect; research work",,,,,"Ailisto, H., Collin, J., Juhanko, J., Mäntylä, M., Onko Suomi jäämässä alustatalouden junasta?

We assume control is distributed between a global controller (GC) and local controllers (LCs) located at the nodes with storage units. Each LC has access to its most recent net load data and runs at every time step while the GC has delayed data due to smart meter infrastructure or communication network delay, hence runs less frequently. We describe three control schemes: 1) direct storage controller (DSC) in which the GC computes the storage control signals for an upcoming window and the LCs directly use these signals; 2) net load following controller (NLFC) in which the GC computes a net load profile for each node and each LC tries to track its set profile; and 3) nodal slack controller (NSC) in which the GC computes upper and lower bounds on the net load at each node and the LC optimizes the local control action constrained by these bounds. We use a radial network with real load data to compare the performance of these schemes based on arbitrage profit and maximum solar penetration relative to a perfect foresight controller. We find that NSC and NLFC increase the supported maximum solar penetration to 29% and 40%, respectively, as compared to 10% for DSC. Moreover, NSC is able to capture 90.7% of the available arbitrage profits which is significantly higher than that achievable with NLFC and DSC. © 2017 IEEE","Control systems; Distributed generation; Energy storage","Constrained optimization; Constraint satisfaction problems; Control systems; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Distributed power generation; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Electric load management; Energy storage; Interactive computer systems; Profitability; Quality control; Random processes; Real time systems; Smart meters; Stochastic systems; Telecommunication networks; Delays; Distributed database; Distributed energy storages; Distributed storage; Load modeling; Renewable distributed generations; Storage controllers; Upper and lower bounds; Controllers",,,,,"Annual energy outlook 2014 with projections to 2040 (2014) Energy Inf, , http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/0383(2014).pdf, Admin., U.S. Dept.

One of the main concern is the safety of these commercial vehicle during accidents. This research paper presents the idea of a Vehicle Accident Foresight System (VAFS). Accident datasets for VAFS are based on actual vehicle accident datasets extracted from open-source datasets. VAFS aims to analyze past accident data using the random forest algorithm to analyze and predict future accidents. One thousand decision trees are used in implementation. The implemented prototype consists of a dashboard which can specify accident locations according to time, it can also identify the elements which contribute the most to accident severity. The prediction model of VAFS has a minimum accuracy of 69% and a maximum accuracy of 100%. © 2018 IEEE.","Accident; Datasets; Insurance; Precognition; Random forest algorithm; Vehicle","Automobiles; Commercial vehicles; Decision trees; Distributed computer systems; Insurance; Vehicles; Accident location; Accident severity; Datasets; Maximum accuracies; Precognition; Prediction model; Random forest algorithm; Vehicle accidents; Accidents",,,,,"Bijoy, C.L.W., Thampi, V., Novel application of Random Forest Scripps Institution of Oceanography, , https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/documents/STM/2013-10/27_Bijoy_Random_Forest.pdf; Osmconvert Openstreetmap, , https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert; (2018) Python Data Analysis Library, , https://pandas.pydata.org, 2 May; Polamuri, S., (2017) HOW the RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM WORKS in MACHINE LEARNING, , https://dataaspirant.com/2017/05/22/random-forestalgorithm-machine-learing/, 22 May; Koehrsen, W., (2017) Random Forest Simple Explanation, , https://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen/randomforest-simple-explanation-377895a60d2d, 27 December; Machine Learning in Python, , http://scikit-learn.org/stable/; Dash Tutorial - Part 2: Interactivity, , https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started-part-2; Python Plotting, , https://matplotlib.org; https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safetydata; https://www.wunderground.com; Sadek, S., Al-Hamadi, A., Michaelis, B., Sayed, U., (2010) Real-time Automatic Traffic Accident Recognition Using HFG, p. 1. , https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/628f/903e7ab302d0af3541d2e59181779474f6c0.pdf, [online] Magdeburg; Xu, Q., Mak, T., Ko, J., Sengupta, R., (2004) Vehicle-to-vehicle Safety Messaging in DSRC, p. 19. , ACM Press; Nandan, A., Das, S., Pau, G., Gerla, M., Sanadidi, M.Y., Co-operative downloading in vehicular ad-hoc wireless networks, in (2005) Second Annual Conference on Wireless On-demand Network Systems and Services, 2005.

Humans can imagine both the solution to a problem and the stages along the way [1–3], such as when we plan one or two moves ahead in chess. The extent to which other animals can do the same is far less clear [4–25]. Here, we presented New Caledonian crows with a series of metatool problems where each stage was out of sight of the others and the crows had to avoid either a distractor apparatus containing a non-functional tool or a non-functional apparatus containing a functional tool. Crows were able to mentally represent the sub-goals and goals of metatool problems: crows kept in mind the location and identities of out-of-sight tools and apparatuses while planning and performing a sequence of tool behaviors. This provides the first conclusive evidence that birds can plan several moves ahead while using tools. Gruber et al. presented metatool problems to New Caledonian crows, where each stage of the problem was out of sight of the others. Crows had to mentally represent the location and identities of tools and apparatuses to solve the problems correctly. These results show that New Caledonian crows can preplan several behaviors ahead while using tools. © 2019 The Authors","corvids; foresight; mental representation; metatool use; New Caledonian crow; planning",,,,,,"Ward, G., Allport, A., Planning and Problem solving Using the Five disc Tower of London Task (1997) Q.

However, we rarely know how the future will transpire when undertaking infrastructure planning. A key uncertainty that has yet to be studied in this context is building-level energy demand. Energy demand varies stochastically on a daily basis, owing to activities and weather. Yet, most current district optimisation models consider only the average demand. Studies that incorporate demand uncertainty ignore the temporal autocorrelation of energy demand, or require a detailed engineering model for which there is no validation against real consumption data. In this paper, we propose a new 3-step methodology for handling demand uncertainty in mixed integer linear programming models of district energy systems. The three steps are: scenario generation, scenario reduction, and scenario optimisation. Our proposed framework is data-centric, based on sampling of historic demand data using multidimensional search spaces. 500 scenarios are generated from the historical demand of multiple buildings, requiring historical data to be nonparametrically sampled whilst maintaining interdependence of hourly demand in a day. Using scenario reduction, we are able to select a subset of scenarios that best represent the probability distribution of our large number of initial scenarios. The scenario optimisation step constitutes minimising the cost of technology investment and operation, where all realisations of demand from the reduced scenarios are probabilistically weighted in the objective function. We applied these three steps to a real district development in Cambridge, UK, and an illustrative district in Bangalore, India. Our results show that the technology investment portfolios derived from our 3-step methodology are more robust in meeting large possible variations in demand than any model optimised independently with a single demand scenario. This increased robustness comes at a higher monetary cost of investment. However, the high investment cost is lower than the highest possible cost when each of the initial 500 scenarios is optimised independently. In both our case studies, building level energy systems are always more robust than district level ones, a result which disagrees with many existing studies. The outcomes enable better examination of district energy systems. In addition, our methodology is compiled as an open-source code that can be applied to optimise existing and future energy masterplans of districts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Data-driven demand; District energy systems; Mixed integer linear optimisation; Scenario optimisation; Scenario reduction","Binary alloys; Costs; Data handling; Economics; Energy management; Integer programming; Open source software; Open systems; Potassium alloys; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Technology transfer; Uranium alloys; Data driven; District energy systems; Infrastructure planning; Mixed integer linear programming model; Multidimensional search; Optimisations; Scenario reductions; Technology investments; Investments; data assimilation; demand analysis; energy efficiency; infrastructure planning; investment; linear programing; optimization; probability; scenario analysis; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; Bengaluru; Cambridge [Massachusetts]; India; Karnataka; Massachusetts; United States",,,,,"Morvaj, B., Evins, R., Carmeliet, J., Optimising urban energy systems: simultaneous system sizing, operation and district heating network layout (2016) Energy, 116 Part 1, pp. 619-636; Li, L., Mu, H., Li, N., Li, M., Economic and environmental optimization for distributed energy resource systems coupled with district energy networks (2016) Energy, 109, pp. 947-960; Omu, A., Choudhary, R., Boies, A., distributed energy resource system optimisation using mixed integer linear programming (2013) Energy Policy, 61, pp. 249-266; Jennings, M., Fisk, D., Shah, N., Modelling and optimization of retrofitting residential energy systems at the urban scale (2014) Energy, 64, pp. 220-233; Mehleri, E.D., Sarimveis, H., Markatos, N.C., Papageorgiou, L.G., A mathematical programming approach for optimal design of distributed energy systems at the neighbourhood level (2012) Energy, 44 (1), pp. 96-104; Buoro, D., Pinamonti, P., Reini, M., Optimization of a distributed cogeneration system with solar district heating (2014) Appl.

Strong GDP and population growth coupled with urbanization trends place tremendous pressures on natural resources and the food systems that are dependent on them. Understanding the impact of these ""mega trends"" is important to identify key leverage points for navigating towards improved nutrition and food security in Nigeria. This paper contributes to the Foresight Project of the Food Systems for Healthier Diets which aims to analyse how the food system in Nigeria is expected to transform in the next decades, and to identify the leverage points for making sure that the transformation contributes to balanced consumer diets. For the food systems foresight, a well-established global economy-wide model, MAGNET, is applied that enables to capture the interlinkages among different food industry players in one consistent framework. By linking MAGNET to the GENUS nutritional database, it is further possible to relate the developments occurring on a macro-level with detailed macro and micronutrient consumption. Model projections suggest that a process of intensification of agriculture in combination with land substitution appears critical for the evolution of food and nutrition security, and for shifts towards healthy diets for the population. Intensification results in greater diversity of the production systems, which in turn cascades into positive effects on the diversity in the food supply and better food security outcomes. © 2019 by the authors.","Agricultural intensification; Baseline projections; CGE model; Diet diversity; Food security; Land substitution; Nutrition","agricultural intensification; baseline survey; dietary intake; economic planning; food consumption; food safety; food security; Gross Domestic Product; land use planning; nutritional status; substitution; trace element; trend analysis; urbanization; Nigeria",,,,,"(2018) World Development Indicators, , World Bank: Washington, DC, USA; (2015) Assessment of Global Land Availability: Land Supply for Agriculture.

Merriam-Webster defines imagination as “the act of forming a mental image of something not present to the senses or never before wholly perceived in reality”; imagination combines “creative ability” and “resourcefulness” [Merriam-Webster (2018) Imagination. Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online. Available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imagination]. This paper considers two interdisciplinary fields in which distinct approaches have sought a solution to the “imagination gap” and have resulted in new research questions, methods, outcomes, and even philosophies. These are science, technology, engineering, arts, math, medicine, and design (STEAMM+D) and Indigenous research that establishes questions and methods from an integrated interdisciplinary worldview and the individual's responsibilities toward community and land. By intertwining these approaches, it is possible for science and society to apply creative problem solving in addressing complex challenges, thereby fostering sustainable innovation. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

This problem is not only hindering the progress of Taiwan's sustainable energy policy but also preventing the energy companies from setting competitive business strategies. This study investigates the key factors affecting the strategy planning for Taiwan's HE development, through a proposed technology foresight based research framework that extends from the introduction of Trends, Uncertainty factors to that of sketching Strategies (named TUS). The TUS inducts literature and specialist's expertise to perform data divergence, information convergence, and factors analysis with the use of Delphi and Theoretical Triangulation. The study result concludes eight key trends, seven key uncertainty factors, and sets six strategies for Taiwan. Furthermore, the demonstrated TUS practice and research findings provide considerable reference beneficial to the extension of future studies associated with HE. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hydrogen economy; Key factor; Strategy planning; Technology foresight; Theoretical triangulation","Energy conservation; Energy policy; Hydrogen fuels; Triangulation; Competitive business; Hydrogen economy; Key factors; Research frameworks; Strategy planning; Sustainable energy policy; Technology foresight; Uncertainty factors; Planning",,,,,"IEA Statistics, CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion highlights: 2017 edition (2017), International Energy Agency; IEA Statistics, Key world energy statistics: 2017 edition (2017), International Energy Agency; http://www.cleanedge.com, Clean Edge, Inc.

Compared with the prior related work in which just one firm can implement such technology, this newly developed adjustment mechanism is endowed with more rationality in the sense that there appear more intelligent firms. It turns out this more rational adjustment mechanism does lead to more convergence to asymmetric equilibrium behavior for a weak foresight ability. Our finding shows that some undesirable complex behavior such as fluctuations and divergent trajectories can be inhibited by increasing the number of such rational firms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adjustment dynamic; Cournot competition; Extrapolative foresight","Computer simulation; Numerical analysis; Adjustment mechanisms; Asymmetric equilibrium; Cournot competition; Cournot duopoly; Extrapolative foresight; Related works; Competition",,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Myran, N.G., White, D.L., Basins of attraction in a Cournot duopoly model of Kopel (2005) J Differ Equ Appl, 11, pp. 879-887; Bischi, G.I., Kopel, M., Equilibrium selection in a nonlinear duopoly game with adaptive expectations (2001) J Econ Behav Organ, 46, pp. 73-100; Bischi, G.I., Lamantia, F., Radi, D., An evolutionary Cournot model with limited market knowledge (2015) J Econ Behav Organ, 116, pp. 219-238; Dawid, H., Heitmann, D., Best response dynamics with level-n expectations in two-stage games (2014) J Econ Dyn Control, 41, pp. 130-153; Fisher, F.M., The stability of the Cournot oligopoly solution: the effects of speeds of adjustment and increasing marginal costs (1961) Rev Econ Stud, 28, pp. 125-135; Friedman, J.W., Mezzetti, C., Bounded rationality, dynamic oligopoly, and conjectural variations (2002) J Econ Behav Organ, 49, pp. 287-306; Gao, X., Zhong, W., Mei, S., Equilibrium stability of a nonlinear heterogeneous duopoly game with extrapolative foresight (2012) Math Comput Simul, 82, pp. 2069-2078; Gao, X., Zhong, W., Mei, S., On local stability of Cournot models with simultaneous and sequential decisions (2012) Math Soc Sci, 63, pp. 207-212; Gao, X., Zhong, W., Mei, S., Nonlinear Cournot oligopoly games with isoelastic demand function: the effects of different behavior rules (2012) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simulat, 17, pp. 5249-5255; Govaertsa, W., Ghaziania, R.K., Stable cycles in a Cournot duopoly model of Kopel (2008) J Comput Appl Math, 218, pp. 247-258; Guse, E.A., Heterogeneous expectations, adaptive learning, and evolutionary dynamics (2010) J Econ Behav Organ, 74, pp. 42-57; Huck, S., Normann, H.T., Oechssler, J., Learning in Cournot oligopoly-an experiment (1999) Econ J, 109, pp. 80-95; Kamalinejad, H., Majda, V.J., Kebriaei, H., Kian, A.R., Cournot games with linear regression expectations in oligopolistic markets (2010) Math Comput Simul, 80, pp. 1874-1885; Kebriaei, H., Rahimi-Kian, A., Ahmadabadi, M.N., Model-based and learning- based decision making in incomplete information Cournot games: a state estimation approach (2015) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Syst, 45, pp. 713-718; Laraki, R., Mertikopoulos, P., Higher order game dynamics (2012) J Econ Theor, 148, pp. 2666-2695; Ma, J., Guo, Z., The influence of information on the stability of a dynamic Bertrand game (2016) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simulat, 30 (1-3), pp. 32-44; Okuguchi, K., The stability of price adjusting oligopoly: the effects of adaptive expectations (1968) South Econ J, 35, pp. 34-36; Quandt, R.E., On the stability of price adjusting oligopoly (1967) South Econ J, 33, pp. 332-336; Shamma, J.S., Arslan, G., Dynamic fictitious play, dynamic gradient play, and distributed convergence to Nash equilibria (2005) IEEE Trans Autom Control, 50, pp. 312-327; Zhang, Y., Mei, S., Zhong, W., Equilibrium selection under evolutionary game dynamics with optimizing behavior (2012) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul, 17, pp. 3719-3726","Zhang, Y.; School of Economics, Nanjing University of Finance & EconomicsChina; email: zyfangsd@126.com",,,"Elsevier B.V.",,,,,10075704,,,,"English","Comm.

The agenda we formulate includes substantial and intellectual priorities concerning intrusive technologies, critical data literacies, labour, co-option, and resistance, and argues for the need for research on these matters, in the interest of audiences. © The Author(s) 2018.","audiences; datafication; foresight; Internet of Things; literacies; users",,,,,,"Ang, I., (1996) Living Room Wars: Rethinking Media Audiences for a Postmodern World, , Psychology Press; Ang, I., Hermes, J., Gender and/ in Media Consumption (1991) Mass Media and Society, pp. 307-328. , Curran James, Gurevitch Michael, (eds), London, Edward Arnold,,. edited by; Ashton, K., That ‘Internet of Things’ Thing (1999) RFID Journal, , http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986, June, 22; Barker, M., I Have Seen the Future and It Is Not Here Yet..; or, on Being Ambitious for Audience Research (2006) The Communication Review, 9 (2), pp. 123-141; Baym, N.K., (2015) Personal connections in the digital age, , US, John Wiley & Sons; Bird, S.E., Are We All Producers Now?

In particular, imitative behavior explains the evidence from experimental oligopolies where the Cournot–Nash equilibrium does not emerge as unique outcome and outputs are placed, for the most part, on fairly competitive levels (see e.g. Apesteguia et al., 2006 and Oechssler et al., 2016). Here, we derive a dynamic model of a linear Cournot oligopoly with a deterministic structure where rational agents having perfect foresight and imitators are present. The Cournot–Nash equilibrium is a stationary state of our models together with a further production level that can be interpreted as the competitive equilibrium in case only imitators are present. We found that the heterogeneities among players influence the stability properties of the Cournot–Nash equilibrium and the arising dynamical scenarios are characterized by similar features as those from experimental outcomes. © 2018 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS)","Dynamic instability; Dynamical systems; Heterogeneity; Imitation","Computation theory; Dynamical systems; Game theory; Stability; Behavioral rules; Competitive equilibrium; Cournot oligopoly; Dynamic instability; Heterogeneity; Imitation; Perfect foresights; Stability properties; Competition",,,,,"Agiza, H.N., Elsadany, A.A., Nonlinear dynamics in the Cournot duopoly game with heterogeneous players (2003) Physica A, 320, pp. 512-524; Agiza, H.N., Elsadany, A.A., Chaotic dynamics in nonlinear duopoly game with heterogeneous players (2004) Appl.

The orthotics and prosthetics (O and P) field of study has great importance alongside other rehabilitation sciences due to its preventive status, therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of key factors and, subsequently, identifying uncertainties to compile and plot a bright and planned future for O and P education system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At first, the key factors seemed to be influential improving the education and training quality of O and P students, were identified, weighted and ranked. All these steps were based on documentations and opinions of elites and deans of O and P through a semi-structured interview. Then, the final list of key factors and extracted drivers was placed and analyzed in cross-impact matrix by MicMac software. RESULTS: Among the initial list of key factors and drivers which identified 45 elements; 19 key factors and drivers scored the highest. Among 238 evaluable relationships in the cross-impact matrix, 123 relationships (51.6% of total matrix volume) are 0, which means that factors do not affect each other and are not affected either. Two key factors were identified as critical uncertainties out of 19 key factors. CONCLUSION: Achieving education development without a dynamic and active planning system is not possible. 'Community-based education' and 'government financial support' were identified as critical uncertainties of O and P future education system. © 2019 Journal of Education and Health Promotion Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Education; foresight; orthotics and prosthetics; uncertainty",,,,,,"Dufva, M., Könnölä, T., Koivisto, R., Multi-layered foresight: Lessons from regional foresight in Chile (2015) Futures, 73, pp. 100-111; Moghimi, A., Future epistemology of theoritical approches to urban planning, artichecter and bulding industry (2015) Urban Manag Q, 14, pp. 75-104; Chermack, T.J., (2011) Scenario Planning in Organizations: How to Create, Use, and Assess Scenarios, , San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers; Ardalan, A., Sohrabizadeh, S., Latifi, M.F., Rajaei, M.H., Asadi, A., Mirbeigi, S., Responding to physical and psychological health impacts of disasters: Case study of the iranian disaster rehabilitation plan (2016) East Mediterr Health J, 22, pp. 212-218; Heinemann, A.W., Bode, R.K., O'Reilly, C., Development and measurement properties of the orthotics and prosthetics users' survey (OPUS): A comprehensive set of clinical outcome instruments (2003) Prosthet Orthot Int, 27, pp. 191-206; (2000) Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, , Engineering Accreditation Commission, Baltimore, MD: Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc; Zali, N., Beheshti, M., Identification of the key factors of regional development approach based on planning scenario (Case Study: Region: East) (2009) PlanVamaysh Space, 15, pp. 41-63; Schwartz, P., (1996) The Art of the Long View: Paths to Strategic Insight for Yourself and Your Company, , New York: Crown Business; Schoenwald, I., Thoughts on the profession (1990) J Prosthet Orthot, 2, pp. 182-185; Hovorka, C.F., Shurr, D.G., Bozik, D.S., The concept of an entry-level interdisciplinary graduate degree preparing orthotists for the new millennium part 1: History of orthotic and prosthetic education (2002) J Prosthet Orthot, 14, pp. 51-58; (1999) Practitioner Book of Rules, pp. 4-6. , American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, Inc Alexandria, VA: American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, Inc.;; Ford, N., Helmbring, A., Hodge, M.C., Hovorka, C., Prosthetic & Orthotic Educators Meeting Post Meeting Book (2002) Jönköping University, Sweden: Department of Rehabilitation, School of Health Sciences, , Chapter 8: In: NCOPE, editor; (2011) World Report on Disability, , World Health Organization, Geneva: World Health Organization; Ramstrand, N., Brodtkorb, T.H., Considerations for developing an evidenced-based practice in orthotics and prosthetics (2008) Prosthet Orthot Int, 32, pp. 93-102; William, J., Susan, K., Chailes, H., Darrel, C., The changing face of O and P education: Can we make a batter practioner (1993) J Prosthet Orthot, 5, pp. 44-56","Alireza, T.; Department of Medical Education, Isfahan University of Medical SciencesIran; email: taheri@rehab.mui.ac.ir",,,"Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications",,,,,22779531,,,,"English","J.

In this view, each one of their many seemingly hard-wired behavioral routines is triggered by a precisely defined environmental stimulus configuration, but there is no mental appreciation of the possible outcomes of one's actions, and therefore little flexibility. However, many studies show problem-solving behavior in various arthropod species that falls outside the range of fixed behavior routines. We propose that a basic form of foresight, the ability to predict the outcomes of one's own actions, is at the heart of such behavioral flexibility, and that the evolutionary roots of such outcome expectation are found in the need to disentangle sensory input that is predictable from self-generated motion versus input generated by changes in the outside world. Based on this, locusts, grasshoppers, dragonflies and flies seem to use internal models of the surrounding world to tailor their actions adaptively to predict the imminent future. Honeybees and orb-weaving spiders appear to act towards a desired outcome of their respective constructions, and the genetically pre-programmed routines that govern these constructions are subordinate to achieving the desired goal. Jumping spiders seem to preplan their route to prey suggesting they recognize the spatial challenge and actions necessary to obtain prey. Bumblebees and ants utilize objects not encountered in the wild as types of tools to solve problems in a manner that suggests an awareness of the desired outcome. Here we speculate that it may be simpler, in terms of the required evolutionary changes, computation and neural architecture, for arthropods to recognize their goal and predict the outcomes of their actions towards that goal, rather than having a large number of pre-programmed behaviors necessary to account for their observed behavioral flexibility. © 2018 The Authors",,"Acrididae; awareness; bumblebee; dragonfly; expectation; heart; honeybee; human; human experiment; jumping; motion; nonhuman; review; sensory stimulation; spider",,,,,"Gould, J.L., Gould, C.G., The insect mind: physics or metaphysics?

Following completion of the tenth annual scan, we reviewed the 15 topics identified a decade ago and assessed their development in the scientific literature and news media. Five topics, including microplastic pollution, synthetic meat, and environmental applications of mobile-sensing technology, appeared to have had widespread salience and effects. The effects of six topics were moderate, three have not emerged, and the effects of one topic were low. The awareness of, and involvement in, these issues by 12 conservation organisations has increased for most issues since 2009. © 2018","biodiversity; environment; foresight; forward look; futures; prioritisation","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; conservation management; environmental fate; environmental protection; global perspective; prioritization; biodiversity; environmental protection; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources",,,,,"Könnölä, T., Facing the future: scanning, synthesizing and sense-making in horizon scanning (2012) Sci.

Our estimation results for major industrialized economies suggest that central banks have actually had a key influence on the level of long-term interest rates. We thus show that 1) the customary neoclassical model of interest rate determination, on which central banks tend to rely, is neither rooted in the institutional setup of the credit markets nor supported by the data, and that 2) the Austrian explanation incorporated in the model of Wicksell–Mises–Hayek of the credit and business cycle fits better the economic reality. As central bank policy makers might lack the necessary knowledge and foresight to set market rates to levels consistent with economic fundamentals, there is a high chance of misalignments of market rates. The correction of misalignments could lead to severe economic disruptions. © 2019 Scottish Economic Society",,"central bank; economic development; economic policy; interest rate; market conditions; market system; Austria; Japan; United Kingdom; United States",,,,,"Arize, A.C., Malinfretos, J., Ike Obi, Z., Long- and short-term interest rates in 19 countries: test of cointegration and parameter instability (2002) Atlantic Economic Journal, 30 (2), pp. 107-122; Barnes, B., A Co-integrating approach to budget deficits of long-term interest rates (2008) Applied Economics, 40, pp. 127-133; Belke, A., Klose, J., Equilibrium real interest rates and secular stagnation: An empirical analysis for euro area member countries (2017) Journal of Common Market Studies, 55 (6), pp. 1221-1238; Belke, A., Gros, D., Osowski, T., The effectiveness of the Fed's quantitative easing policy: New evidence based on international interest rate differentials (2017) Journal of International Money and Finance, 73, pp. 335-349; Bernanke, B.S., (2005) The global savings glut and the U.S. current account deficit: Remarks by Governor Ben S.

Two specific propositions are outlined and developed. The first is that twenty-first-century financial capitalism is conspicuously vulnerable to implosion or collapse, notably via a Habermasian ‘legitimation crisis’. The second traces its progressive ‘fracturing’, with references to neoliberal austerity and post-welfarism and their deepening impact on the disadvantaged and vulnerable and the sick and disabled. The article then turns to Bhaskar’s dialectical critical realism, suggesting, and attempting to show, that it lends additional philosophical and theoretical weight (‘deepens’ in Bhaskar’s terms) the reach and range of Marxian analyses. The third part of the article focuses on Bhaskar’s evolving theory of transformative – or emancipatory – action. It is contended that his account grounds and allows for rational and compelling resistance to financial capitalism’s neoliberal status quo. In the concluding section, the affinity between Bhaskar’s (neo-Marxian) theory of transformative action and the present authors’ concept of ‘action sociology’ is outlined. The article concludes with a manifesto for an action sociology oriented to ‘absence’, challenging ‘constraining ills’ and imagining and researching ‘alternate futures’. © The Author(s) 2019.","Bhaskar; class/command dynamic; contradiction; critical realism; emancipation; foresight and action sociology; human flourishing; Marx; weaponising stigma",,,,,,"Bhaskar, R., (1987) The Possibility of Naturalism: A Philosophical Critique of the Contemporary Social Sciences, , 2nd edn., Hemel Hempstead, Harvester Press; Bhaskar, R., (2016) Enlightened Common Sense: The Philosophy of Critical Realism, , London, Routledge; Bhaskar, R., (2017) The Order of Natural Necessity, , London, Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (1980) The Logic of Practice, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Buechler, S., (2008) Critical Sociology, , Boulder, CO, Paradigm Publishers; Burawoy, M., For public sociology (2005) American Sociological Review, 70, pp. 4-28; Carroll, W., The corporate elite and the transformation of financial capital: A view from Canada (2008) Remembering Elites, , Savage M., Williams K., (eds), Oxford, Blackwell, In:, (eds; Creaven, S., (2007) Emergentist Marxism: Dialectical Philosophy and Social Theory, , London, Routledge; Davis, A., (2018) Reckless Opportunists: Elites at the End of the Establishment, , Manchester, Manchester University Press; Dorling, D., (2014) All That Is Solid: The Great Housing Disaster, , London, Allen Lane; Giddens, A., (1990) Consequences of Modernity, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Goffman, E., (1968) Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity, , Harmondsworth, Penguin; Habermas, J., (1975) Legitimation Crisis, , London, Heinemann; Habermas, J., (1984) Theory of Communicative Action: Reason and the Rationalization of Society, 1. , London, Heinemann; Habermas, J., (1987) Theory of Communicative Action: Lifeworld and System – A Critique of Functionalist Reason, 2. , Cambridge, Polity Press; Jacquet, J., (2015) Is Shame Necessary?, , London, Allen Lane; Kakutani, M., (2018) The Death of Truth, , London, William Collins; Link, B.G., Phelan, J.C., Conceptualizing stigma (2001) American Review of Sociology, 27, pp. 363-385; Mason, P., (2015) Postcapitalism: A Guide to the Future, , London, Allen Lane; Mills, C.W., (1956) The Power Elite, , New York, Oxford University Press; Monbiot, G., (2017) Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics for an Age of Crisis, , London, Verso Books; Parker, R., Aggleton, P., HIV and AIDS-related stigma and discrimination: A conceptual framework and implications for action (2003) Social Science and Medicine, 57, pp. 13-24; Sayer, D., (2015) Why We Can’t Afford the Rich, , Bristol, Policy Press; Scambler, G., The ‘project of modernity’ and the parameters for a critical sociology: An argument with illustrations from medical sociology (1996) Sociology, 30, pp. 567-581; Scambler, G., Health-related stigma (2009) Sociology of Health and Illness, 31, pp. 441-455; Scambler, G., Heaping blame upon shame: ‘Weaponising stigma’ for neoliberalism (2018) Sociological Review, 66, pp. 766-782. , (, a; Scambler, G., (2018) Sociology, Health and the Fractured Society: A Critical Realist Account, , London, Routledge, (, b; Scambler, G., The labour party, health and the National Health Service Manifestos, Policies and Practices: An Equalities Agenda, , Scott D., (ed), London, UCL Press, (in press), In:, (ed; Scambler, G., Kelleher, D., New social and health movements: Issues of representation and change (2006) Critical Public Health, 16, pp. 219-231; Scambler, G., Scambler, S., Marx, critical realism and health inequalities (2013) Medical Sociology on the Move: New Directions in Theory, , Cockerham W., (ed), New York, Springer, In:, (ed; Scambler, G., Scambler, S., Theorizing health inequalities: The untapped potential of dialectical critical realism (2015) Social Theory and Health, 13, pp. 340-354; Streeck, W., (2016) How Will Capitalism End?, , London, Verso; Urry, J., (2016) What Is the Future?, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Wallerstein, I., Collins, R., Mann, M., (2018) Does Capitalism Have a Future?, , Oxford, Oxford University Press","Scambler, G.; University College London (UCL)United Kingdom; email: g.scambler@surrey.ac.uk",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,1468795X,,,,"English","J.

The principal manipulating factors inciting this change were absence of appropriate vaccination campaigns and increased urbanization & population growth in forest areas, with prevalence of the virus in the species inhabiting of these areas. The 2016/2018 outbreaks exhibited incidence in areas with historically low or no yellow fever virus activity, triggering a surge in recorded deaths - mainly in the Southeastern states of Brazil. The Brazilian government aggressively responded, reforming the countries' prophylactic measures, including vaccine implementation - as of March, 2018, switching from the former double dose regimen of the vaccine, to a single dose protocol, deemed as adequate. Moreover, some states appropriated the fractionated dosage (1/5 of the standard dose), in foresight of potential vaccine shortages. To prevent the uprising of new sylvatic yellow fever cases in Brazil, it's obligatory the development of effective combative plans, including adaptation of prophylactic measures individually (use of repellents, protective clothing etc.), applicable vaccination campaigns in every endemic region, to raise awareness to locals and visitors alike. Notwithstanding these preventative strategies, the persistence of cases and the recent outbreaks in Brazil, highlight the possible ineffectiveness of combative measures. Based on these considerations, the objective of this review was to raise more awareness of the epidemiological impact of the disease in Brazil. © 2019 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Aedes aegypti; Arboviruses; Epidemiology; Infectious disease; Yellow fever","yellow fever vaccine; Aedes aegypti; Article; Brazil; Brazilian; chronology; clinical feature; epidemic; human; infection prevention; nonhuman; population growth; pregnant woman; priority journal; urbanization; vaccination; vaccine production; virus pathogenesis; virus transmission; yellow fever; Yellow fever virus",,,,,"Lilay, A., Asamene, N., Bekele, A., Mengesha, M., Wendabeku, M., Tareke, I., Reemergence of yellow fever in Ethiopia after 50 years, 2013: Epidemiological and entomological investigations (2017) BMC Infect Dis, 17 (1), p. 343; Higuera, A., Ramírez, J.D., Molecular epidemiology of dengue, yellow fever, zika and chikungunya arboviruses: An update (2018) Acta Tropic, 190, pp. 99-111; Monath, T.P., Yellow fever: An update (2001) Lancet Infect Dis, 1 (1), pp. 11-20; Bonaldo, M.C., Gómez, M.M., Santos, A.A.C., Abreu, F.V.S., Brito, A.F., Miranda, R.M., Genome analyses of yellow fever vírus of the ongoing outbreak in Brazil reveals polymorphisms (2017) Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, 112 (6), pp. 447-451; (2018) Disease: Yellow Fever, , http://www.who.int/csr/disease/yellowfev/en/, World Health Organization about 2 screens.

Peanut-allergic individuals can be both cosensitized and coallergic to such items, requiring foresight when eliciting a clinical history of a reaction, in the diagnostic evaluation of such allergies, and in the counseling of patients as to food avoidances after a diagnosis is made. Legume allergens belong to the Fabaceae family and encompass the cupin, prolamin, PR-10, and lipid transfer protein families, which mediate cross-sensitization including that between peanut and tree nut. Among legumes, the most common patterns of clinical cross-reactivity are between peanut and lupine, peanut and soy, as well as chickpea and lentil, though this is highly dependent on geography and prevalence of these foods in the diet. Issues of cross-sensitization may exist between peanut and certain tree nuts, as well as among tree nuts though such patterns do not always result in clinically relevant allergy. Molecular diagnostic testing may be a future tool to help parse out the aforementioned patterns, but oral food challenges are still the gold standard for accurate diagnosis. Although potential desensitization treatments have emerged for peanut allergy, these have not been developed for other legumes and most tree nuts, and desensitization to peanut has not proven to have an effect on legume cross-sensitization. © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Anaphylaxis;

This study aims to conceptualize resilient safety culture in the construction environment by integrating resilience engineering principles into the concept of safety culture. To fulfill this research aim, a correlational research design was used. Data were collected using questionnaire surveys targeting construction project managers involved in the delivery of 78 recently completed building projects in Vietnam. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique with partial least-squares estimation (PLS) was used to analyze the data. The results confirmed 3 dimensions (i.e., psychological resilience, behavioral resilience, and contextual resilience) with 24 measurable scale items to assess safety culture with respect to resilience. The study also revealed that psychological resilience has a weaker impact on accident prevention under higher contextual resilience and behavioral resilience levels. Theoretically, this study provides the theoretical development and empirical evidence to clarify the concept of resilient safety culture in terms of definition, purpose, and value in the context of construction projects. In practical terms, the study suggests that project hazards, unexpected events, and the risk tolerance of construction workers should be addressed to achieve consistently high safety performance. It also offers construction organizations a framework of safety practices to assess their capabilities in managing on-site safety risks. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction; Project complexity; Resilience; Safety; Safety culture","Accident prevention; Behavioral research; Construction; Least squares approximations; Project management; Risk assessment; Surveys; Complex sociotechnical systems; Construction organizations; Construction project managers; Partial least square (PLS); Project complexity; Resilience; Safety culture; Structural equation modeling techniques; Safety engineering",,,,,"(1993) Third Report: Organizing for Safety, , ACSNI (Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations).

O157:H7 is a shiga-like toxin (stx) producing E. coli that cause's major health threats in humans, through oral route. However, the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in vegetables is not yet reported in India. Hence, we surveyed the vegetables markets and enumerated the presence of E. coli O157 in freshly consumed vegetables namely, cucumber, radish, lettuce, cabbage, and menthos. Three consecutive surveys from three different market areas were done with 1 month interval. A total of 603 E. coli colonies were isolated. Presence of shiga toxin genes (Stx) were confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Stx1 and Stx2 markers that showed 25 and 12 positive colonies, respectively. Among the five vegetables, cabbage had the highest Stx positive colonies (16%). Compared to supermarkets, vegetables from the farmers market did not have much load of E. coli O157. Further, characterization of isolated E. coli colonies were performed using PCR techniques with gene specific markers namely, E. coli uidA, E. coli O157 specific uidA and intimin gene markers. Our analysis showed 6% of E. coli O157 population in the freshly consumed vegetables much above than 2% threshold level, thus providing a warning foresight related to disease outbreak. Practical applications: Molecular survey using a number of Escherichia coli O157 specific genes through PCR is an easy, rapid, and a reliable method for pathogenic bacteria identification and characterization amidst other indigenous microbial load. Additionally, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based enumeration of E. coli O157 in vegetables assist us in determining the threshold level for forewarning of pathogenic disease outbreaks. Further, the severity of outbreak could be predicted using E. coli O157 specific shiga toxin (stx) and receptor genes (intimin). The presence of E. coli O157 specific shiga toxins and intimins in a pathogen signifies severity and virulence of strains in causing potential outbreaks. PCR-based studies enables rapid identification of inoculums source (E. coli O157 spread) from farmers field/cattle shed. Thus, it could be reliably used to stop the further spread of disease from the source inoculums during the outbreaks. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Ackers, M.L., Barbara, E.M., Ellen, L., Brant, G., Todd, D., Peggy, S.H., An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157: H7 infections associated with leaf lettuce consumption (1998) Journal of Infectious Diseases, 177, pp. 1588-1593;

In addition, it is a highly unregulated market, with very little standardized information in economic terms. This paper focuses on art galleries, which are the most influential intermediaries in the Spanish primary contemporary fine-art market and perform a role that goes beyond the mere distribution of works of art. This study develops and applies a prospective methodology based on the subjective information compiled by experts, known as the Delphi method, to identify and evaluate the factors that determine the current situation and future outlook for Spanish contemporary art galleries. The results show, on one hand, that the method employed constitutes a valid option to provide reliable information. In addition, they show that the survival of these organizations will depend on their ability to adapt to the changing conditions of the economic environment, reactivating and internationalizing demand, and redirecting their business model towards sustainable management by implementing appropriate business management models and techniques. © 2018 by the authors.","Art galleries; Contemporary art market; Delphi method; Foresight study; Sustainable management","art; business; Delphi analysis; expert system; methodology; model; sustainability; Spain",,,,,"Kurz, K., The Power Balance in the Contemporary Art Market: Artists, Dealers and Collectors (2016) Looking Forward, Looking Back: Drawing on the Past to Shape the Future of Marketing.

ECRA is a bottom-up initiative and helps to facilitate the development of climate change research, combining the capacities of national research institutions, and inducing closer ties between existing national research initiatives, projects and infrastructures. ECRA works as an open platform to bring together climate researchers, providing excellent scientific expertise for policy makers and of societal relevance. The ECRA Board consists of representatives of ECRA partners and decides on governance, scientific priorities, and organisational matters. Currently organized into four Collaborative Programmes, climate scientists share their knowledge, experience and expertise to identify the most important research requirements for the future, thus developing a foresight approach. The CPs cover the topics: (1) Arctic variability and change, (2) Sea level changes and coastal impacts, (3) Changes in the hydrological cycle and (4) High impact events. The CP activities are planned in workshops and participation is open to all interested scientists from the relevant research fields. In particular, young researchers are actively encouraged to join the network. Each CP develops its joint research priorities for shaping European research into the future. Because scientific themes are interconnected, the four Collaborative Programmes interact with each other, e.g.Through the organization of common workshops or joint applications. In addition, the Collaborative Programme leads attend the Board meetings. The different formats of ECRA meetings range from scientific workshops to briefing events and side events at conferences to involve different groups of interests. This facilitates the interaction of scientists, various stakeholder groups and politicians. A biennial open ECRA General Assembly that is organised in Brussels represents an umbrella event and acts as a platform for discussion and contact with stakeholders. This event is an excellent opportunity to jointly discuss research priorities of high societal relevance. 2019 © Author(s).",,"academic research; bottom-up approach; climate change; climate modeling; conference proceeding; future prospect; institutional framework; policy making; research work; stakeholder; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium]; Brussels [Brussels (RGA)]",,,,,"Adler, C., Palazzi, E., Kulonen, A., Balsiger, J., Colangeli, G., Cripe, D., Forsythe, N., Zebisch, M., Monitoring mountains in a changing world: New horizons for the global network for observations and information on mountain environments (GEO-GNOME) (2018) Mt.

It does so by assessing the capacity available to prepare for, initiate and steer a path-deviant sustainability transformation of the urban energy systems in three cities in South Korea–a country facing major challenges in this regard due to a heavy dependence on imported fossil energy resources and centralized institutions. The findings illustrate how synergies between local leadership, empowered communities of practice and trusted intermediation stand out as key drivers for learning transformative governance, in particular if linked to open experimentation, while also shaping the role of international exchange in this. In turn, national policy tends to constrain transformative capacity development and favor incremental modifications. Across all cities studied, major gaps still remain in terms of developing social learning processes that involve systems thinking, sustainability foresight, as well as suitable approaches for embedding more radical innovations. In conclusion, transformative capacity provides a useful lens to understand the potentials and limits of emerging urban governance innovations for unlearning dominant paradigms, and for triggering systemic change that enables more sustainable urban futures. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change mitigation; energy system transformative capacity; social learning; Urban governance",,,,,,"Argyris, C., (1999) On organizational learning, , 2nd ed., Oxford, Malden, Mass: Blackwell Business; Bellinson, R., Chu, E., Learning pathways and the governance of innovations in urban climate change resilience and adaptation (2018) Journal of Environmental Policy & Planning, pp. 1-14; Bennett, C.J., Howlett, M., The lessons of learning: Reconciling theories of policy learning and policy change (1992) Policy Sciences, 25 (3), pp. 275-294; Blaikie, N.W.H., (2009) Designing Social Research: The Logic of Anticipation, , (2nd ed.).

Since this endeavor is a complex task, it is necessary to find an efficient solution to do so. Based on foresight workshops with ‘Radar Groups’ – similar to focus groups – Delphi studies, and netnographies of online communities, we develop a pragmatic foresight process. Since we integrate online communities as information sources in our foresight process, we call this ‘open foresight’. This open foresight process focuses upon the topic ‘Aviation 2040’ and is executed with aviation experts and an online community in two steps. This research setting enabled us to show (1) differences and similarities in future assessments and foresight capabilities between experts and online communities and (2) how to efficiently integrate online communities into foresight processes. Combining insights from experts and community members and, in doing so, moving towards ‘Open Radar Groups’ seems to be a beneficial way for conducting foresight and enriching companies’ knowledge base. © 2018 The Authors","Aviation; Delphi study; Focus group; Netnography; Online community; Open foresight","Aviation; Knowledge based systems; Radar; Social networking (online); DELPHI study; Focus groups; Netnography; On-line communities; Open foresight; Online systems; assessment method; Delphi analysis; ethnography; Internet; monitoring; research method",,,,,"Armstrong, J.S., Long Range Forecasting: From Crystal Ball to Computer (1985), second ed.

The objective of this study was to clarify whether this group also exhibits increased difficulties using episodic foresight to appropriately guide future-directed behaviors. Method: Stroke patients (n = 26) and demographically matched healthy controls (n = 26) were administered a behavioral measure that met strict criteria for assessing episodic foresight. In keeping with our focus on the functional application of foresight, this measure required participants to identify a problem, self-generate a resolution, and execute the appropriate future-directed intention. Results: Relative to controls, individuals who had suffered a stroke were less likely to acquire items that would later allow a problem to be solved and were also less likely to subsequently use these items to solve the problems. There were no group or task differences between left- and right-hemisphere-stroke subgroups. There were also no significant associations between our measure of episodic foresight with other cognitive measures or a measure of daily function. Conclusions: These data indicate that the capacity to apply episodic foresight in an adaptive way can be disrupted after stroke. Future work is now needed to more fully delineate the implications of difficulties engaging episodic foresight in everyday life as well as how these difficulties might be remediated.

We explored how they organize and manage their foresight processes by conducting 30 interviews among five different infrastructure providers, showing that to a large extent they carry out these processes themselves in different locations within the organization and only call on external support for specific subjects. They are not too worried about the importance of the short term but instead want to know how they can connect long-term developments to the short term, and try to deal with different time horizons within their organization. They use the foresight studies of other organizations and their search for information is not overly structured. Infrastructure providers have a well-developed sense of their environment, and they realize that their strategic room offers limited freedom and, in terms of foresight, should work together more than they are doing at the moment. Comparing our findings with two theories, we see that their approach to foresight is often adapted to their approach to innovation, that their foresight is organized in a facilitating, stimulating and framing manner, and that it is centralized as well as decentralized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Foresight processes; Infrastructure; Strategy; The Netherlands; Time horizon","comparative study; future prospect; infrastructural development; infrastructure planning; strategic approach; technological development; Netherlands",,,,,"Adegbile, A., Sarpong, D., Meissner, D., Strategic foresight for innovation management: A review and research agenda (2017) International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management, 14 (4). , 1750019-1 – 1750019-34; Battistella, C., The organization of Corporate Foresight: A multiple case study in the telecommunication industry (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-79; Bolton, R., Foxon, T.J., Infrastructure transformation as a socio-technological process.

However, little is known about the conditions supporting them to open up successfully in open foresight. This research takes a culture perspective on this issue. The leading assumption is that companies with an open culture are more likely to engage in collaboration than companies with a culture inhibiting openness. We use the Competing Values Framework to measure corporate culture, and collaboration breadth and depth to measure openness to external collaboration. Drawing on a sample of 168 Austrian companies, the research confirms that culture plays an important role in creating an environment supportive of open foresight, albeit in a somewhat surprising way: the internally oriented clan culture appears to support openness, while the externally oriented market culture does not support it. Possible explanations for this finding are put forward as directions for further research. The findings should help companies to predict whether they have the cultural conditions in place to embark on an open foresight journey successfully. © 2019 The Authors R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,,,"Appleyard, M.M., Chesbrough, H.W., The dynamics of open strategy.

Perfect foresight is justified by our analysis as a reasonable approximation in some cases, but in the case of a commitment to maintain a low nominal interest rate for a long time, our reflective equilibrium implies neither neo-Fisherian conclusions nor implausibly strong predicted effects of forward guidance. © 2018 American Economic Association.

For this purpose, a comparative analysis of technology monitoring results using various data collections (scientific publications, patents, media, foresight projects, conferences, international projects, dissertations and presentations) is conducted. Guidance on how to use them to ensure the greatest output is presented. Green energy is taken as an example for comparative analysis and provides improvements in reducing inputs (time) and increasing output (coverage). The factors that affect data processing results are considered and discussed to more efficiently use quantitative and qualitative procedures for identifying, correcting and updating technology trends. The results of the study can be interesting for government bodies financing foresight studies and setting priorities in science and technology, for companies scanning disruptive innovations in the markets to support their corporate strategies and academic community developing the methodology for technology trends monitoring. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","data sources; green energy; Technology foresight; technology trends monitoring",,,,,,"Chen, C., CiteSpace II: Detecting and Visualising Emerging Trends and Transient Patterns in Scientific Literature (2006) Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology, 57 (3), pp. 359-377; Chen, H., Chiang, R.H.L., Storey, V.C., Business Intelligence and Analytics: From Big Data to Big Impact (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1165-1188; Cobo, M.J., Lopez-Herrera, A.G., Herrera-Viedma, E., Herrera, F., An Approach for Detecting, Quantifying, and Visualising the Evolution of a Research Field: A Practical Application to the Fuzzy Sets Theory Field (2011) Journal for Informetrics, 5 (1), pp. 146-166; Corrocher, N., Malerba, F., Montobbio, F., (2003), The Emergence of New Technologies the ICT Field: Main Actors, Geographical Distribution and Knowledge Sources TENIA project; Cozzens, S., Gatchair, S., Kang, J., Kim, K.-S., Lee, H.J., Ordóñez, G., Porter, A., Emerging Technologies: Quantitative Identification and Measurement (2010) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 22 (3), pp. 361-376; Daim, T.U., Rueda, G., Martin, H., Gerdsri, P., Forecasting Emerging Technologies: Use of Bibliometrics and Patent Analysis (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73 (8), pp. 981-1012; Dereli, T., Durmusoglu, A., A Trend-Based Patent Alert System for Technology Watch (2009) Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research, 68, pp. 674-679; Ena, O., Mikova, N., Saritas, O., Sokolova, A., A Methodology for Technology Trend Monitoring: The Case of Semantic Technologies (2016) Scientometrics, 108, pp. 1013-1041; Farber, M., Using a Semantic Wiki for Technology Forecast and Technology Monitoring (2016) Program, 50 (2), pp. 225-242; Fattori, M., Pedrazzi, G., Turra, R., Text Mining Applied to Patent Mapping: A Practical Business Case (2003) World Patent Information, 25, pp. 335-342; Guo, H., Weingart, S., Borner, K., Mixed-Indicators Model for Identifying Emerging Research Areas (2011) Scientometrics, 89 (1), pp. 421-435; Jordan, M.I., Mitchel, T.M., Machine Learning: Trends, Perspectives and Prospects (2015) Science, 349 (6245), pp. 255-260; Kajikawa, Y., Yoshikawa, J., Takeda, Y., Matsushima, K., Tracking Emerging Technologies in Energy Research: Toward a Roadmap for Sustainable Energy (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (6), pp. 771-782; Kim, Y.G., Suh, J.H., Park, S.C., Visualisation of Patent Analysis for Emerging Technology (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (3), pp. 1804-1812; Kostoff, R.N., Briggs, M.B., Solka, J.L., Rushenberg, R.L., Literature-Related Discovery (LRD): Methodology (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (2), pp. 186-202; Krzywicki, A., Wobcke, W., Bain, M., Martinez, J.C., Compton, P., Data Mining for Building Knowledge Bases: Techniques, Architectures and Applications (2016) The Knowledge Engineering Review, 31 (2), pp. 97-123; Lee, H., Lee, S., Yoon, B., Technology Clustering Based on Evolutionary Patterns: The Case of Information and Communications Technologies (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (6), pp. 953-967; Lee, S., Yoon, B., Park, Y., An Approach to Discovering New Technology Opportunities: Keyword-Based Patent Map Approach (2009) Technovation, 29 (6-7), pp. 481-497; Martino, J., A Review of Selected Recent Advances in Technological Forecasting (2003) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 70 (8), pp. 719-733; Mikova, N., Sokolova, A., Global Technology Trends Monitoring: Theoretical Frameworks and Best Practices (2014) Foresight-Russia, 8 (4), pp. 64-83; Morris, S., DeYong, C., Wu, Z., Salman, S., Yemenu, D., DIVA: A Visualisation System for Exploring Document Databases for Technology Forecasting (2002) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 43 (4), pp. 841-862; O’Reilly, T., (2005), https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/4580/1/MPRA_paper_4580.pdf, What Is Web 2.0?

Data from official statistics based on international classifications, although very useful, is not sufficient to keep pace with sudden changes affecting local territories as well as external factors that may influence a given territorial policy. Furthermore, the use of new data sources, far from being a simple solution to the need of fresh and granular data, implies tackling numerous methodological challenges. The paper presents the rationality of an information system able to support policy-makers in technological foresight. The model is based on the valorisation of data available from traditional and non-traditional sources as well as the construction of simple and intuitive interpretative tools to measure and predict territorial changes and transformations, which are related to the innovation system of Italian regions. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Data-informed Policy Making; Foresight Tool; Innovation Policy; New Data Sources","Data-sources; External factors; Growth potential; Innovation policies; Innovation system; Official Statistics; Policy making; Regional policies; Decision making",,,,,"Aghion, P., David, P.A., Foray, D., Science, technology and innovation for economic growth: Linking policy research and practice (2009) Research Policy, 38 (4), pp. 681-693; Barca, F., McCann, P., Rodriguez-Pose, A., The case for regional development intervention: Place-based versus place-neutral approaches (2012) Journal of Regional Science, 52 (1), pp. 134-152; Boschma, R., Frenken, K., Technological relatedness and regional branching (2011) Beyond Territory: Dynamic Geographies of Knowledge Creation, Diffusion and Innovation, , H.

The aim is to identify, examine, and place in a hierarchical structure, based on a two-step exploratory methodology, the motivators for IT adoption of four main categories of healthcare stakeholders (employees, patients, UAE citizens and residents, and accredited foresight experts) via an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model. AHP revealed the relative importance weights of the seven IT adoption motivators and their 41 sub-motivators. Government support was found to be the most important group of motivators, followed by knowledge sharing, infrastructure, green management, lean management, internal/external environment, and social sustainability. The paper facilitates improving technology adoption generally, specifically in the UAE’s healthcare system. A Pareto chart visually presents the ranking of all sub-factors to help supply-chain practitioners better allocate resources for IT implementation. Little research has examined the combined perspectives of various stakeholders and no study has hitherto investigated the significant motivators of IT adoption in the UAEs’ healthcare industry.

Technology foresight methods therefore play a central role in innovation management for a wide range of industries, including the chemical industry. The extremely broad spectrum of methods is constantly being further developed. Usually, combinations of several methods are used, each with very specific approaches to solving a problem. Within the scope of this paper different methods have been examined exemplarily in the field of energy research. Publication analyses provide indications of existing and emerging trends. Creative methods, on the other hand, can be used for scenario development, since possible disruptive events can also be taken into account. Scenario development requires not only an examination of technological aspects, but also taking into account possible sociological and economic developments. The socio-economic context is critical for the implementation of a technology. , Wiley-VCH Verlag.

We conducted systematic reviews of empirical studies comparing traditional and alternative approaches to instruction or assessment to examine the potential for compulsory schooling to be redesigned. This thorough scan of the scholarly horizon provides an opportunity to take the pulse from the literature published over the first one-eighth of the 21st century. Sixteen “weak signals” were identified from the literature that are discussed in the paper. This review might inform further research into current and future school designs and models, particularly in light of trends to personalise learning that are taking hold around the world. © 2019 The Authors","21st Century learning; Compulsory schooling; Foresight; Formative assessment; Future focused learning; Standardised assessment; Student-centred instruction; Systematic review; Teacher-centred instruction",,,,,,"Abbott, J., Overschooled but undereducated: How the crisis in education is jeopardizing our adolescents (2010), A&C Black; Adie, L., Learning as identity and practice through involvement in online moderation (2012) Educational Assessment, Evaluation and Accountability, 24 (1), pp. 43-56; Ahn, S., Ames, A.J., Myers, N.D., A review of meta-analyses in education: Methodological strengths and weaknesses (2012) Review of Educational Research, 82 (4), pp. 436-476; Ajiboye, J.O., Ajitoni, S., Effects of full and quasi-participatory learning strategies on Nigerian senior secondary students’ environmental knowledge: Implications for classroom practice (2008) International Journal of Environmental and Science Education, 3 (2), pp. 58-66; Al-Amoush, S., Usak, M., Erdogan, M., Markic, S., Eilks, I., Pre-service and in-service teachers’ beliefs about teaching and learning chemistry in Turkey (2013) European Journal of Teacher Education, 36 (4), pp. 464-479; Ampadu, E., Investigation into the teaching and learning of mathematics in junior secondary schools: The case of Ghana (2012), Anglia Ruskin University; Anderson, K.J., Science education and test-based accountability: Reviewing their relationship and exploring implications for future policy (2012) Science Education, 96 (1), pp. 104-129; Anderson, R., Chang, B., Mathematics course-taking in rural high schools (2011) Journal of Research in Rural Education, 26, pp. 1-10; Angrist, J., Pischke, J., Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricists’ companion (2009); Arthur, J., Waring, M., Coe, R., Hedges, L.V., Research methods and methodologies in education (2012), SAGE; Auerbach, S., Collier, S., Bringing high stakes from the classroom to the parent center: Lessons from an intervention program for immigrant families (2012) Teachers College Record, 114 (3), p. n3; Aydogdu, B., Selanik-Ay, T., Determination of teacher characteristics that support constructivist learning environments (2016) Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 63, pp. 293-310; Barlow, T., The end of’ chalk and talk’ (2012) Teaching Science, 58 (1), pp. 56-59; Bayirtepe, E., Tuzun, H., The effects of game-based learning environments on students’ achievement and self-efficacy in a computer course (2007) Hacettepe Universitesi Egitim Fakultesi Dergisi- Hacettepe University Journal of Education, 33, pp. 41-54; Beausaert, S.A., Segers, M., Wiltink, D.P., The influence of teachers’ teaching approaches on students’ learning approaches: The student perspective (2013) Educational Research, 55 (1), pp. 1-15; Black, P., Wiliam, D., The formative purpose: Assessment must first promote learning (2004) Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education, 103 (2), pp. 20-50; Blank, L.M., Hewson, P.W., A metacognitive learning cycle: A better warranty for student understanding?

Several bibliometric visualizations of the cumulated 50 years of futures studies scholarship are created to show 1) thematic clusters of research, 2) research intensity, 3) recent research trends, 4) research trajectory by cluster over time, 5) relative clusters’ representation within and across journals and 6) research locations. The 6 research clusters identified by the clustering algorithm are renamed corporate foresight; past & futures; humanity at the limen; environmental futures; post-normality & complexity, and technological trends, according to their underlying themes, and discussed in depth one by one. Several objective observations on the maps’ structure uncover the main research gaps in the literature. Based on these observations, the article provides 6 recommendations on how to fill these research gaps to improve the discipline's fragmentation. Based on the visualizations, it can also be observed that the majority of futures studies publications belong to two clusters: past & futures and corporate foresight, and that the sudden increase in the total number of futures studies articles citations after 2004 is attributable to the corresponding increase in the relative percentage of research activity in one cluster: corporate foresight. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bibliometric; Futures studies; Research gaps; Research trends; Review; Science map","algorithm; cluster analysis; literature review; mapping; research work; trend analysis; visualization",,,,,"Agoramoorthy, G., Can India meet the increasing food demand by 2020?

Some people think of the future as their own achievements and opportunities, while others make plans to develop their business and ensure its viability. But both are United by one thing – they need food every day: in the present time and in the future. This article describes the forecast until 2030 for the development of the food industry. The main parameters of the food industry of the future period are predicted: what will be the sources of raw materials, methods of processing of packaging and storage. New solutions of outdated problems of food production are discussed: resource deficit, genetically modified food sources, food waste, non-decomposing packaging and other challenges of the present time. The method of foresight is used, when experts in this field of the economy Express their assumptions about which of the emerging trends in the development of the food industry will be fixed, how they are modified, what its traditional parameters will remain in the past. On the basis of the conducted research it is concluded that the food industry development, the emergence of new resource sources of food protein and food energy, a significant change in the technological apparatus of the food industry of the world economy, a decisive turn to the solution of the problem of food waste and recycling of food packaging.

I propose that non-adherence to long-term therapies is at least in part due to failure to prioritize the future, which is caused by a condition I dub disruption in time projection. This article gives the rationale for this hypothesis, which is largely grounded on philosophical arguments. Then, it demonstrates the plausibility of the hypothesis: on the one hand, it is consistent with certain epidemiological data found in the literature. On the other, it is possible to predict the underlying mechanisms of this lack of prioritization from recent achievements of neuro-economics and neuroscience. Next, it reviews empirical data that provide an experimental verification for this explanatory hypothesis. Finally, a general evolutionary and philosophical meaning for adherence is proposed, considering the advantages of its preconditions, namely, patience and foresight. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Adherence; Chronic diseases; Disruption in time projection; Habit; Obedience; Patience; Philosophy; Principle of foresight; Temporal horizon; Trust",,,,,,"Assan, R., Hautecouverture, G., Guillemand, S., Dauchy, F., Protin, P., Dérot, M., Évolution de paramètres hormonaux (glucagon, cortisol, hormone somatotrope) et énergétiques (glucose, acides gras libres, glycérol) dans dix acidocétoses diabétiques graves traitées (1969) Pathol Biol, 17, pp. 1095-1098; Tchobroutsky, G., How to achieve better diabetic control?

Current methods dealing with those risks are confronted with the problems of being primarily based on past data and experience, neglecting the need for objectivity, focusing on the short-term future and disregarding the interconnectedness of different financial risk categories. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review of risk governance, financial risk management and open foresight was executed to conceptualize solutions to the mentioned-above problems. Findings: Collaborative financial risk assessment (CFRA) is a promising approach in financial risk governance with respect to overcoming said problems. It is a method of risk identification and assessment, which combines aspects of “open foresight” and the financial risk management and governance literature. CFRA is characterized as bringing together members of different companies in trying to detect weak signals and trends to gain knowledge about the future, which helps companies to reduce financial risks and increase the chance of gaining economic value. By overcoming organizational boundaries, individual companies may gain the knowledge they would probably not have without CFRA and achieve a competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications: A conceptual paper like the one at hand wants empirical proof. Therefore, the authors developed a research agenda in the form of five propositions for further research.

Conavi's Foresight ICE is a new ICE system that uses a mechanically rotating transducer to generate a 2D conical surface image in 3D space, in contrast to the more typical side-firing phased array. When combined with magnetic tracking technology, this unique imaging geometry poses new calibration challenges and opportunities. Existing ultrasound calibration methods are designed for 2D planar images and cannot be trivially applied to unique 2:5D conical surface images provided by the Foresight ICE system. In this work a spatial and temporal calibration technique applied to the unique case of conical ultrasound image data is described and validated. Precision of calibration parameters is used to quantify the validation of our calibration method and the overall system accuracy is validated using point source and sphere centroid localization. We re-port a maximum error of 5:07mm for point reconstruction accuracy and 1:94mm for sphere centroid localization accuracy. © 2019 SPIE.","Conavi; Intracardiac echocardiography; Radial ultrasound; Ultrasound calibration","Calibration; Echocardiography; Ice; Robotics; Ultrasonic applications; Calibration parameters; Cardiac interventions; Conavi; Intracardiac echocardiographies; Localization accuracy; Point reconstruction; Temporal calibration; Ultrasound calibration; Medical imaging",,,,,"Jongbloed, M.R.M., Schalij, M.J., Zeppenfeld, K., Oemrawsingh, P.V., Van Der Wall, E.E., Bax, J.J., Clinical applications of intracardiac echocardiography in interventional procedures (2005) Heart (British Cardiac Society), 91, pp. 981-990. , jul; Courtney, B., Witcomb, N., (2017) Data Display and Processing Algorithms for 3D Imaging Systems; Mercier, L., Langø, T., Lindseth, F., Collins, D.L., A review of calibration techniques for freehand 3-d ultrasound systems (2005) Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology, 31, pp. 449-471. , apr; Linte, C.A., Rettmann, M.E., Dilger, B., Gunawan, M.S., Arunachalam, S.P., Holmes, D.R., Packer, D.L., Robb, R.A., Calibration and evaluation of a magnetically tracked ice probe for guidance of left atrial ablation therapy (2012) Proceedings of SPIE-the International Society for Optical Engineering, 8316, p. 83162P. , feb; Medical Aurora-Medical, , https://www.ndigital.com/medical/products/aurora/; Lasso, A., Heffter, T., Rankin, A., Pinter, C., Ungi, T., Fichtinger, G., PLUS: Open-source toolkit for ultrasound-guided intervention systems (2014) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 61, pp. 2527-2537. , oct; Fedorov, A., Beichel, R., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Finet, J., Fillion-Robin, J.-C., Pujol, S., Bauer, C., Kikinis, R., 3D slicer as an image computing platform for the quantitative imaging network (2012) Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 30, pp. 1323-1341. , nov; Chen, E.C.S., Peters, T.M., Ma, B., Which point-line registration?

In this task, children eat pretzels (inducing thirst) and then are asked to reason about future preferences (pretzels or water). Children typically perform poorly on this task, indicating a future preference for water over pretzels, potentially due to conflicting current and future states. Given past work showing that children's future reasoning is more accurate for another person, we asked 90 thirsty 3- to 7-year-olds to reason about their own and an experimenter's future preference. Results showed that thirsty children had more difficulty predicting their own future preference compared with the experimenter's. Thirstier children were more likely to predict a future preference for water. Thirst interacted with age when making a future choice for the experimenter. How psychological distance might boost episodic foresight and possible reasons for children's poor pretzel task performance are discussed. Highlights: Does psychological distancing improve children's ability to make accurate future predictions when current and future states conflict? Using the Pretzel task, thirsty children were less accurate when predicting their own future preferences compared with the future preferences of another person. Psychological distancing may help children overcome their current state to reason more accurately about the future. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","episodic foresight; future reasoning; physiological state; psychological distance; self-other differences; young children",,,,,,"Atance, C.M., Jackson, L.K., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102, pp. 379-391. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2009.01.001; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2005.05.001; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., Preschoolers' current desires warp their choices for the future (2006) Psychological Science, 17, pp. 583-587. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01748.x; Bauckham, G., Lambert, R., Atance, C., Davidson, P.S., Taler, V., Renoult, L., Predicting our own and others' future preferences: The role of social distance (2018) Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology, 72, pp. 634-642. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1747021818763573; Bélanger, M.J., Atance, C.M., Varghese, A.L., Nguyen, V., Vendetti, C., What will I like best when I'm all grown up?

At any node of a decision tree, the decision maker looks forward a fixed number of stages perfectly. Beyond that, the decision maker aggregates continuation values according to a function that captures reasoning under unpredictability. The model is uniquely identified from the decision maker's preference over decision trees. Confronting a decision tree, the decision maker iteratively revises her plan for the future as she moves forward in the decision tree. A comparative measure of unpredictability aversion and several examples are discussed.

Much research has gone into the improved efficiency of building operation and construction products. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is commonly used to assess existing buildings or building products. Classic LCA, however, is not suited for evaluating the environmental performance of developing technologies. A new approach, anticipatory LCA (a-LCA), promises various advantages and can be used as a design constraint during the product development stage. It helps overcome four challenges: (i) data availability, (ii) stakeholder inclusion, (iii) risk assessment, and (iv) multi-criteria problems. This article's contribution to the line of research is twofold: first, it adapts the a-LCA approach for construction-specific purposes in theoretical terms for the four challenges. Second, it applies the method to an innovative prefabricated modular envelope system, the CleanTechBlock (CTB), focusing on challenge (i). Thirty-six CTB designs are tested and compared to conventional walls. Inclusion of technology foresight is achieved through structured scenario analysis. Moreover, challenge (iv) is tackled through the analysis of different environmental impact categories, transport-related impacts, and thickness of the wall assemblies of the CTB. The case study results show that optimized material choice and product design is needed to reach the lowest environmental impact. Methodological findings highlight the importance of context-specific solutions and the need for benchmarking new products. © 2019 by Yale University","anticipatory life cycle assessment (a-LCA); ecodesign; environmental assessment; external wall; foresight; industrial ecology","Ecodesign; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Product design; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Walls (structural partitions); Environmental assessment; External walls; foresight; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle",,,,,"(2015) Implementing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) 2016, 4. , http://www.buildup.eu/en/practices/publications/2016-implementing-epbd-featuring-country-reports-0, Lisboa, Portugal, Author, Retrieved from; Agarwal, R., Sridhar, M., Chandrasekaran, S., (2016) Imagining construction's digital future, , New York, NY, McKinsey & Company; Anand, C.K., Amor, B., Recent developments, future challenges and new research directions in LCA of buildings: A critical review (2017) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 67, pp. 408-416; Arvidsson, R., Molander, S., Prospective life cycle assessment of epitaxial graphene production at different manufacturing scales and maturity (2016) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 21 (5), pp. 1153-1164; Asif, M., Muneer, T., Kelley, R., Life cycle assessment: A case study of a dwelling home in Scotland (2007) Building and Environment, 42 (3), pp. 1391-1394; Becker, R., Fundamentals of performance-based building design (2008) Building Simulation, 1 (4), pp. 356-371; Berger, T., Amann, C., Formayer, H., Korjenic, A., Pospischal, B., Neururer, C., Smutny, R., Impacts of climate change upon cooling and heating energy demand of office buildings in Vienna, Austria (2014) Energy and Buildings, 80, pp. 517-530; Cabeza, L.F., Rincón, L., Vilariño, V., Pérez, G., Castell, A., Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and life Cycle Energy Analysis (LCEA) of buildings and the building sector: A review (2014) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 29, pp. 394-416; Caduff, M., Huijbregts, M.A.J., Althaus, H.-J., Koehler, A., Hellweg, S., Wind power electricity: The bigger the turbine (2012) The Greener the Electricity?

To illustrate the future direction of an educational system, it is necessary to have a trend analysis of what weaknesses and strengths have existed in the past and the present. Materials and Methods: In this analysis, two methods of scoping review and interview were conducted. For the purpose of scoping review, database searches of PubMed, ERIC, SID, and Web of Science in combination with a search on websites of key organizations, including universities, World Health Organization, and International Society of O and P were conducted. Results: Various trends have been formed from different aspects in the health education system due to multifaceted nature of the O and P. The areas include health and education services, technology, curriculum, educational programs, and accreditation. Conclusion: The debate on monitoring and evaluation of O and P educational systems has been also developed along with the progress made in the training of O and P. The training of individuals by setting minimum standards leads to a professional competency in line and is considered as other issues arisen in the field of education; however, in recent years, improvements in this field have not been significant. © 2019 Journal of Research in Medical Sciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Education; foresight; orthotics and prosthetics; trend","accreditation; adult; article; curriculum; female; health education; human; human experiment; interview; Iran; male; Medline; monitoring; orthotics; systematic review; Web of Science; World Health Organization",,,,,"Patrick, B., (2002) Corporate Foresight in Europe: A First Overview, p. 10. , Working Paper European Commission;; Martin, H.M., (2017) Oxford Dictionary, p. 105. , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/process, [Last accessed on 2017 Jun 12]; Webster, J., Murphy, D., (2018) Atlas of Orthoses and Assistive Devices E-Book, , Philadelphia, America: Elsevier Health Sciences;; Kogler, G.F., Materials and technology (2000) Orthotics and Prosthetics in Rehabilitation, pp. 11-32. , In: Lusardi MM, Nielsen CC, editors, Boston: Butterworth Heinemann; Farrell, M.P., Schmitt, M.H., Heinemann, G.D., Informal roles and the stages of interdisciplinary team development (2001) J Interprof Care, 15, pp. 281-295; (2011), http://www.health.behdasht.gov.ir/aging/office, Interview Head of the Office the Elderly of Health of Health Ministry.

We establish theoretically that reductions in mortgage rates always have a positive effect on prices, whereas the relaxation of loan-to-value constraints has ambiguous effects. A quantitative version of the model under perfect foresight accounts for about one-half of the observed price increase in the United States in the 2000s. When we include shocks to expectations about housing finance conditions, the model's ability to match house values improves significantly. The framework reconciles the observed disconnect between house prices and rents since, in general equilibrium, financial shocks can decrease rents and increase prices. © 2019 American Economic Association.

Design/methodology/approach: A workshop based on the scanning-based foresight method (SBFM) was conducted. Social change scenarios were created by participants browsed scanning materials about futuristic topics. Then, energy and society scenarios were produced by combining social change scenarios and future issues describing S&T related to energy in Japan in the future. Findings: The participants who have different scientific and technological experties produced various images of Japan’s energy society around the year 2050. Based on these depictions, future visions of scenarios about energy and society were different in terms of consistency between S&T and future needs from current visions which focus on the transient of social awareness. The sociocentric view and confidence in self-made technology were found in the workshop and the participants believed some social problems would be solved with rich experiences and expertises in S&T even if human resources were limited. It was also found that each scenario portrayed an optimistic view of the relatively near future, in which innovative energy-related technologies are developed to optimize both personal satisfaction and social efficiency. On the other hand, we found rather pessimistic survival scenarios about the far future as concerns climate change and natural disasters. Originality/value: Experts from several fields used their insight to apprehend an energy future and depicted, from scientific and technological perspectives, a vision of a different future society from the one that would emerge in a traditional linear scenario in which a proper balance is struck between the usage of S&T and its limitations. SBFM was also found to be beneficial for insight into energy S&T with its many uncertainties. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Energy and society scenarios; Future issues; Horizon scanning; Science and technology; Social change scenarios",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Benzećri, J.P., (1992) Correspondence Analysis Handbook, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL; (2017) Workshop report: practice on creating a future energy society scenario (in Japanese), , Japan Science and Technology Agency; (2016) National energy and environment strategy for technological innovation towards 2050 (NESTI 2050), , Cabinet Office of Japan; Cuhls, K., Meissner, D., Gokhberg, L., Sokolov, A., Foresight in Germany: implications for policy making (2015) Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy for the Future, pp. 199-217. , and (Eds), Springer, Heidelberg New York, NY, Dordrecht; Furue, N., Washida, Y., Scanning and design thinking: organizational roles for innovation (2017) Foresight, 19 (4), pp. 337-353; (2017) Long-term low-carbon vision, , Ministry of the Environment of Japan; Honda, H., Washida, Y., Sudo, A., Wajima, Y., Awata, K., Ueda, K., The difference in foresight using the scanning method between experts and non-experts (2017) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 119, pp. 18-26; Kishita, Y., McLellanc, C., Giurco, D., Aoki, K., Yoshizawa, G., Handoh, I., Designing backcasting scenarios for resilient energy futures (2017) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 124, pp. 114-125; Lesca, N., (2013) Environmental Scanning and Sustainable Development, , JohnWiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ; Loveridge, D., (2008) Foresight: The Art and Science of Anticipating the Future, , Routledge, Abingdon; Meissner, D., Gokhberg, L., Sokolov, A., Meissner, D., Gokhberg, L., Sokolov, A., The meaning of foresight for science, technology and innovation policy (2015) Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy for the Future, pp. 1-30. , and (Eds), Springer, Heidelberg New York, NY, Dordrecht; (2017) The Long-Term Climate Change Policy Platform Compiles a Report; Mueller, G., Smith, J.B., Six ‘commandments’ for successful futures studies for corporate planning (1984) Journal of Business Strategy, 5 (2), pp. 88-92. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/eb039063, (accessed: 19 November 2018; Popper, R., How are foresight methods selected?

The current study investigates the relationship among belief in a just world (BJW), sense of control, and discounting rate, especially the mediating effect of sense of control between BJW and discounting rate. The study recruited 412 undergraduates to complete a BJW scale, Sense of Control scale, and the Monetary Choice Questionnaire. The results show that (1) BJW positively predicted sense of control, (2) BJW and sense of control were negatively correlated with discounting rate, and (3) sense of control completely mediated the associations between BJW and discounting rate. These findings extend those of prior studies and indicate that a sense of control underlies the association between BJW and discounting rate. © The Author(s) 2019.","Belief in a just world; Delay discounting rate; Sense of control",,,,,,"Alessi, S.M., Petry, N.M., Pathological gambling severity is associated with impulsivity in a delay discounting procedure (2003) Behavioural Processes, 64, pp. 345-354; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423; Bai, B.Y., Liu, X.X., Kou, Y., Belief in a just world lowers perceived intention of corruption: The mediating role of perceived punishment (2014) PloS One, 9; Bai, B.Y., Liu, X.X., Shang, S.J., Zhong, N., Zhang, Q.P., Body shortness lowers belief in a just world: The mediating role of life satisfaction (2016) Personality and Individual Differences, 101, pp. 366-370; Bickel, W.K., Yi, R., Landes, R.D., Hill, P.F., Baxter, C., Remember the future: Working memory training decreases delay discounting among stimulant addicts (2011) Biological Psychiatry, 69, pp. 260-265; Businelle, M.S., McVay, M.A., Kendzor, D., Copeland, A., A comparison of delay discounting among smokers, substance abusers, and non-dependent controls (2010) Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 112, pp. 247-250; Callan, M.J., Harvey, A.J., Dawtry, R.J., Sutton, R.M., Through the looking glass: Focusing on long-term goals increases immanent justice reasoning (2013) British Journal of Social Psychology, 52, pp. 377-385; Callan, M.J., Shead, N.W., Olson, J.M., Foregoing the labor for the fruits: The effect of just world threat on the desire for immediate monetary rewards (2009) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45, pp. 246-249; Cao, F., Su, L., Internet addiction among chinese adolescents: Prevalence and psychological features (2007) Child: Care, Health and Development, 33, pp. 275-281; Chou, K.L., Chi, I., Financial strain and depressive symptoms in Hong Kong elderly chinese: The moderating or mediating effect of sense of control (2001) Aging & Mental Health, 5, pp. 23-30; Chou, K.L., Chi, I., Stressful life events and depressive symptoms: Social support and sense of control as mediators or moderators?

The findings indicate that the inflow of remittances leads to appreciation of the nominal exchange rate and increase of money supply under the fixed exchange rate regime. Moreover, a greater degree of openness helps mitigate the appreciation. These findings suggest that remittances and the degree of openness play a significant role in complementing monetary and exchange rate policy, helping to boost economic development. Using a sample of 114 developing countries from 1970 to 2013, empirical tests with both Anderson-Hsiao with instrumental variables and system generalized method of moments’ estimations confirm the theoretical findings. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","exchange rate; migrants’ remittances; money supply; “openness”",,,,,,"Acosta, P., Calderón, C., Fajnzylber, P., López, H., What is the impact of international remittances on poverty and inequality in Latin America?

In the context of industrial biotechnology, we propose that the extent to which an innovation is expected to be disruptive, and the location of that disruption in existing value chains, are relevant to policy decision making on how to govern innovative technologies. Policy decisions on how to regulate or support an innovative technology will be among the most important factors determining the extent to which it is able to deliver its disruptive potential, leading to sectoral transformations through new business models and value chains. This mode of thinking about disruption and innovation could be incorporated in standard procedures for policy makers to guide decisions designed to support translation from basic scientific research to societally useful products and processes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","foresight; industrial biotechnolopgy; radical/disruptive innovation; Science & technology and innovation policy studies",,,,,,"Banda, G., Tait, J., Watkins, A., Omidvar, O., Business Modelling and Value Chains (2019) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, , this issue), and, press; (2018), https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/synbio/building-business-biodesign, Building the Business of Biodesign: The Synthetic Biology Industry is Ready to Change Gear.

APPROACH: Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review was employed. FINDINGS: Eight final categories of Islamic values (i.e., honesty, piety, foresight, dignity, justice, good temperament, widened heart, and certainty to God) and nine final categories of Western values in health services management (i.e., honesty, freedom, forgiveness, altruism, justice, dignity, responsibility, tolerance, and wisdom) were extracted in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed some discrepancy between Islamic and Western ethical values, which are partially due to a different definition of values in Islam and the West. IMPLICATIONS: The comparison of ethical values can facilitate the exchange of intellectual, cultural, and experimental ideas between Islamic and Western healthcare management. © 2019 NANDA International, Inc.","Ethical principles;

Moreover, the increasing rate of technological developments allowed policy and strategy makers to think about technology emergence for proactive planning. In this sense, technological emergence became popular with different applications and foresight studies. However, even though it is a popular concept in the literature, an accepted formal definition is lacking. In this study, we propose a definition based on review as; “Technological emergence is a cyclic process in highly creative scientific networks that demonstrates qualitative novelty, qualitative synergy, trend irregularity, high functionality, and continuity aspects in a specified time frame”. We discuss and explain the definition by demonstrating it in a multi-dimensional model to make it understandable and applicable for future studies. Finally, we discuss it with existing literature and propose future implications. © 2019","Concept; Emergence; Emerging technology; Review; Technological emergence","Education; Reviews; Concept; Emergence; Emerging technologies; Multi-dimensional model; Philosophy of science; Technological development; Technological emergence; Technology and Innovation Policy; Economic and social effects",,,,,"Solow, R.M., Technical change and the aggregate production function (1957) Rev.

The foresight of leaders in the early 20th century helped Japan to become a founding member of the International Astronomical Union. In this paper, a brief description will show the growth in its more recent history with particular emphasis on two important issues: large research facilities and women participation. On the ground or above, the large observational facilities are nowadays outside of the land of Japan, not only in terms of physical presence but also the community they serve. Domestic membership of the Astronomical Society of Japan at the same time is expanding, thanks to the increased opportunities for women. Continuing global cooperation with more diverse composition of members are the keys for sustaining the growth to carry the astronomy in Japan with IAU into the next century, and hopefully to another planet. © International Astronomical Union 2019.","astronomical collaboration; astronomy in Japan; Development; growth of astronomy; history of astronomy; sustainability of astronomy",,,,,,,"Hayashi, S.S.; TMT-Japan Project Office, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, National Institutes of Natural SciencesJapan; email: saeko@naoj.org",,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,17439213,,,,"English","Proc.

To avoid the weakness of using only scientific papers or patents to study the development trends of emerging technologies, this paper proposes a framework that uses scientific papers and patents as data resources and integrates the text mining and expert judgment approaches to identify technology evolution paths and forecast technology development trends within the short term. The perovskite solar cell technology is selected as a case study. In this case, the text mining and expert judgment methods are applied to analyze the technology evolution path, and gaps analysis between science and technology is used to forecast the technology development trend.

Bouchard began phenotyping exercise as early as 1976, when he correlated variables with skeletal maturity and chronological age in 8–18-year-old boys. Exercise is stress. Stress has numerous definitions. The operational definition for stress used is an increased blood cortisol concentration. As such, maximal exercise effort is one of the greatest stressors to the body. An underlying reason for intense exercise, and thus intense stress, was postulated by Charles Darwin. On a statistical basis, those who are physically unfit are more likely to be eliminated prior to their being able to reach reproductive age. The effect of exercise can be better elucidated by exercise in the absence of gravity. Weight-bearing exercise is necessary to prevent bone loss. Nongravity exercise such as cycling is associated with a seven times increased likelihood to have spine osteopenia than running. © selection and editorial matter, J. Timothy Lightfoot, Monica J.

Much human loss and unnecessary destruction of infrastructure can be avoided with more foresight and specific planning. Most of the people die due to lack of medicines and proper treatment so it is necessary to supply first aid medicines right after any severe disaster. The goal of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model that involves transporting medicines from different supply sources to different distribution centers in response to Cyclones in the southwest coastal areas of Bangladesh to maximize the survival rate of the affected population, which is modeled using linear programming in order to find the optimal quantity of cartons containing medicines which will be supplied to affected people and also the optimal transportation cost and time.

However, the dynamic comprehension and foresight of alternative evolutionary paths available are a further challenge for scientists and decision makers, called to afford the complexity and turbulence of a socio-economic context in continuous change. Aimed at contributing to the discussion on the knowledge-based development of countries, the paper focuses on Ghana by adopting a system dynamic approach for exploring the nature and impacts of the interactions between academia (university) and industry (market), by highlighting areas of causality, relationship and addictions. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Ecosystem; Ghana; Innovation system; Knowledge-based economy; System dynamics; Triple helix",,,,,,"Aghion, P., Howitt, P., Prantl, S., The effects of entry on incumbent innovation and productivity (2012) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 91 (1), pp. 20-32. , 20; Asheim, B.T., Gertler, M.S., The geography of innovation: Regional innovation systems (2005) The Oxford Handbook of Innovation, pp. 291-317. , Fagerberg, J., Mowery, D. and Nelson, R.

It explains the aim of the centres, their mode of operation and their organisational structure, based on the centres' main paradigms. To understand their stunning growth and success, it is crucial to perceive how they bring their members to understand what is called the 'law of cause and effect' concerning everyone's actions. Once a person understands this law of cause and effect, one can use it to transform his or her life. A Thabarwa centre is the place where any person can abandon creating causes for suffering (understood in the Buddhist sense) and instead make causes for good results.

To investigate these dynamics, a program for regional collaboration initiated jointly by the governments of China, Japan, and South Korea was taken as a case study. Co-authored publication outputs, annual project reports, and interviews with program participants at Japanese universities were analyzed using selected theories from the field of International Relations. The interviews explored the ideas researchers had about the potential for the indirect effects of collaborations to spill over into other arenas, and the barriers faced which impeded regional cooperation. The findings suggest that while a number of barriers exist, the program has contributed to ongoing knowledge production and regional collaboration, societal integration, and the cultivation of a generation of regionally-networked young researchers. © 2019, The Author(s).","East Asia; Epistemic communities; Higher education regionalism; Regional integration; Research collaboration",,,,,,"Adler, E., Haas, P., (2008) Conclusion: Epistemic communities, world order, and the creation of a reflective research program author (s): Emanuel Adler and Peter M.

At the same time, territorial cohesion in Europe is challenged by the dominant role of urban areas in territorial development and in territorial development policies. One may conclude that the urban perspective and territorial cohesion cannot do without each other, but at the same time, they risk to wreck each other. This contribution will further explore this complicated relation. Starting with the growing importance of urban areas, the first section will address the increasing concentration of economic and demographic growth in Europe to urban areas (Böhme and Lüer 2017; ESPON 2017, 2018). Based on the idea that cities act as motors for territorial development in a wider region, over the past decades they have become the centre points for development and future perspectives.

This study aims to conceptualise resilient safety culture of construction projects by integrating resilience engineering principles into the concept of safety culture. A correlation research design was adopted to achieve the research objectives and hypotheses. Data were collected using questionnaires with 78 completed building projects. The structural equation modelling technique was used to analyse the data collected. The results of this study (1) confirmed 24 measurable questions to assess resilient safety culture; (2) supported the hypothesized significant positive relationship between resilient safety culture and safety performance. The findings of this study imply that resilient safety culture can be used as a predictor of safety performance. It also provides a frame of practices to assess organisations’ capability of safety management in the construction environment. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Construction; Resilience; Safety culture; Safety management; Safety performance","Construction; Human engineering; Surveys; Complex sociotechnical systems; Construction environment; Resilience; Resilience engineerings; Safety culture; Safety management; Safety performance; Structural equation modelling; Safety engineering",,,,,"Bergström, J., van Winsen, R., Henriqson, E., On the rationale of resilience in the domain of safety: A literature review (2015) Reliab.

Regrettably, though, these doctrines' analyses of race, racial identity, and the relationships between race and politics often lack sophistication, historical context, or foresight. The political status quo is treated as race-neutral, when in fact it is anything but. Specifically, the doctrines rely upon sanguine theories of democracy uncorrupted by white identity-based political calculations, while in fact such calculations, made on the part of both voters and political parties, are pervasive. In this Article, I appraise the doctrine pertaining to majority-minority voting districts, racial gerrymandering doctrine, the doctrine governing ballot access disputes, and campaign finance doctrine through the lens of white identity politics. Drawing from research in political science, sociology, and history, I argue that these doctrines are blighted by what I identify as “racial blind spots” that are inconsonant with political reality. Given the role that courts play in enunciating these doctrines, their failure to meaningfully engage with the significance of white identity politics renders their governing frameworks and remedial prescriptions inapt. The Article concludes by offering a number of suggestions, both doctrinal and legislative, for how to mitigate white identity politics. © 2019 Fordham University School of Law.

These developments include changes in the cultural presence, the production and dissemination of games, which in turn have led to changes in their content and forms. This paper investigates to what extend such game sector developments have been utilized by games in a futures context, and building on this analysis, where the key opportunities are to leverage game sector developments to advance the field of futures games. Connections are made between game sector developments on the one hand and alternate reality games, massively multiplayer games, experiential futures games, online video games, game design engines and game jams on the other. Key recommendations resulting from this analysis include researching new player bases, adapting existing games, blurring the lines between commercial games and futures games, developing new futures games design and dissemination infrastructure, integrating futures games and present action, and organizing new funding mechanisms for futures games. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Co-design; Experiential Futures; Foresight; Futures; Game sector; Games","design; future prospect; industrial development; media industry; virtual reality",,,,,"Abrami, G., Ferrand, N., Morardet, S., Murgue, C., Popova, A., De Fooij, H., Wat-A-Game, a toolkit for building role-playing games about integrated water management (2012) iEMSs 2012 – Managing resources of a limited planet: Proceedings of the 6th biennial meeting of the international environmental modelling and software society, pp. 1912-1919; Alessi, S., Kopainsky, B., System dynamics and simulation/gaming: Overview (2015) Simulation and Gaming, 46, pp. 223-229; Althoff, T., White, R.W., Horvitz, E., Influence of pokémon go on physical activity: Study and implications (2016) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 18; Baena, A.B.M., Gaming futures: To experience scenarios through Teatro Del Devenir (2017) Journal of Futures Studies, 22, pp. 119-124; Ballard, C., Hrehovcsik, M., Vervoort, J.M., The TRANSMANGO European game jam tour: Building games together to help imagine and experiment with the many futures of food, FP7 TRANSMANGO (2018), https://transmango.wordpress.com/2018/01/10/the-transmango-european-game-jam-tour/; Banks, J., Co-creating videogames (2012), Bloomsbury Academic; Bendor, R., Analytic and deictic approaches to the design of sustainability decision-support tools (2012) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 215-222; Bendor, R., Anacleto, J., Facey, D., Fels, S., Herron, T., Maggs, D., Sustainability in an imaginary world (2015) Interactions, 22, pp. 54-57; Bendor, R., Maggs, D., Peake, R., Robinson, J., Williams, S., The imaginary worlds of sustainability: Observations from an interactive art installation (2017) Ecology and Society, 22; Bennett, E.M., Solan, M., Biggs, R., McPhearson, T., Norström, A.V., Olsson, P., Bright spots: Seeds of a good Anthropocene (2016) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 14, pp. 441-448; Bhatti, Y., Selin, C., Ramirez, R., Chermack, T., Introduction to the special issue in futures on design and scenarios (2015) Futures, 74, pp. 1-3; Billinghurst, M., Clark, A., Lee, G., A survey of augmented reality (2014) Foundations and Trends in Human-Computer Interaction, 8, pp. 73-272; Bishop, I.D., Landscape planning is not a game: Should it be?

Such modeling is theory-driven, grounded in expert judgment and understanding, and can be contrasted with data-driven modeling approaches. Several families of approaches exist to enable expert elicited systems modeling with varying input information requirements and analytical ambitions. This paper proposes a novel modeling language and computational process, which combines aspects from various other approaches in an attempt to create a flexible and practical systems modeling approach based on expert elicitation. It is intended to have high fitness in modeling of systems that lack statistical data and exhibit low quantifiability of important system characteristics. AXIOM is positioned against Bayesian networks, cross-impact analysis, structural analysis, and morphological analysis. The modeling language and computational process are illustrated with a small example model. A software implementation is also presented. © 2018 The Author","Belief networks; Cross-impact analysis; Decision support; Expert elicitation; Modeling techniques; Systems modeling","Bayesian networks; Computation theory; Decision making; Decision support systems; Cross-impact analysis; Decision supports; Expert elicitation; Modeling technique; Systems modeling; Modeling languages; Bayesian analysis; decision support system; modeling; network analysis; software",,,,,"Acid, S., de Campos, L.M., Fernandez-Luna, J.M., Rodriguez, S., Rodriguez, J.M., Salcedo, J.L., A comparison of learning algorithms for Bayesian networks: a case study based on data from an emergency medical service (2004) Artif.

While techniques such as business wargaming can effectively support this process, such techniques can benefit from placing competitive considerations within a broader future landscape shaped by geopolitical, social, technological and economic forces. Scenario planning allows for the exploration of interactions across multiple external forces to create a rich set of narratives on how the future may unfold. This paper will discuss the potential of combining scenario planning and business wargaming to enable strategists to anticipate moves and countermoves and foresee their consequences. We use a real-life case study to illustrate how a scenario-planning exercise can guide the crucial stage of selecting relevant future competitors of a firm prior to engaging in a business-war-gaming exercise. We then introduce what we term the prospective competitive strategy process to guide the analysis of potential competitive dynamics, emphasizing the synergies between scenario planning and business wargaming. © 2018 The Authors","Business war gaming; Competitive landscape; Foresight; Scenario planning","business cycle; competitiveness; planning process; strategic approach",,,,,"Amer, M., Daim, T.U., Jetter, A., A review of scenario planning (2013) Futures, pp. 23-40; Ashton, W.B., Johnson, A.H., Stacey, G.S., Monitoring science and technology for competitive advantage (1994) Competitive Intelligence Review, 5 (1), pp. 5-16; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, Sage Publications (Journal of Management), 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Battistella, C., De Toni, A.F., A methodology of technological foresight: A proposal and field study (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (6), pp. 1029-1048; Beal, R.M., Competing effectively: Environmental scanning, competitive strategy, and organizational performance in small manufacturing firms (2000) Journal of Small Business Management, 38 (1), pp. 27-47; Bergeron, P., Hiller, C.A., Competitive intelligence (2005) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 36 (1), pp. 353-390; Bidmon, C.M., Knab, S.F., The three roles of business models in societal transitions: New linkages between business model and transition research’ (2017) Journal of Cleaner Production (Elsevier Ltd.), 178, pp. 903-916; Blank, S., Why the lean start-up changes everything (2013) Harvard Business Review, pp. 65-72; Bodwell, W., Chermack, T.J., Organizational ambidexterity: Integrating deliberate and emergent strategy with scenario planning (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (2), pp. 193-202; Bogner, W.C., Barr, P.S., Making sense in hypercompetitive environments: A cognitive explanation for the persistence of high velocity competition (2000) Organization Science, 11 (2), pp. 212-226; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Cairns, G., Goodwin, P., Wright, G., A decision-analysis-based framework for analysing stakeholder behaviour in scenario planning (2016) European Journal of Operational Research, 249 (3), pp. 1050-1062; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, (11), pp. 67-79; Coyle, G., Practical strategy: Structured tools and technique (2004), Pearson Harlow; Daheim, C., Uerz, G., Corporate foresight in Europe: From trend based logics to open foresight (2008) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 20 (3), pp. 321-336; Dannenberg, S., Fischer, N., Gaming scenarios: Making sense of diverging developments (2017) Journal of Futures Studies, 22 (2), pp. 15-26; Dator, J., Why gaming, why alternative futures?

Different specifications for the monetary policy rule are analyzed, namely a so-called current, forward, or backward-looking feedback rule, depending on whether the monetary authority uses the actual, expected, or last observed values of the inflation rate to set the monetary policy. We study how the responsiveness of the policy rule with respect to inflation affects the determinacy of the monetary equilibrium. A policy rule is called aggressive (moderate) if it responds strongly (moderately) to inflation deviations from the target. We show how aggressive feedback rules, depending on the considered timing, can reinforce mechanisms that lead to indeterminacy or may lead the inflation rate to fluctuate around the monetary equilibrium at which monetary policy is aggressive. A leaning against the wind policy seems to be more desirable from an equilibrium determinacy point of view. On the contrary, a leaning with the wind policy could not be the recommended policy for the Central Bank. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Indeterminacy; Monetary Policy Rules; OLG Model; Perfect Foresight Equilibrium",,,,,,"Benhabib, J., Schmitt-Grohe, S., Uribe, M., Monetary policy and multiple equilibria (2001) American Economic Review, 91 (1), pp. 167-186; Benhabib, J., Schmitt-Grohe, S., Uribe, M., The perils of Taylor rules (2001) Journal of Economic Theory, 96 (1), pp. 40-69; Benhabib, J., Schmitt-Grohe, S., Uribe, M., Chaotic interest-rate rules (2002) American Economic Review, 92 (2), pp. 72-78; Benhabib, J., Schmitt-Grohe, S., Uribe, M., Backward-looking interest-rate rules, interest-rate smoothing, and macroeconomic instability (2003) Journal of Money, Credit & Banking, 35 (6), pp. 1379-1412; Bernanke, B.S., Woodford, M., (1997) Inflation Forecasts and Monetary Policy, , NBER working paper 6157, National Bureau of Economic Research; Bischi, G.I., Marimon, R., Global stability of inflation target policies with adaptive agents (2001) Macroeconomic Dynamics, 5 (2), pp. 148-179; Bullard, J., Learning equilibria (1994) Journal of Economic Theory, 64 (2), pp. 468-485; Bullard, J., (2012) Inflation Targeting in the USA.

This is especially true for Russia, which is still at a transitional (postsocialist) stage of its history. The conceptualization of the Russia post-socialist future requires the rehabilitation in the national social science concepts of capitalism and socialism epistemological status, without which it is impossible to analyze the current situation in Russia from the dialectical logic standpoint of the of world history. Considering this situation in the framework of the «thesis-antithesis-synthesis» paradigm, acad. V.S. Nersesyants proposed the theory of civilism as a social system that could emerge by desocialization of socialist property in accordance with the legal principle of formal equality in freedom. The article provides an analysis of the theoretical content and practical significance of this theory for understanding and transforming modern social realities. © 2019 Russian Academy of Sciences.

Norway is often considered the country where modern skiing began, yet its climate change risk remains largely unknown. The SkiSim2 model is run with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission climate futures to analyse implications for ski season at 110 alpine ski areas in Norway in the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s with only natural snow and with advanced snowmaking. A considerable shortening of the ski season in projected as early as the 2030s for the half of ski areas that currently lack snowmaking. Naturally snow reliable ski areas decline from approximately half in the 2030s to a third in the 2050s. With snowmaking, ski season losses are substantially reduced and the majority of ski areas remain snow reliable until the end of the twenty-first century in a lower emission future. A substantial shortening of the ski season (up to 40 days) nonetheless begins in the 2050s under a high emission scenario. The need to invest in snowmaking will continue to increase, with attendant financial and sustainability implications. The differential climate risk among five regions of Norway and the European Alps is also discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate change; Ski industry; snowmaking; sustainability",,,,,,"Aall, C., Hall, M.C., Groven, K., Tourism: Applying rebound theories and mechanisms to climate change mitigation and adaptation (2016) How to improve energy and climate policies.

Modelling of consumer exposure needs input information on the substance (e.g. vapour pressure), the product(s) containing the substance (e.g. concentration) and on consumer behaviour (e.g. use frequency and amount of product used). This feasibility study in Germany investigated methods for conducting a consumer survey in order to identify and retrieve information on frequency, duration, use amounts and use conditions for six example product types (four mixtures, two articles): hand dishwashing liquid, cockpit spray, fillers, paints and lacquers, shoes made of rubber or plastic, and ball-pens/pencils. Retrospective questionnaire methods (Consumer Product Questionnaire (CPQ), and Recall-Foresight Questionnaire (RFQ)) as well as protocol methods (written reporting by participants and video documentation) were used. A combination of retrospective questionnaire and written protocol methods was identified to provide valid information in a resource-efficient way. Relevant information, which can readily be used in exposure modelling, was obtained for all parameters and product types investigated. Based on the observations in this feasibility study, recommendations are given for designing a large consumer survey. © 2018, The Author(s).","Amount; Consumer survey; Duration; Exposure scenarios; Frequency; REACH",,,,,,"Prud’homme de Lodder, L.C.H., Bremmer, H.J., van Engelen, J.G.M., (2006) Cleaning products fact sheet, , RIVM, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, Bilthoven, Netherlands: RIVM report 320104003/2006; Bremmer, H.J., van Engelen, J.G.M., (2007) Paint products fact sheet, , RIVM, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, Bilthoven, Netherlands: RIVM report 320104008/2007; ter Burg, W., Bremmer, H.J., van Engelen, J.G.M., (2007) Do-it-yourself products fact sheet, , RIVM, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, Bilthoven, Netherlands: RIVM report 320104007/2007; Bremmer, H.J., van Veen, M.P., (2002) Children’s toys fact sheet, , RIVM, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, Bilthoven, Netherlands: RIVM Report 612810012/2002; Oltmanns, J., Neisel, F., Heinemeyer, G., Kaiser, E., Schneider, K., Consumer exposure modelling under REACH: assessing the defaults (2015) Regul Toxicol Pharmacol, 72, pp. 222-230. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC2MjnsVynsg%3D%3D; Johnson, A., Lucica, E., (2012) Survey on Indoor Use and Use Patterns of Consumer Products in Eu Member States. - Survey Report -, , https://esites.vito.be/sites/ephect/Working%20documents/EPHECT%20Final%20Meeting%20Posters/3.%20Poster%20Market%20study.pdf; Dimitroulopoulou, C., Lucica, E., Johnson, A., Ashmore, M.R., Sakellaris, I., Stranger, M., Goelen, E., EPHECT I: European household survey on domestic use of consumer products and development of worst-case scenarios for daily use (2015) Sci Total Environ, 536, pp. 880-889. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXosVahtrk%3D; Dimitroulopoulou, C., Trantallidi, M., Carrer, P., Efthimiou, G.C., Bartzis, J.G., EPHECT II: exposure assessment to household consumer products (2015) Sci Total Environ, 536, pp. 890-902. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhtFGkurvI; Garcia-Hidalgo, E., von Goetz, N., Siegrist, M., Hungerbühler, K., Use-patterns of personal care and household cleaning products in Switzerland (2017) Food Chem Toxicol, 99, pp. 24-39. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC28XhvFGru7%2FJ; Consumer Product Ingredient Safety (2010) Exposure and Risk Screening Methods for Consumer Product Ingredients, , http://www.aciscience.org/docs/Consumer_Product_Ingredient_Safety_v2.0.pdf, 2nd ed, Washington, DC; (2005), http://www.heraproject.com/files/hera%20tgd%20february%202005.pdf, HERA, Human & Environmental Risk Assessment on Ingredients of Household Cleaning Products.

To determine the possibility of using predicative (predictive) analytics in the management of single-industry cities, the authors consider the main problems associated with the development and implementation of strategies and programs for the development of mono-profile settlements. In addition, they determine possible directions and possibilities of using predictive analytics (in aggregate, for example, with foresight) in managing the development of single-industry towns: developing and improving state programs to support single-industry towns; forming a strategy for smart specialization; selecting priorities for innovative development; searching for sources of a unique strategy of a single-industry town; foreseeing innovative changes; managing risks of implementing strategies and programs; developing TASED, managing technical risks of enterprises. The authors made a preliminary choice of possible predictors. The results of the research can be helpful in developing the regional economy in terms of tools for long-term planning and forecasting the transformation of economies and societies of singleindustry towns. © 2019, Revista Espacios.El objetivo del artículo es analizar las posibilidades de utilizar el análisis predictivo en la gestión del desarrollo de ciudades de una sola industria (a) para corroborar las tendencias en la modernización de las economías de una sola industria, (b) desarrollar, supervisar y corregir proyectos para la diversificación, y (c) para formar y desarrollar territorios avanzados de desarrollo social y económico (TASED) en ciudades de una sola industria.

The solubility issues affect not only its onset of action but also the bioavailability. These drawbacks foresight the need to have an alternate dosage form, preferably a sustained release formulation. Methods: In the present study, microparticles were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation using PLGA 50:50 (GEF-PLGA MP). A 32 factorial design was used to optimize the critical quality parameters to the set mean particle size in the range of 7.4±2.5 µm and entrapment efficiency of 80%. SEM microscopy of the prepared microparticles confirmed to have a spherical smooth shape. The GEF-PLGA-MPs sustained the release of GEF for 72 hours. The first-order kinetics ruled the mechanism of drug release and was predicted to follow Fickian diffusion. Result: Anticancer efficacy was judged by the cytotoxicity studies using the L132 lung cancer cells. MTT assay showed 3-fold enhanced cytotoxicity of GEF loaded microparticles against L132 cells as compared to plain GEF. Conclusion: It was concluded that gefitinib can be efficiently loaded into the biodegradable polymer PLGA to provide sustained release of the drug. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cytotoxicity; Factorial design; Gefitinib; Microparticles; PLGA; Sustained release","Article; controlled study; human; human cell; priority journal; sustained drug release",,,,,"Thomas, S.M., Grandis, J.R., Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of EGFR inhibitors under clinical investigation (2004) Cancer Treat.

Consequently, flexibility for the numerical experimentation, PSO has been used to resolve diverse kind of optimization problems. PSO is much of the time caught in local optima in the meantime taking care of the complex real-world problems.Considering this, a novel modified PSO is introduced by proposing a chi square mutation method. The main functionality of mutation operator in PSO is quick convergence and escapes from the local minima. Population initialization plays a critical role in meta-heuristic algorithm. Moreover, in this work, to improve the convergence, rather applying random distribution for initialization, two quasi random sequences Halton and Sobol have been applied and properly joined with chi-square mutated PSO (Chi-Square PSO) algorithm. The promising experimental result suggests the superiority of the proposed technique. The results present foresight that how the proposed mutation operator influences on the value of cost function and divergence. The proposed mutated strategy is applied for eight (8) benchmark functions extensively used in the literature. The simulation results verify that Chi-Square PSO provide efficient results over other tested algorithms implemented for the function optimization. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Chi-Square mutation; Particle Swarm Optimization; Population initialization",,,,,,"Bangyal, W.H., Ahmad, J., Rauf, H.T., Pervaiz, S., An improved bat algorithm based on novel initialization technique for global optimization problem (2018) International journal of advanced computer science and applications, 9 (7), pp. 158-166; Bangyal, W.H., Ahmad, J., Rauf, H.T., Pervaiz, S., An overview of mutation strategies in bat algorithm (2018) international journal of advanced computer science and applications, 9 (8), pp. 523-534; Jana, N.D., Sil, J., Das, S., Particle swarm optimization with population adaptation (2014) Evolutionary Computation (CEC), 2014 IEEE Congress on.

Transforming consumption and production processes is a fundamental priority of this development agenda. Circular Economy has emerged as an alternative model, given its potential for value creation, while generating social and environmental positive impacts. An exploratory study carried out in Navarra (Spain) shows its potentiality for socio-economic and environmental benefits as well as technological, organizational, financial, institutional and social challenges. However, through the lenses of care ethics and gender, we argue that Circular Economy entails a wider range of opportunities and defies for entrepreneurs, organizations, institutions, economics and society as a whole. The transformational changes at societal level that it implies and the complexity of socio-ecological systems make necessary a holistic approach and foresight to design strategies, policies and programs to turn economic activities into loops of care for people and the environment. Circular Economy frameworks, methodologies and tools need to strengthen its social dimension. Appropriate institutional arrangements and strategic leadership are necessary to make this paradigm shift contribute towards sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Ethic of care; Future studies; Gender economics; Patterns of production and consumption; Public ethic; Sustainable development","consumption behavior; ethics; future prospect; gender relations; paradigm shift; socioeconomic status; sustainable development; Navarra; Spain",,,,,"Acker, J., Hierarchies, jobs and bodies.

I focus on this latter, outcome-oriented notion of RRI and discuss two kinds of problems. The first one concerns options to anticipate the future course of science and technology. Such foresight knowledge seems necessary for subjecting research to demands of social and moral responsibility. However, predicting science and technology is widely considered impossible. The second problem concerns moral evaluation. The benefit or harm produced by certain research and innovation achievements is often hard to estimate. Against this background of uncertainty in factual and moral assessment, I explore opportunities left for RRI. First, RRI should contribute to maintaining a wide range of approaches. Second, judgments about RRI should draw on zones of convergence among the variety of research approaches pursued. Third, decisions about implementing a technology should be revisable. Fourth, the more specific inclusion of demands from society should be reserved to technology development. Fifth, in many respects, the social compatibility of a new technology is due rather to the social context than the inherent features of the product. Favorable circumstances are transparency, representation of all relevant parties, and procedural fairness. As a result, some of the benefits and detriments of research and innovation can be identified without detailed knowledge of future findings. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Responsibility of science; Science and society; Social epistemology",,,,,,"Biddle, J., Lessons from the Vioxx debacle: What the privatization of science can teach us about social epistemology (2007) Social Epistemology, 21, pp. 21-39; Blok, V., Lemmens, P., The emerging concept of responsible innovation.

If timed and provisioned well, successful technology substitutions can provide significant market advantages to firms that have anticipated the demand correctly for emergent technologies. Conversely, failure to commit to new technologies at the right time can have catastrophic consequences, making determining the likely substitution mode of critical strategic importance. With little available data, being able to identify at an early stage whether new technologies are appearing in response to the perceived stagnation in existing technical developments, or as a result of pioneering leaps of scientific foresight, poses a significant challenge. This paper combines bibliometric, pattern recognition, and statistical approaches to develop a technology classification model from historical datasets where literature evidence supports mode labeling. The resulting functional linear regression model demonstrates robust predictive capabilities for the technologies considered, supporting the literature-based substitution framework applied and providing evidence suggesting that substitution modes can be recognized through automated processing of patent data. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that classification can be achieved based on partial time series, implying that future extensions to real-time classifications may be possible for decision-making in the early stages of research and development. © 2013 IEEE.","Adner's classification scheme; emergence; patent bibliometrics; pattern recognition; technological substitutions; technology life cycle","Classification (of information); Data handling; Decision making; Life cycle; Patents and inventions; Regression analysis; Bibliometrics; Catastrophic consequences; Classification scheme; emergence; Linear regression models; Research and development; Technology classifications; Technology life cycle; Pattern recognition",,,,,"Geels, F.W., Schot, J., Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways (2007) Res.

In Spain, various initiatives have been developed at state, regional, local and cross-border levels, which have been integrated into the Spatial Data Infrastructure of Spain. In the case of Santiago de Compostela, a World Heritage historic city, two experiences have taken place: the Heritage Information System (SIP, by its Spanish acronym) and recently the Geoportal of Santiago de Compostela City Council. This work aims to present the experience of both initiatives as tools for heritage management and public knowledge. An evaluation of the design and functionality of the SIP over the 7 years since its implementation has also been carried out. For this purpose, four indicators have been established: use of international and European standards, compatibility, proactivity, and synergies between documentation centers. The study found that despite the functionality that the SIP had in its creation, the lack of foresight to maintain its systematization and updating led to it being outdated. However, the Geoportal of Santiago de Compostela City Council was created as a new tool for disseminating and managing heritage and council services among institutions, professionals and citizens. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Cultural heritage; Management; Spatial data infrastructure","Information use; Management; Public administration; Cultural heritages; European Standards; Geographic information; Heritage managements; Organisational; Pro activities; Public knowledge; Spatial data infrastructure; Information systems",,,,,"Spatial Data Infrastructure Cookbook 2012 Update, , http://gsdiassociation.org/index.php/publications/sdi-cookbooks.html, Accessed 20 Nov 2017; Parcero-Oubiña, C., La arqueología y las infraestructuras de datos espaciales (2016) Manual De tecnologías De La información geográfica Aplicadas a La arqueología, pp. 341-359. , Museo Arqueológico Regional, Madrid; Estévez, X., Santiago de Compostela, conservación y transformación (2001) Arbor, 170 (671-672), pp. 473-488; López-Felpeto, M.A., Carrero, M., Geographic Information Systems applied to urban archaeology: The case of the “SIP” of Santiago de Compostela (2015) SÉMATA, Ciencias Sociais E Humanidades, 27, pp. 349-363; Corns, A., Shaw, R., Cultural heritage Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI)-unlocking the potential of our cultural landscape data (2010) 30Th Earsel Symposium Remote Sensing for Science, Education, and Natural and Cultural Heritage, pp. 1-8. , Rainer, R.

One of the most important factors influencing the long-term success and sustainability of future development is a comprehensive understanding of the region's geologic regime, geotechnical conditions, natural resources, and environmental constraints. To obtain this understanding, the Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME) of the State of Qatar has undertaken the Qatar Geological Mapping Project (QGMP). The project was developed with strategic foresight to compile and utilize existing subsurface data collected as part of its massive infrastructure and development projects. Recently, the MME, in consultation with Gannett Fleming Inc. (GF) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) concluded the data collection and analysis phase (Phase I) of the two-phase QGMP. Phase I included: the development of a comprehensive geotechnical relational database (GRDB) populated with data digitized from more than 13,000 subsurface data logs; a detailed data quality analysis and distribution assessment; an extensive gap analysis and needs assessment; and careful design of the geologic mapping and subsurface investigation programs for the next phase of the project. The comprehensive GRDB will allow the MME, other government agencies, and their representatives, the ability to quickly search, query, and assess available geological and geotechnical data for use in site evaluations, project planning, and decision making. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Decision making; Geological surveys; Geology; Geotechnical engineering; Mapping; Quality control; Query processing; Sustainable development; Data quality analysis; Development project; Environmental constraints; Geotechnical conditions; Government agencies; Relational Database; Subsurface investigations; United states geological surveys; Population statistics",,,,,"(2011) Electronic Transfer of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Data – AGS4, p. 150. , AGS Association of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists Edition 4.0.3 – October 2011, AGS, Kent, UK; Eccleston, B.L., Pike, J.G., Harhash, I., (1981) The Water Resources of Qatar and Their Development: Water Resources and Agricultural Development Project (FAO Funds-inTrust), p. 427. , Ministry of Industry and Agriculture, Government of The State of Qatar Technical Report 5; Embabi, N.S., Ali, A.A., (1990) Geomorphology of Depressions in The Qatar Peninsula, p. 357. , Qatar University, Al-Ahleia Press, Doha; Orndorff, R.C., Knight, M.A., Krupansky, J.T., Al-Akhras, K.M., Stamm, R.G., Abdul Samad, U.S., Ahmed, E., Linking geology and geotechnical engineering in karst – The Qatar geologic mapping project (2018) Proceedings of The 15th Multidisciplinary Conference on Sinkholes and The Engineering and Environmental Impacts of Karst, and The 3rd Appalachian Karst Symposium: National Cave and Karst Research Institute Symposium, 7, pp. 383-391. , Sasowsky, I.D., Byle, M.J., and Land, Lewis, eds; Sadiq, A.M., Nasir, S.J., Middle Pleistocene karst evolution in the State of Qatar, Arabian Gulf (2002) Journal of Cave and Karst Studies, 64 (2), pp. 132-139; (1980) Explanatory Booklet to The Qatar Geologic Map (1:100,000 and 1:200,000 Scale), p. 20. , Seltrust Engineering Limited Seltrust Engineering Limited, London, England, Industrial Development Technical Center, Doha, Qatar; (2017) Middle East: Qatar, p. 9. , U.S. Central Intelligence Agency The World Fact Book",,"Meehan M.L.Kumar S.Coe J.T.Pando M.A.","The Geo-Institute (G-I) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","8th International Conference on Case Histories in Geotechnical Engineering: Data, Software, Education, and a Tribute to Ralph Peck, Geo-Congress 2019","24 March 2019 through 27 March 2019",,146246,08950563,9780784482070; 9780784482087; 9780784482094; 9780784482100; 9780784482117; 9780784482124; 9780784482131; 9780784482148; 9780784482155; 9780784482162,GSPUE,,"English","Geotech Spec Publ",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063450538

Future objects are defined as an array of socio-material entities that underpin future practices. In drawing on science studies, this paper develops a typology of future objects that takes as its ordering mechanism the political work future objects perform. Type one future objects are solid and ready to use. Their political work is to secure the present by allowing for political agreements that concern the future. Based on a linear model of expertise, this type of future object provides answers in speaking truth to power. Bodies and instruments, databases and power points are involved when producing, as well as performing, type one objects. Type two future objects are about the experimental infrastructure for creating futures. Foresight conferences organize space with the aim in mind to come up with novel visions of sustainable futures in the Anthropocene. Finally, type three future objects are more fluid and still in the making. They are collectively worked on in iterative cycles. Examples range from prototypes of climate engineering to negotiation texts of global environmental agreements. They operate as a centering device and materialize in artifacts integrating participants contributions. In outlining the difference between the three object types, the paper elaborates on the environmental politics of anticipation especially with regard to science policy interaction. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Anthropocene; Anticipation; Future; Materiality; Objects",,,,,,"Allan, B.B., Producing the climate: states, scientists, and the constitution of global governance objects (2017) Int Org, 71, pp. 131-162; Allan, B.B., From subjects to objects: knowledge in international relations theory (2017) Eur J Int Relat, 8, pp. 8-9; Andersson, J., (2018) The future of the world: futurology, futurists, and the struggle for the post cold war imagination, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Appadurai, A., (2013) The future as cultural fact.

It is important to screen several ligands and several binding and elution conditions. This allows taking full advantage of these resins. High-Throughput Screening (HTS) for Process Development should be done with the help of Design of Experiment (DoE). It could be performed in filter plates or Robocolumns, and assisted by liquid handling automated workstation. Modeling of the results allows the choice of optimal parameters that can then be validated and scaled up. All this leads to a better knowledge and robustness of the purification step. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","Design of experiment; Design of Experiment (DoE); High throughput process development; High-Throughput Screening (HTS); Large opportunities; Mixed mode chromatography","anion exchange resin; cation exchange resin; ligand; resin; inorganic salt; monoclonal antibody; protein; protein binding; resin; solvent; adsorption chromatography; antigen binding; binding affinity; binding and related phenomena; chromatography; column chromatography; equipment design; experimental design; high throughput screening; hydrophobic interaction chromatography; hydrophobicity; instrument validation; ion exchange chromatography; mixed mode chromatography; pH; pKa; process development; process optimization; protein binding; protein purification; quality control; Review; salt tolerance; surface charge; validation process; workflow; animal; bacterium; chemical phenomena; chemistry; chromatography; devices; eukaryotic cell; factor analysis; high throughput screening; human; isolation and purification; laboratory automation; procedures; static electricity; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Automation, Laboratory; Bacteria; Chromatography; Eukaryotic Cells; Factor Analysis, Statistical; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Ligands; Protein Binding; Proteins; Resins, Synthetic; Salts; Solvents; Static Electricity",,"protein, 67254-75-5; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Ligands; Proteins; Resins, Synthetic; Salts; Solvents","AcroPrep; Biomek FXP, Beckman Coulter, United States; Eshmuno HCX ToyoScreen RoboColumns, GE Healthcare; Foresight RoboColumns, Biorad; Freedom EVO, Tecan, Switzerland; JANUS BioTx Workstation, Perkin Elmer, United States; Predictor RoboColumns, GE Healthcare; RoboColumns; ScreenExpert RoboColumns, GE Healthcare","Tecan, Switzerland; Beckman Coulter, United States; Biorad; GE Healthcare; Perkin Elmer, United States","Yon, R.J., Chromatography of lipophilic proteins on adsorbents containing mixed hydrophobic and ionic groups (1972) Biochem.

Mobile robots need foresight into the quality of their wireless links in order to proactively optimize routing, plan mobility routes, avoid disconnects, and make other network optimizations. However, the task of predicting LQ is nontrivial. Many environmental factors that influence the quality of radio wave propagation are dynamic, and thus, robots must continually learn and update their prediction models while they operate online. Prior work in the field uses online learning algorithms for predicting LQ, but this approach is costly in terms of energy and network capacity because of the need for a consistent stream of LQ labels to be transmitted from the receiver to the transmitter. Hence, this paper introduces a framework to reduce these overhead expenses by incorporating active learning to selectively label only a portion of the samples from the data stream. The framework also uses incremental training batches to conserve labeling resources, and updates the batches using change detection and forgetting mechanisms to mitigate concept drift. Experimental results reveal that the framework reduces label queries by up to 21.5% and prediction error by up to 9% after periods of concept drift. © 2018","Concept drift and cold-start mitigation; Incremental machine learning with forgetting; Single-pass active learning in data streams","Artificial intelligence; E-learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Radio waves; Robots; Wave propagation; Active Learning; Cold start; Environmental factors; Forgetting mechanisms; Incremental learning; Incremental machine learning with forgetting; Incremental training; Online learning algorithms; Learning algorithms",,,,,"Baccour, N., Koubaa, A., Mottola, L., Zuniga, M.A., Youssef, H., Boano, C.A., Alves, M., Radio link quality estimation in wireless sensor networks: a survey (2012) ACM Trans.

The human brain is among the most complex biological structures that humankind is aware of. Understanding it offers the vista of being able to treat brain-related diseases, but it also is an aim in itself, helping us to gain knowledge about how we as humans come to interact with the world. Digital events have a relationship with perceptual mechanisms which, in turn, are related to the brain. Understanding the brain may therefore offer a better understanding of digital events. The reverse may equally be true. In my contribution to the Colloquium I will focus on the ethical issues arising in neuro-ICT. Drawing on my experience as Ethics Director of the EU Flagship Human Brain Project (HBP) I will describe how ethical and social issues are identified and addressed in the project. The HBP is a large-scale international and interdisciplinary project bringing together researchers from more than 120 organisations in more than 20 countries. It has a duration of 10 years (2013–2023) and a core budget of more than €400 million. The HBP has realised from its inception that it will need to deal with ethical and social issues. As a consequence it has incorporated a subproject on Ethics and Society which implements a programme of responsible research and innovation (RRI). This includes activities on technology foresight, philosophical reflection, public engagement and the management of ethical issues. I will outline which ethical issues have been identified and how they are being addressed in the project. It is hoped that this will contribute to both the identification of ethical aspects of digital events and ways to conceptualise and deal with them. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, David Kreps; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,"Abbott, A., Human brain project votes for leadership change (2015) Nature, , https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2015.17060; (2014) Brain 2025, , Bethesda, MD: National Institute of Health; Aicardi, C., Fothergill, B.T., Rainey, S., Stahl, B.C., Harris, E., Accompanying technology development in the human brain project: From foresight to ethics management (2018) Futures, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.005; Alcadipani, R., Hassard, J., Actor-network theory, organizations and critique: Towards a politics of organizing (2010) Organization, 17, pp. 419-435. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1350508410364441; Amunts, K., Ebell, C., Muller, J., Telefont, M., Knoll, A., Lippert, T., The human brain project: Creating a european research infrastructure to decode the human brain (2016) Neuron, 92, pp. 574-581. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.10.046; Dehaene, S., Lau, H., Kouider, S., What is consciousness, and could machines have it?

We examined whether intraoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO 2 ) and neurological dysfunction prior to surgery, measured by robotic technology, are important predictors of post-operative performance following CABG surgery. Methods: Adult patients undergoing CABG surgery were recruited for this single-center prospective observational study. Intraoperative rSO 2 was captured using the FORESIGHT cerebral oximeter. Neurological assessment was performed pre-operatively and 3 months following surgery using robotic technology and a standardized pen-and-paper assessment. Linear regression models were generated to determine the predictive ability of both intraoperative rSO 2 and pre-operative performance on post-operative neurological outcome. Results: Forty patients had complete data available for analysis. Quantified pre-operative performance accounted for a significantly larger amount of variance in post-operative outcome compared to intraoperative rSO 2 . In particular, pre-operative scoring on a cognitive visuospatial task accounted for 82.2% of variance in post-operative performance (b = 0.937, t(37) = 12.98, p = 1.28e−5). Discussion: Our results suggest that pre-operative performance is a stronger indicator of post-operative neurological outcome than intraoperative rSO 2 , and should be included as an important variable when elucidating the relationship between cerebral oxygen levels and post-operative neurological impairment. Rigorous neurological assessment prior to surgery can provide valuable information about each individual patient’s path to recovery. Conclusion: Using robotic technology, quantified neurological impairment prior to CABG surgery may better predict post-operative neurological outcomes, compared to intraoperative rSO 2 values. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cerebral oximetry; Coronary artery bypass surgery; Neurological assessment; Post-operative cognitive dysfunction; Robotic technology",,,,,,"Newman, M.F., Mathew, J.P., Grocott, H.P., Central nervous system injury associated with cardiac surgery (2006) Lancet, 368, pp. 694-703; Pérez-Belmonte, L.M., San Román-Terán, C.M., Jiménez-Navarro, M., Assessment of long-term cognitive impairment after off-pump coronary-artery bypass grafting and related risk factors (2015) J Am Med Dir Assoc [Internet], 16, pp. 263.e9-263.e11; Mahanna, E.P., Blumenthal, J.A., White, W.D., Defining neuropsychological dysfunction after coronary artery bypass grafting (1996) Ann Thorac Surg, 61, pp. 1342-1347; Rudolph, J.L., Schreiber, K.A., Culley, D.J., Measurement of post-operative cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery: a systematic review (2010) Acta Anaesthesiol Scand, 54, pp. 663-677; Lingehall, H.C., Smulter, N.S., Lindahl, E., Preoperative cognitive performance and postoperative delirium are independently associated with future dementia in older people who have undergone cardiac surgery (2017) Crit Care Med, 45, pp. 1295-1303; Bakker, R.C., Osse, R.J., Tulen, J.H.M., Preoperative and operative predictors of delirium after cardiac surgery in elderly patients (2012) Eur J Cardio-thoracic Surg, 41, pp. 544-549; Silbert, B.S., Scott, D.A., Evered, L.A., Preexisting cognitive impairment in patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (2007) Anesth Analg, 104, pp. 1023-1028; Yao, F.-S.F., Tseng, C.-C.A., Ho, C.-Y.A., Cerebral oxygen desaturation is associated with early postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (2004) J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth, 18, pp. 552-558; De Tournay-Jette, E., Dupuis, G., Bherer, L., The relationship between cerebral oxygen saturation changes and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (2011) J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth, 25, pp. 95-104; Murkin, J.M., Adams, S.J., Novick, R.J., Monitoring brain oxygen saturation during coronary bypass surgery: a randomized, prospective study (2007) Anesth Analg, 104, pp. 51-58; Slater, J.P., Guarino, T., Stack, J., Cerebral oxygen desaturation predicts cognitive decline and longer hospital stay after cardiac surgery (2009) Ann Thorac Surg, 87, pp. 36-45; Yu, Y., Zhang, K., Zhang, L., Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for perioperative monitoring of brain oxygenation in children and adults (review) (2018) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 1, p.

For the sake of simplicity, the grid is designed as a single copper plate with island restrictions and constant demand of 1000 MW; the volatile input is deducted from scaled 15-min input data of German grid operators. A mixed integer linear programming model is implemented to generate an optimised unit commitment (UCO) for various scenarios and configurations using CPLEXfi as the problem solver. The resulting unit commitment is input into a non-linear control model (NLC), which tries to match the plan of the UCO as closely as possible. Using the approach of a rolling horizon the result of the NLC is fed back to the interval of the next optimisation run. The problem’s objective is set to minimise CO2 emissions of the whole electricity producer park. Different interval lengths are tested with perfect foresight. The results gained with different interval lengths are compared to each other and to a simple heuristic approach. As non-linear control model a characteristic line model is used. The results show that the influence of the interval length is rather small, which leads to the conclusion that realistic forecast lengths of two days can be used to achieve not only a sufficient quality of solutions, but shorter computational times as well. © 2019 by the authors.","Islands; Long-term storage; MILP models; Mixed integer linear programming; Non-linear control; Renewable energies; Rolling horizon; Unit commitment","Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Heuristic methods; Linear control systems; Speed control; Islands; Long-term storage; MILP model; Mixed integer linear programming; Non linear control; Renewable energies; Rolling horizon; Unit-commitment; Integer programming",,,,,"Framework Convention on Climate Change (2015) Adoption of The Paris Agreement, , United Nations.

Agroecological transition has been promoted as a potential solution to the ecological, social and economic problems generated by these models. It however involves a systemic, multi-scale and transdisciplinary process. Due to this complexity, the overall picture of what farms and food systems “actually are” and “might be” may not be apparent at the individual level. Yet individuals’ knowledge and values provide complementary insights on how to proceed in deepening ecological modernisation. Expertise can also provide landmarks to be considered in that process. Because local stakeholders’ experience and skills are key resources in the adaptation and adoption of agroecological transition, new conceptual and methodological frameworks and tools have to be developed to support them in the design process of such a complex transition. This book presents feedback from the ‘Territorial Agroecological Transition in Action’- TATA-BOX research project, which was devoted to these specific issues. The multidisciplinary and multi-organisation research team steered a four-year action-research process in two territories of France. This book presents: i) the key dimensions to be considered when dealing with agroecological transition: diversity of agriculture models, management of uncertainties, polycentric governance, autonomies, and role of actors’ networks; ii) an operational and original participatory process and associated boundary tools to support local stakeholders in shifting from a shared diagnosis to a shared action plan for transition, and in so doing developing mutual understanding and involvement; iii) an analysis of the main effects of the methodology on research organisation and on stakeholders’ development and application; iv) critical analysis and foresights on the main outcomes of TATA-BOX, provided by external researchers.” © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2019.","Agriculture models; Open access; Participatory process; Territorial redesign; Transition governance; Uncertainties managment",,,,,,,,,,"Springer International Publishing",,,,,,9783030019532; 9783030019525,,,"English","Agroecological Transitions: From Theory to Practice in Local Participatory Design",Book,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064846449

The Integrated Market Allocation-Energy Flow Optimisation Model System (TIMES) was deployed to model the three tested scenarios, namely the business as usual (BAU) scenario, the nuclear (NUC2) scenario in which the 2.00 GW nuclear power is added to the reference energy system, and the renewable plus storage (RNW6S7) scenario that integrated 6 renewable technologies with 7 days of pump hydro storage capacity. An economic assessment on two baseload power plants is included to evaluate the investment viability. The results indicated that the BAU and NUC2 scenario are unsustainable as the dependency on fossil fuel for electrical power generation by 2050 is still high at 71.92% and 66.83% respectively. Contrariwise, the RNW6S7 scenario revealed a low carbon profile for power generation in Malaysia by 2050, whereby the emissions have declined to a minimum level of 11,490 kt which is equivalent to 92.45% of avoided CO2 in contrast to the BAU levels. The low carbon state is attained due to 98.37% of the generation output is renewable electricity. Finally, the RNW6S7 scenario demonstrated that the CO2 emissions in 2030 will drop by 46.22% relative to the 2005 levels which from the power sector perspective surpassed the Paris Agreement targets. © 2019 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Criticism of the dominant, rational approach to project management (PM) and its underlying hypotheses highlights a considerable PM research gap for research projects (research problem). The authors undertake a six-step constructive research approach to investigate if SD (the construct) constitutes a fruitful method to support the management of collaborative research projects. A two-part literature review summarizes known challenges in collaborative research projects and introduces the history and application of SD methodology. The work includes participatory action research (PAR) in two case studies, constituting a qualitative research method. Findings: The authors found the SD method to be useful for structuring and analyzing intuitive project processes. However, using SD in the management of single projects presents some fundamental challenges. SD, like PM, struggles with issues related to myopic decisions, a “predict and provide” attitude with clear aspects of path dependency in the project front-end as well as inconsistent and/or missing identification of success criteria among different stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: This paper does not provide any comprehensive, normative account of scenario techniques or compare SD with other foresight and future studies methods. Although PAR is in itself a research method that demands systematic description and execution, the focus of this paper is the overall constructive research approach. Practical implications: The paper offers a broadened repertoire of methods to describe and analyse project stakeholder situations (collaborative aspects) and to structure and balance the need for both rational and intuitive project processes (research aspects). The SD method also supports development of graphical storylines and facilitates the use of influence diagrams, event trees and cost/benefit analysis. Originality/value: Although PM literature contains several references to SD, the practical application of SD at single-project level has, to the authors’ knowledge, never been described in the PM literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaborative research; Project management; Scenario development",,,,,,"Aaltonen, K., Sivonen, R., Response strategies to stakeholder pressures in global projects (2009) International Journal of Project Management, 27 (2), pp. 131-141; Aarseth, W., Rolstadås, A., Andersen, B., Managing organizational challenges in global projects (2013) International Journal of Managing Projects in Business, 7 (1), pp. 103-132; Adler, N., Elmquist, M., Norrgren, F., The challenge of managing boundary-spanning research activities: experiences from the Swedish context (2009) Research Policy, 38 (7), pp. 1136-1149; Ahlemann, F., Towards a conceptual reference model for project management information systems (2009) International Journal of Project Management, 27 (1), pp. 19-30; Allison, I., Barry, R.G., Goodison, B.E., (2001) Climate and cryosphere (CliC) project science and co-ordination plan: version 1, , Joint Planning Staff for WCRP, World Meteorological Organization; Artto, K., Martinsuo, M., Dietrich, P., Kujala, J., Project strategy: strategy types and their contents in innovation projects (2008) International Journal of Managing Projects in Business, 1, pp. 49-70; Artto, K.A., Artto, K.A., Gemünden, H.G., Gemünden, H.G., Walker, D., Walker, D., Peippo-Lavikka, P., Peippo-Lavikka, P., Is there only one way of project management theorizing, or are there multiple sector-specific project management domains?

Trading networks are interested in expanding the relevant segments of their product range. The purpose of the study is to develop a formula and processing of ice cream with adaptogenic functional properties. Foresight on volumes of the functional products market is formed applying methods of constructing and analyzing dynamic series. Organoleptic evaluation of functional ice cream is carried out by the descriptive method (qualitative) and by the profile analysis method (quantitative). Nutritional value is estimated through the use of physicochemical methods: total protein content-by applying Kjeldahl method; amino acid composition-by ion-exchange chromatography; vitamin content-by high-performance liquid chromatography, fluorescent method; the content of mineral substances-by the method of flame photometry. In order to preserve the nutrient composition of spirulina, the method of sublimation drying is used. The average annual growth of Ukraine functional products domestic market volume is forecasted to amount 5% in the next three years. For the retail chains functional products range expansion, a recipe and technology for the production of milk-based ice-cream (milk) using spirulina (Spirulina Turp.) and extract of stevia leaves, as a sugar substitute, which have a total volume of 6%, is developed. The use of the indicated concentration of components enriches the formulation of ice cream with a full protein in the amount of 7 g per 100 g of product, flavonoids, unsaturated fatty acids, min erals (potassium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, magnesium, silicon, zinc, copper, selenium, chromium, etc.), vitamins C, A, E of B complex. The efficiency of using the sublimation drying method in the functional purpose ice cream production is experimentally proved. A new type of ice cream is a product with high biological value due to the adding of spirulina and stevia plant material into its composition. Developed optimal concentration of additives provides a high nutritional value-digestibility, a mass fraction of nutrients and biologically active substances, organoleptic and physiological value. The estimated cost of ice cream confirms its price competitiveness in the functional products segment. © 2019, Consulting and Training Center - KEY.

The intensity and location of these extractive activities, however, may positively or negatively affect the availability of other benefits that the Canadian and global society receive from the boreal. Where PrES compete, managing these activities along with their impacts to boreal ecosystems becomes a balancing act between the need for resource extraction and the continued availability of the other benefits from ecosystems. Management measures and policies are more likely to succeed if they are designed with foresight, which means accounting for how demand, a key driver of change in the boreal, may change in the future. To help this process, we present three divergent, yet plausible future scenarios based on the analysis of: (i) the capacity of the boreal to provide wood products, fossil fuels, metals and minerals, and hydropower and other renewables; (ii) past trends (1985-2015) and key events in the demand for these PrES; (iii) the interaction of demand for PrES with other drivers of change to the boreal zone; and (iv) the synergies and trade-offs between PrES. We find that historically and currently the capacity of the boreal to provide these PrES exceeds the amount currently supplied. However, the capacity of different PrES and location of extractive activities are spatially dispersed creating a spatial and temporal patchwork of associated risks to local ecosystem integrity and the supply of non-PrES. In addition, these scenarios suggest that the future of boreal PrES is very uncertain and highly dependent on how other drivers of change (namely governance and geopolitics, societal values and climate change) play out in the future. Given the spatial complexity, we find that the cumulative effect of these drivers (e.g., climate change) will determine what paths unfold for different areas of the boreal, and we conclude that careful consideration and planning must be given to ensure that the balance between PrES and non-PrES is maintained. © 2019 Published by NRC Research Press.","Fossil fuels; Mining; Provisioning ecosystem services; Renewable energy; Wood products","Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Fossil fuels; International trade; Mining; Wood fuels; Wood products; Boreal ecosystems; Cumulative effects; Ecosystem services; Global society; Management measures; Renewable energies; Resource extraction; Spatial complexity; Climate change",,,,,"Aarons, K., Vine, D., Canadian hydropower and the clean power plan (2015) Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, , https://www.c2es.org/docUploads/canadian-hydropower-04-2015.pdf, [accessed 4 April 2018]; Alonso, E., Sherman, A.M., Wallington, T.J., Everson, M.P., Field, F.R., Roth, R., Kirchain, R.E., Evaluating rare earth element availability: A case with revolutionary demand from clean technologies (2012) Environ.

Previous studies have shown that impaired intra-operative cerebrovascular autoregulation during cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with delirium. However, postoperative changes in cerebrovascular autoregulation and its association with delirium have not been investigated. One-hundred and eight consecutive adult cardiac surgical patients without baseline cognitive dysfunction or aphasia were included in the study. Cerebrovascular autoregulation was assessed by the Pearson correlation between near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral tissue oxygen saturation and mean arterial pressure to derive the tissue oximetry index. Cerebrovascular autoregulation was monitored for a minimum of 90 min on postoperative day 0 and postoperative day 1. Delirium was assessed throughout intensive care unit admission using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. We observed delirium in 24 of the 108 patients studied. The mean (SD) tissue oximetry index was higher in delirious patients on postoperative day 0 compared with non-delirious patients; 0.270 (0.199) vs. 0.180 (0.142), p = 0.044, but not on postoperative day 1; 0.130 (0.160) vs. 0.150 (0.130), p = 0.543. All patients showed improvement in tissue oximetry index on postoperative day 1 compared with postoperative day 0. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated tissue oximetry index on postoperative day 0 to be independently associated with delirium; odds ratio 1.05 (95%CI 1.01–1.10), p = 0.043. In conclusion, we found an association between impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, and delirium in the early postoperative period. © 2018 Association of Anaesthetists","cardiopulmonary bypass management; cerebral autoregulation; delirium; oximetry","analgesic agent; fentanyl; hypertensive factor; inotropic agent; nitroprusside sodium; propofol; oxygen; adult; aphasia; Article; autoregulation; cerebrovascular disease; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; delirium; female; heart surgery; human; impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; near infrared spectroscopy; observational study; oximetry; postoperative complication; prospective study; surgical patient; tissue oxygenation; adolescent; aged; aphasia; arterial pressure; blood; brain circulation; cardiopulmonary bypass; cognitive defect; confusion; emergence agitation; heart surgery; homeostasis; middle aged; pathophysiology; psychology; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aphasia; Arterial Pressure; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cognition Disorders; Cohort Studies; Confusion; Emergence Delirium; Female; Homeostasis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oximetry; Oxygen; Prospective Studies; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Young Adult",,"fentanyl, 437-38-7; nitroprusside sodium, 14402-89-2, 15078-28-1; propofol, 2078-54-8; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen","FORESIGHT Elite, CAS Medical Systems, United States; IntelliVue MP70 Patient Monitor, Philips Healthcare, Australia","Philips Healthcare, Australia; CAS Medical Systems, United States","(2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5, , Washington, D.C., American Psychiatric Association; Mu, D.L., Wang, D.X., Li, L.H., High serum cortisol level is associated with increased risk of delirium after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a prospective cohort study (2010) Critical Care, 14, p.

The confluence of machine learning advances, accelerated growth in acquired data, on-demand CPU and GPU driven computing such as cloud infrastructure, and other advances in automation and robotics are causing an industrial revolution that some term as the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"". Given that all these transformative technologies are now available and rapidly reinventing other industries, why is the rate of adoption in the oil and gas industry so slow? How can we best utilize these advances to stop drowning in data and instead transform this data into information and knowledge in order to enable secure and intelligent automation in oilfield operations? The oil and gas industry has attempted, at times successfully, a multitude of big data and analytical techniques to further describe and analyze the systems' or system of systems' subsurface interactions. While the proofs of concepts have shown promise, structural difficulties embedded in the design of 20th century systems hinder the implementation of the methods and procedures now part and parcel of the 21st century, driven forth because of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Unfortunately, 20th century procedures are not able to incorporate 21st century driven processes and methods of conducting business. We outline some of the structural challenges facing the oil and gas industry and describe a few of the solutions that have been developed to help companies in the industry. These include applications from the subsurface in geophysics, completions design, and production. Overcoming data silos in traditional data infrastructure requires a novel approach to cloud infrastructure that respects user access, data privacy, and data residency requirements of companies. Assessing data for quality and for reasonable diversity and variation in order to answer questions posed by oil & gas companies can be quite profound. This critical step prevents companies from spending lots of non-productive time and money trying to develop and tune machine learning algorithms to produce answers that are simply not available in the data. Further, getting data to be in a form suitable to apply artificial intelligence can be quite involved. We illustrate the above challenges by several subsurface examples and then describe the implementation of novel solutions. What we will show is that the oil and gas digital highway presently has data traffic jams preventing it from moving at the speed of light. Removing these traffic jams offers decision-makers the Revolution on the previous one while showcasing the concept of [3] Creative Destruction that supplants one technology with another. According to Joseph Schumpeter, the ""gale of creative destruction"" describes the ""process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one"". The various Industrial Revolutions are described in Figure 1 as: 1. IR 1.0 was steam power and the advent of industrialization 2. IR 2.0 was the introduction of factories, mass manufacturing and other techniques of mass production 3. IR 3.0 was the semiconductor revolution with advances in computers, electronics and robotics/ automation 4. IR4.0 is about cyberphysical systems and the marriage of hardware and software to produce autonomous systems [4] The Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in Figure 2 are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. Independent systems have existed and are continuously moving towards becoming autonomous in nature, for example, the above surface rotating equipment in the oilfield whose health is monitored in real-time and event triggers manage and alleviate catastrophic failures. [5] Artificial Intelligence is realizing the intelligent interoperations of system of systems defined as a collection of task-oriented or dedicated systems that pool their resources and capabilities together to create a new, more complex system which offers more functionality and performance than simply the sum of the constituent systems. Upstream oil and gas has specialized over the last 100 years into highly developed scientific and commercial niches. While the outcome has been engineering and academic disciplines driving forth accuracy in decisions within the disciplines, the integration of the various niches, which can be stated as the intelligent communication of information between and among systems, has remained a struggle. We discuss this further under the section entitled ""Data Management"". It is easy to recognize that where there is high quality communication of information among systems, artificial intelligence has made significant strides. For example, facial recognition is now used routinely for expediting in airports for expediting immigration lines, online retail and companies like Netflix use artificial intelligence to understand customer preferences and refine and target their offerings, personal assistants like Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa, Google Now, and Apple Siri use voice recognition for many applications such as home automation. opportunity to move from insight to foresight - looking out in front instead of the rearview mirror to drive change. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Artificial intelligence; Automation; Data privacy; Decision making; Digital storage; Economics; Embedded systems; Face recognition; Gas industry; Gases; Gasoline; Industrial plants; Industry 4.0; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Oil fields; Oil well completion; Public utilities; Real time systems; Robotics; System of systems; Systems engineering; Traffic congestion; Cloud infrastructures; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Hardware and software; Industrial revolutions; Intelligent automation; Intelligent communication; Resources and capabilities; Data communication systems",,,,,"Russell, S.J., Norvig, P., (2016) Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach, , Third Edition, Pearson Education Limited; Schumpeter, J.A., (1942) Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, , London: Routledge; Hetrerogeneous Modelling and Design, , https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/projects/cps/, University of California Berkeley, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cyber-Physical Systems a Concept Map; Popper, S., Bankes, S., Callaway, R., DeLaurentis, D., (2004) System-of-Systems Symposium: Report on a Summer Conversation, , July 21-22, Potomac Institute for Policy Studies; Te Stroet, C., Zwaan, J., De Jager, G., Montijn, R., Schuren, F., Predicting sweet spots in shale plays by DNA fingerprinting and machine learning (2017) Unconventional Resources Technology Conference, , July 24; Tahmasebi, P., Javadpour, F., Sahimi, M., Data mining and machine learning for identifying sweet spots in shale reservoirs (2017) Expert Systems with Applications: An International Journal Archive, 88. , C December; Ghanizadeh, A., Rashidi, B., Clarkson, C., Vahedian, A., Vocke, C.P., Ghanizadeh, A.R., Indirect estimation of fluid transport and rock mechanical properties from elemental compositions: Implications for ""sweet spot;"" identification in the montney formation (Canada) (2017) Unconventional Resources Technology Conference, , July 24; Mckenzie, W., Morandini, F., Verney, P., Deny, L., Rainaud, J.-F., Eastick, R., Mack Endres, D., Integrating WitSML, ProDML, and resQML standards for cross-domain workflows (2012) Society of Petroleum Engineers, , January 1; Weisbin, C.R., Rodriguez, G., NASA robotics research for planetary surface exploration (2000) IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, 7 (4), pp. 25-34. , Dec; Bello, O., Bale, D.S., Yang, L., Yang, D., Kb, A., Lajith, M., Lazarus, S., Integrating downhole temperature sensing datasets and visual analytics for improved gas lift well surveillance (2018) Society of Petroleum Engineers, , September 17",,,,"Society of Petroleum Engineers","Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2018, ADIPEC 2018","12 November 2018 through 15 November 2018",,143431,,9781613996324,,,"English","Soc.
