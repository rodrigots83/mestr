These approaches are necessary, but not sufficient, and past strategies toward formulating roadmaps to high renewables penetration depend on unlikely scenarios. Fuels and electric power are commodities, and most people are satisfied when these commodities are readily available at a reasonable price. History suggests that this situation will likely change only in response to a major crisis such as a climate disaster, an energy shortage driven by growing demand, or a supply interruption caused by war. Obviously there is no firm way to predict a crisis, but drivers can be suggested for many types of crises: global population growth, pollution of all types, resource imbalances, etc. A new approach is needed that builds awareness of knowable drivers to prepare for and capitalize on knowable events, and to build resilience and foresight for responding to unknowable future crises and opportunities. This paper will build on current thinking related to sustainable development, energy forecasting, and complexity theory and show how past roadmapping methodologies fall short. While proposing ways of thinking about our responses to global changes, we consider how we can create and discover the pathways through those unpredictable changes toward high global renewables penetration.",,"Complexity theory; Electric power; Energy forecasting; Energy sector; Energy shortages; Global change; Global population; Growing demand; Market penetration; On currents; Renewable energies; Renewables; Road-maps; Roadmapping; Supply interruption; Sustainable energy; System of systems; Technical systems; Unpredictable changes; Ways of thinking; Climate change; Energy conservation; Sustainable development; Energy policy",,,,,"Snyder, N., A sustainable energy economy: The next challenge for systems engineers (2008) International Council of Systems Engineers Symposium; International Energy Statistics, , US Energy Information Administration, downloaded and adapted 16 February 2012; Delucchi, M., Murphy, J., US military expenditures to protect the use of Persian Gulf oil for motor vehicles (2008) Energy Policy, 36. , Elsevier; (2009) Government Subsidies to Energy Sources: 2002-2008, , Estimating U.S. Environmental Law Institute; (2012) Annual Energy Outlook 2012, , Energy Information Administration; Page, S., (2009) Understanding Complexity, , The Teaching Company; Houle, D., (2007) The Shift Age, , Booksurge; Ramo, J.C., The age of the unthinkable (2009) Back Bay Books; (2011) International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, , 2011 Edition Executive Summary: ITRS; Umpleby, S., (2010) From Complexity to Reflexivity: The Next Step in Systems Science, Cybernetics and Systems ' 10, , Austrian Society for Cybernetic Studies; Lester, R., Hart, D., (2012) Unlocking Energy Innovation, , MIT Press; Soros, G., (2009) Open Society the Financial Crisis, and the Way Ahead, , Open Society Foundation","Snyder, N.; National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, CO 80401, United States; email: neil.snyder@nrel.gov",,,,"World Renewable Energy Forum, WREF 2012, Including World Renewable Energy Congress XII and Colorado Renewable Energy Society (CRES) Annual Conference","13 May 2012 through 17 May 2012","Denver, CO",94564,,9781622760923,,,"English","World Renew.

The methodology applied to develop these scenarios starts from general reflections on what the crisis has brought (and will bring) about, and on the way these changes are perceived and even anticipated by policy makers. These qualitative reflections are used as the basis for what may be called ""quantitative foresights"", built on the discontinuities that will emerge after the crisis. What is called a ""reference scenario"" is built under the assumption that there will be a perception that structural changes will happen, that an extrapolation of past trends has no meaning at all, but that policies will not act in an effective way. This scenario will be compared to a second one, called the pro-active scenario, in which changes will be perceived and even anticipated; and to the reactive or defensive one, based on the assumptions that changes are not fully perceived by economic actors. The structural changes brought about by the crisis are translated into quantitative assumptions for a macro econometric regional growth model created by the authors, called MASST, an acronym recalling its structural features: a macroeconomic, social, sectoral, territorial model, a methodology as neutral as possible which leaves to the model to produce the tendencies and behavioural paths of regional GDP up to 2025. Policy implications are highlighted at the end of the paper.","Regional scenarios; Structural breaks in the economies; World crisis",,,,,,"Armstrong, S.J., (1985) Long Range Forecasting.

To address such co-ordination challenges we specify dimensions of transnational, vertical, horizontal and temporal co-ordination and apply them to three cases of foresight processes in connection with transnational research programming. This provides some evidence on a potentially significant role for foresight in facilitating and integrating different functions of programming but also shows major challenges in foresight design and management, which we address by way of elaborating guiding foresight principles of scalability, modularity and flexibility. We also consider the potential role of foresight in joint programming in Europe and in transnational research programming elsewhere. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

Foresight recommendations are shaped and derived according to the nature and complexity of the themes being considered, the level of stakeholder participation and, quite frequently, the communication skills of those managing the process. Efforts towards better communication among participants are decisive for successful foresight exercises. This paper stresses that the intangibles are important outcomes, as well as the importance of promoting out-of-the-box thinking during the exercise. Lessons learnt are presented, as well as a case study developed by the Center for Strategic Management and Studies (CGEE), Brasília. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

This exercise illustrates how horizon scanning can enable collective sense-making processes which assist in the identification of emerging signals and policy issues; the synthesis of such issues into encompassing clusters; and the interpretation of resulting clusters as an important step towards the coordinated development of joint policy measures. In order to achieve such objectives, horizon scanning can benefit from methods of multi-criteria decision-making and network analysis for prioritizing, clustering and combining issues. Furthermore, these methods provide support for traceability, which in turn contributes to the enhanced transparency and legitimacy of foresight. © The Author 2012.

The agenda-setting, coordination and conduct of science, and the ways in which scientific knowledge is diffused and used, are therefore critical. Increasingly, such issues need to be framed at a global level, reflecting both the international nature of science itself and the scale of the challenges it seeks to address. Longer-term perspectives must also be incorporated to reflect the time horizons of key global challenges and the uncertainties involved in future global governance regimes. Foresight offers a means to explore these dimensions of science. The International Council for Science (ICSU) has been applying foresight as a central component of its strategic planning. This paper describes the most recent ICSU exercise, which has explored how two decades hence international collaboration in science could foster progress in science and address global challenges. © The Author 2012.

This paper presents innovation policy roadmapping (IPRM) as a methodological framework for linking R&D results to systemic policy contexts and to forward-looking policy design. The paper explores the methodological background of the IPRM method and outlines its policy rationale. It also illustrates IPRM with two case studies from Australia and Finland. The case studies reflect on how the policy perspectives can be constructed in a dynamic context of societal drivers, solution and market development, and enabling technologies. The paper concludes by assessing the policy implications of the IPRM approach. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

This paper highlights the contributions that future-oriented technology analysis (FTA) might make to orienting innovation processes towards grand challenges. It takes a 'systems of innovation' approach and focuses on the structural and functional aspects of such systems to consider the relevant roles of FTA. In this context, FTA can generate 'informing', 'structuring' and 'capacity-building' benefits while enabling a shift in innovation foci towards grand challenges. However, FTA could be better exploited to deliver its structuring and capacity-building benefits, which are hardly recognised in the EU's existing innovation policy instruments, in order to effectively reorient the EU's innovation systems towards grand challenges. © The Author 2012.

We discuss how this mission was incorporated into a Fraunhofer corporate programme that takes on global challenges by stimulating collaborative research projects across knowledge domains. Fraunhofer's mission is to conduct innovation-oriented research for the benefit of private and public enterprises as well as society in general. As a decentralised organisation, Fraunhofer's strategic R&D planning predominantly takes place at the level of its 60 institutes and its six groups of institutes, each with similar technological scope. At the corporate level, Fraunhofer complements these strategic planning activities with a process to identify and strategically develop research themes across its institutes. In this paper, we address the question of global challenges, their definition, why and how Fraunhofer can best direct its overarching research topics towards solutions for some of the global challenges. © The Author 2012.

The reasons are manifold relating to the need for an even tighter embedding of FTA in policy-making in a fast-changing complex environment as well as to internal drivers for novel forms of future intelligence to support coordinated and coherent decisions within and across organisations. This paper identifies three ideal types: external FTA services, the institutionalisation of FTA, and FTA networks, whilst recognising that in practice these types are complementary. In empirical terms this requires further investigation, in order to understand how different combinations of activities actually operate in their respective decision-making contexts.

This MSA is based on Substance Flow Analysis. It accounts for the flows of water, nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and energy into, around, and out of the water, energy, food, waste-handling, and forestry sectors of city-watershed systems. Applications of the MSA to two case studies of the Metropolitan Atlanta Area in Georgia, USA, and the Greater London Area, UK, are compared. The impacts and financial benefits are assessed for four candidate technological innovations in the water sector: urine-separating toilets; pyrolysis of sewage sludge; combined food-waste and wastewater conveyance/treatment; and production of algae-based biofuels from sewage. System-wide environmental sustainability is gauged on four accounts, of attaining progressively more ambitious targets of resource savings/recovery in respect of water, energy, and nutrients (both nitrogen- and phosphorus-based). The paper closes by demonstrating how the MSA can provide assistance in framing questions of a more financial and social nature, i.e., those of 'Who reaps the rewards?' and 'Who bears the costs?' of the various prospective technological changes and (possibly) breakthroughs. © IWA Publishing 2012.","Energy; Multi-sectoral analysis; Multi-utility businesses; Nutrients; Technology foresight; Urban metabolism; Water","Atlanta; Energy; Environmental sustainability; Financial benefits; Forestry sector; Georgia; Greater London; Multi-sectoral analysis; Policy intervention; Resource savings; Service business; Substance flow analysis; Sustainable cities; Technological change; Technological innovation; Technology foresight; Wastewater conveyance; Water sector; Phosphorus; Sewage sludge; Systems analysis; Water; Water supply; Nutrients; algae",,,,,"Barles, S., Feeding the city: Food consumption and flow of nitrogen, Paris, 1801-1914 (2007) Science of the Total Environment, 375 (1-3), pp. 48-58. , doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2006.12.003; Barles, S., Urban metabolism and river systems: An historical perspective - Paris and the Seine, 1790-1970 (2007) Hydrology and Earth Systems Sciencesin Discussion, 4 (3), pp. 1845-1878. , doi: 10.5194/hessd-4-1845-2007; Beck, M.B., (2011) Cities As Forces For Good In the Environment: Sustainability In the Water Sector, , http://cfgnet.org/archives/587, Warnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, (ISBN: 978-1-61584-248-4), xx {thorn} 165pp (online as; Beck, M.B., Villarroel Walker, R., Global water crisis: A joined-up view from the city (2011) Surveys and Perspectives Integrating Environment & Society, 4 (1). , http://sapiens.revues.org/1187, Online since 27 December 2011 at; Beck, M.B., Jiang, F., Shi, F., Villarroel Walker, R., Osidele, O.O., Lin, Z., Demir, I., Hall, J.W., Re-engineering cities as forces for good in the environment (2010) Proceedings ICE, Journal of Engineering Sustainability, 163 (1), pp. 31-46; Beck, M.B., Thompson, M., Ney, S., Gyawali, D., Jeffrey, P., On governance for Re-engineering city infrastructure (2011) Proceedings ICE, Journal of Engineering Sustainability, 164 (2), pp. 129-142; Beck, M.B., Villarroel Walker, R., Thompson, M., (2012) Changing the Metabolism of Coupled Human-built-natural Systems, pp. 11-32. , Paper presented at the Earth Systems Engineering 2012:A Technical Symposium on Systems Engineering for Sustainable Adaptation to Global Change, Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research, Newcastle University, UK, pp; Brunner, P.H., Rechberger, H., (2003) Practical Handbook of Material Flow Analysis, , Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, FL; Chen, J., Beck, M.B., Towards designing sustainable urban wastewater infrastructures: A screening analysis (1997) Water Science and Technology, 35 (9), pp. 99-112. , doi: 10.1016/s0273-1223(97)00188-1; Clarens, A.F., Resurreccion, E.P., White, M.A., Colosi, L.M., Environmental life cycle comparison of algae to other bioenergy feedstocks (2010) Environmental Science & Technology, 44 (5), pp. 1813-1819. , doi: 10.1021/es902838n; Dobbs, R., Smit, S., Remes, J., Manyika, J., Roxburgh, C., Restrepo, A., (2011) Urban World: Mapping the Economic Power of Cities, , Report, McKinsey Global Institute; (2002) Water & Sustainability, 3. , EPRI, U.S. Water Consumption for Power Production - The Next Half Century.

However, a lack of conceptual foundation for service science and service innovation is identified. This paper aims at closing this gap, indicating important topics for future research in the field of service innovation. A research portfolio, classifying research questions to be addressed, is developed on the basis of a conceptual framework for service innovation research. The portfolio characterizes research topics and challenges regarding ""rigor and relevance"", thus enhancing the scientific base of service innovation. A three step approach is utilized to generate the portfolio. First, a general service innovation and transformation model is developed. This model is based on general systems theory, following an ITO (input - throughput - output) approach, including a feedback loop as well as environmental aspects. The model outlines relevant aspects for the generation and exploitation of service innovations. Second, related research questions are derived from literature and interviews with experts. The research questions are assigned to corresponding sections of the service innovation transformation model. Third, a wide-spread survey among service researchers is conducted. The survey provides the basis to build the research portfolio, allocating each single research question. Summarizing the findings from the survey and the insights depicted in the research portfolio, specific research challenges to enhance the knowledge base of service innovation are shown. Among other important topics, the results reveal a need for further research regarding strategic foresight, design thinking, technology adaption, and service innovation evaluation. © 2012 IEEE.","Conceptual framework; Service innovation; Service science; Service-dominant logic","Business sector; Conceptual foundations; Conceptual frameworks; Design thinking; Developed countries; Environmental aspects; Feed-back loop; General systems theory; Knowledge base; Research challenges; Research questions; Research topics; Service innovation; Service science; Service sectors; Service-dominant logic; Strategic foresight; Three-step approach; Transformation model; Innovation; Knowledge based systems; Surveys; Research",,,,,"Alam, I., An exploratory investigation of user involvement in new service development (2002) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 30 (3), pp. 250-261; Alam, I., Perry, C., A customer-oriented new service development process (2002) Journal of Services Marketing, 16 (6), pp. 515-534; Behrensdorf, T., (2004) Service Engineering in Versicherungsunternehmen Unter Besonderer Berücksichtigung Eines Vorgehensmodells Zur Unterstützung Durch Informations- Und Kommunikationstechnologien, , Cuvillier Verlag. 1st Edition; Bullinger, H.-J., Fähnrich, K.-P., Meiren, T., Service engineering - methodical development of new service products (2003) Int.

The survey consisted of thirteen projections for the year 2020, ranging from positive statements, such as ""The church will experience a fresh, historic outpouring of the Holy Spirit,"" to negative ones, such as ""There will be an increase of public moral failures among Spirit-empowered leaders."" Of the 132 members invited, 29 percent, or 38 participants completed the survey. Participants reached a consensus on eight of thirteen projections. The results show that Empowered21 leaders have high expectations for 2020 - that the church would experience a historic outpouring of the Holy Spirit, sustained by new leadership.

Foresight is oriented towardwide spread distribution with the aim of the expansion of knowledge and linkages to participation in its forum. It aims to demonstrate best practice in the design and implementation of Foresight methodology and use of quantitative and qualitative methods. This edition covers applications of Foresight at the supra-national, national and regional levels in a wide variety of sectors and thematic areas. It contains overviews of Foresight studies, including the formation of new networks and working communities; it articulates widely-shared and divergent visions. The journal serves as an important outlet forthe dissemination of findings of Foresight exercises to wider social constituents and makes substantial contributions to policy learning and policy transfer processes. In hisinterview with our reporter, Ozcan Saritas talks about the mission and aims of Foresight, the criteria for the selection of papers, the dimension of editorial activities and plans for the future, including prospects of bi-lateral co-operation with Foresight-Russia. He also discusses new challenges for Foresight activities in the context of the changes and developments taking place in the world and the contributions of the systemic approach to long-term forecasting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995459X,,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886455574

In this regard, a timely detection and elimination of problems in Foresight projects is of great importance. A thorough evaluation of criteria and methods used in Foresightanalysis would permit the improved effectiveness of Foresight activities. The resultscould be set against the aims to decide on the feasibility of projects and identify ways to improve them. Despite great interest in Foresight evaluation demonstrated by stakeholders at various levels, the general principles for conducting it have not yet been formulated, which hinders its development and the diffusion of successful expertise. The purpose of this paper is to identify the basic elements - criteria and methods - usedin evaluating national Foresight. It presents the most interesting results for specifictasks, the themes examined, the methods and the findings, in general. In addition, the study allowed some inference about theory and practice of project management. The study reveals that a key motivation for evaluation of Foresight projects is to provide feedbackto national Foresight organizations and identify areas for further development. Evaluation is used to guide Foresight (in varying degrees) and provide lessons learned for future projects (for example, simplifying implementation, involving business and social organizations, recognizing the need for better compliance with the methodology and objectives of the study participants). The paper serves to develop a general methodology for assessing national Foresight programmes. A further agenda is to develop a comprehensiveanalysis of Foresight, ensure comparability of results of Foresight evaluation initiatives in different countries, promote standardization of evaluation procedures.","Best practices; Evaluation; Foresight; Project management",,,,,,"Aichholzer, G., (2001) Delphi Austria: An Example of Tailoring Foresight to the Needs of A Small Country, , Vienna: ITA; Alsan, A., Öner, M.A., Comparison of national foresight studies by integrated foresight management model (2004) Futures, 36 (8), pp. 889-902; Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Bennett, C., Up the hierarchy (1975) Journal of Extension, 13 (2), pp. 7-12; Bezold, C., Lessons from using scenarios for strategic foresight (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1513-1518; Björn, L., Lübeck, L., Swedish technology foresight - A successful project with many lessons learned (2003) Paper Presented at the Second International Conference on Technology Foresight, , 27-28 February, Tokyo; (2002) Futur Lead Visions Complete Document, , BMBF, Berlin: German Ministry for Education and Research; Bohanec, M., Rajkovič, V., Semolič, B., Pogačnik, A., Knowledge-based portfolio analysis for project evaluation (1995) Information & Management, 28 (5), pp. 293-302; Calof, J., Smith, J.E., Critical success factors for government led foresight (2008) Paper Presented at the Third International Seville Seminar on Future Oriented Technology Analysis: Impacts and Implications for Policy and Decision-Making, , Seville, October 16-17; (2009) Multi-Criteria Analysis: A Manual, , CROWN, London: Department of Communities and Local Government; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes - new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22, pp. 93-111; Cuhls, K., Georghiou, L., Evaluating a participative foresight process: Futur - The german research dialogue (2004) Research Evaluation, 13 (3), pp. 143-153; Daim, T., Basoglu, N., Dursun, O., Saritas, O., Pisek, G., A comprehensive review of turkish technology foresight project (2009) Foresight, 11 (1), pp. 21-42; Destatte, P., Evaluation of foresight: How to take long-term impacts into consideration?

It then explores in more depth the specific congruence between action research practices and the principles of integral foresight and futures studies. An approach to understanding expertise in futures and foresight practice consistent with the integral perspective is explored. This draws on the enactive approach to cognition and leads to a model of expertise described as . embodied foresight.

However the impact of such studies on the performance of the national innovation system remains unclear. The paper therefore assesses the impact of national Foresight studies conducted in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Research Area (ERA).The study provides a first indication of the impact of national Foresight studies on the performance of national innovation systems. However the findings so far are preliminary since input data reflect long term developments of national innovation systems. Thus a long term study of the impacts of national Foresight studies is essential. In the short term, it can be concluded that national Foresight studies contribute significantly to the design and in some countries reshape of the innovation system structure and framework conditions. A direct quantitative measurement of the impact and thus the value of Foresight studies cannot yet be done in a statistically reliable fashion. However the changes these studies have caused within the national innovation systems may have an indirect impact on the future national innovation performance. Most recently national Foresight studies have switched from a rather exclusive focus on technology trend assessments towards more integrated holistic approaches identifying future challenges for society and economy as a whole thus deriving strengths and weaknesses of the national scientific, research and technology base to meet these challenges long term in the most appropriate way. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"future prospect; holistic approach; innovation; performance assessment; socioeconomic impact; technological development; trend analysis",,,,,"Zweck, A., Three perspectives for one future in economy and society (2002) Futures Research Quarterly, 18 (1), pp. 22-33; Technology futures analysis: toward integration of the field and new methods (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71, pp. 287-303. , TFAMWG (Technology Futures Analysis Methods Working Group); Gavigan, J., Scapolo, F., Keenan, M., Miles, I., Farhi, F., Lecoq, D., Capriati, M., Di Bartolomeo, T., (2001), FOREN (Foresight for Regional Development Network), A Practical Guide to Regional Foresight, Report; (2002) A Trans-National Analysis of Results and Implications of Industrially-Oriented Technology Foresight Studies (France, Spain, Italy & Portugal), JRC/IPTS-ESTO Study, , J.

The number of FLA studies is globally rising. To some extent, foresight is governed by context-depended issues; however there are also common features in the objectives, methodology, and recommendations made. Mapping allows codifying and analyzing a bulk of FLA experiences gained worldwide. This in turn will contribute to enhancing performance of such activities and therefore of STI policy as a whole. The paper provides rationales for Futures Studies mapping, considers related opportunities and challenges, reviews lessons learned from early mapping efforts. It focuses on the large-scale EU-funded mapping project ""European Foresight Platform"" (EFP). Using this project as illustration, the paper describes mapping routines, the selected indicators of mapped Foresight initiatives, including their objectives, participants, target groups, methodologies, outcomes and recommendations. It discusses the potential and the limitations of particular mapping tools as well as possible applications of gained knowledge. Basing on mapping results, policy-makers, for example, are able to identify gaps to be addressed with relevant policy tools, Mapping also allows Foresight practitioners to develop strategies for further research and shape expert networks for their implementation.","FLA outcomes; FLA players; FLA practices; Foresight; Forward-looking activities (FLA); Mapping; SMART futures",,,,,,"Armstrong, J.S., (2001) Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practitioners, , London: Kluwer Academic Publishers; (2011) ERA Portal Austria, Joint Activities, Grand Challenges, , http://www.era.gv.at/space/11442/directory/11794.html, Austrian Government, (accessed 25 June 2011); Butter, M., Brandes, F., Keenan, M., Popper, R., Evaluating foresight: An introduction to the European foresight monitoring network (2008) Foresight, 10 (6), pp. 3-15; Clarke, A., (1962) Tales of Ten Worlds, , Harcourt Brace; (2010) EFP Online Foresight Guide, , http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/foresightguide/ what-is-foresight, EFP, (accessed 20 July 2011); (2008) Challenging Europe's Research: ERA Rationales for the European Research Area, , ERA EXPERT GROUP, Brussels: European Commission; (2009) Impact Assessment Guidelines, p. 92. , European Commission, SEC (2009), Brussels; (2010) European Forward-Looking Activities: EU Research in Foresight and Forecast, , European Commission, European Commission Directorate-General for Research Communication, Unit B-1049, Brussels; (2011) European Forward-Looking Activities: Building the Future of 'Innovation Union' and ERA, , European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Directorate B - European Research Area, Unit B.5 - Social Sciences and Humanities, EUR 24796, Brussels; (2008) NACE Rev. 2: Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, , Eurostat, Luxembourg: European Communities; Georghiou, L., Cassingena, H.J., (2008) FTA for Research and Innovation Policy and Strategy, , Paper presented at the Third International Seville Seminar on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis ""Impacts and Implications for Policy and Decision-making"", Seville, 16-17 October 2008; Georghiou, L., Cassingena, H.J., Cooke, P., Cozzens, S., Dearing, A., Henriques, L., Langer, J., Popper, R., (2008) Challenging Europe's Research: Rationales for the European Research Area (ERA), , Report of the ERA Expert Group, European Commission, DG Research, EUR 23326, Brussels; Georghiou, L., Keenan, M., Evaluation and impact of foresight (2008) Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, pp. 376-399. , (eds.

We will demonstrate how an appropriate choice of user interfaces, knowledge acquisition tools and analytic decision support methods can stimulate the creativity of the strategic planners taking part in technological roadmapping. With strategic planning formalized as a multicriteria decision problem, the usual process of debating and brainstorming is better focused on reaching a consensus solution in an efficient way. An intelligent roadmapping support tool and publicly available technological foresight results assure a high quality of data gathering and interaction of experts with stakeholders. Real options are used to evaluate the opportunities, threats, challenges, and flexibility during the planning period.

The convergence of a Cournot oligopoly game with nonlinear cost functions is investigated in this paper, where each firm is assumed able to have simple foresight with respect to its rivals' choices in the sense of extrapolative expectations. We eventually arrive at a conclusion that extrapolative expectations act as a stabilizing factor, especially when the foresight is strong enough.

Thermoelectric generators (TEG) were hypothesized for its potential role of battery charger to serve the shining PCED market. Hence, this paper, mainly focusing at the metropolitan market in Thailand, aimed to conduct architectural innovation foresight and to develop scenarios on potential exploitation approach of PCED battery power supply with TEG charger converting power from ambient heat source adjacent to individual's daily life. After technical review and assessment for TEG potential and battery aspect, the business research was conducted to analyze PCED consumer behavior for their PCED utilization pattern, power supply lack problems, and encountering heat sources/sinks in 3 modes: daily life, work, and leisure hobbies. Based on the secondary data analysis from literature and National Statistical Office of Thailand, quantitative analysis was applied using the cluster probability sampling methodology, statistically, with the sample size of 400 at 0.05 level of significance. In addition, the qualitative analysis was conducted to emphasize the rationale of consumer's behavior using in-depth qualitative interview. Scenario planning technique was also used to generate technological and market trend foresight. Innovation field and potential scenario for matching technology with market was proposed in this paper. The ingredient for successful commercialization of battery power supply with TEG charger for PCED market consists of 5 factors as follows: (1) PCED characteristic, (2) potential ambient heat sources/sinks, (3) battery module, (4) power management module, and the final jigsaw (5) characteristic and adequate arrangement of TEG modules. The foresight outcome for the potential innovations represents a case study in the pilot commercialization of TEG technology for some interesting niche markets in metropolitan area of Thailand, and, thus, can be the clue for product development related to TEG for market-driven application in other similar requirement conditions and contexts as well. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","Foresight; Innovation; Portable Consumer Electronic Device (PCED); Portable Power Supply; Thermoelectric Generator (TEG)",,,,,,"Killander, A., Bass, J.C., A stove-top generator for cold areas (1996) Proceedings of the IEEE 15th International Conference on Thermoelectrics, pp. 390-393; Rahman, M., Shuttleworth, R., Thermoelectric power-generation for battery charging (1995) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Energy Management and Power Delivery, 1, pp. 186-191; Talom, H.L., Beyene, A.

Particular attention was devoted to the involvement of foresight, insight, oversight, and hindsight. These four mental acts concern, in divergent ways, the relative degree of ""sightedness"" in Galileo's discovery process and accordingly have implications for evaluating the blind-variation and selective-retention (BVSR) theory of creativity and discovery. Scrutiny of the biographical and historical details indicates that Galileo's mental processes were far less sighted than often depicted in retrospective accounts. Hindsight biases clearly tend to underline his insights and foresights while ignoring his very frequent and substantial oversights. Of special importance was how Galileo was able to create a domain-specific expertise where no such expertise previously existed-in part by exploiting his extensive knowledge and skill in the visual arts. Galileo's success as an astronomer was founded partly and ""blindly"" on his artistic avocations. The investigation closes by briefly discussing Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's similar creation of microscopic biology. This parallel case indicates that Galileo's telescopic astronomy was probably not unique as an illustration of how scientific discovery works in practice. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","BVSR; Discovery; Expertise; Galileo; Hindsight",,,,,,"Amabile, T.M., (1996) Creativity in context: Update to the social psychology of creativity, , Boulder, CO: Westview; (1992), American heritage electronic dictionary (3rd ed.).

Enterprise transformation has special aspects due to the enterprise being a socio-technical system whereupon evolution happens on the levels of individuals / humans / organisation, on the level of the technology and on the level of the Information Systems that integrates the activities performed by humans and by technology. Furthermore, changes are typically continuous, due partly to external factors and partly to strategic foresights. Either way, transformation needs to happen so that the enterprise can keep satisfying its objectives. An important transformation mechanism is to perform mergers or acquisitions (M&As). Interestingly, literature reveals that an unacceptably high percentage of M&As do not achieve the aimed objectives and (as we demonstrate) the success of such trajectory depends on several factors. This article proposes a methodology to overcome potential problems by making necessary anticipatory transformations opening up a possibility to perform M&As with a better chance of success.

The current approach uses aircraft fuel as a primary heat sink which is either cooled by ram air and returned to the aircraft, or rejected off the aircraft when burned by the engine. Traditionally, aircraft have been limited in mission capability by the design performance and the available fuel quantity; however, potential thermal limitations have presented a new mission challenge. Joker and bingo range notifications based on fuel quantity remaining are common on modern fighters to ensure the pilot has the foresight to complete a mission segment and return to base before running out of fuel. Now, pilots may need to consider the possibility of a similar thermal joker/bingo concept until alternative LO heat rejection methods are discovered that remove limitations. Currently, no such parallel advance warning exists for a thermal limitation. As an air vehicle consumes fuel for sustained flight to complete a mission, the amount of thermal mass available for heat rejection, is also consumed. Therefore, an active (pilot in the loop) fuel management capability for range and thermal heat sink is necessary. To enable prediction of remaining thermal capacity requires detailed modeling of the performance of aircraft systems projected over the anticipated remaining mission segments. To this end, a prognostics modeling capability has been created to provide real-time updates to the pilot regarding the state of thermal capacity (similar to fuel quantity and range). The information is relayed to the pilot in the form of a thermal capacity ""gauge"", providing the necessary foresight to allow a pilot to successfully and safely complete a mission segment and return to base. The algorithm is designed to capture deviations from the predefined missions to accurately assess impacts to thermal capacity and provide the pilot with a limitation assessment. In addition, the algorithm has the capability to provide the pilot with optimal thermal cooling operation in the condition where an in-flight thermal limitation is predicted. The foresight provided by this prognostics capability will improve operational performance of the aircraft and provide advanced mission planning ability to avoid thermal limitations in the future. © 2012 SAE International.",,"Design performance; Detailed modeling; Mission capability; Modeling capabilities; Operational performance; Running out of fuels; Tactical aircrafts; Thermal limitations; Algorithms; Design; Fuels; Heat sinks; Systems engineering; Vehicle performance; Aircraft",,,,,"Walters, E., Iden, S., McCarthy, K., Amrhein, M., O'Connell, T., Raczkowski, B., Wells, J., Wampler, B., INVENT Modeling, Simulation, Analysis and Optimization (2010) 48th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting Including the New Horizons Forum and Aerospace Exposition Proceedings, , 4 - 7 January, Orlando, FL; Wu, P., Little, W.A., Measurement of the heat transfer characteristics of a gas flow in fine channel heat exchangers used for microminiature refrigerators (1984) Cryogenics, 24, pp. 415-420; Fischer, A., Design of a Fuel Thermal Management System for Long Range Air Vehicles (2005) 3d Int.

Constraint generation is thus unable to see - and regard - the changed structure of the refactored program, although this new structure may give rise to new constraints that need to be satisfied for the program to maintain its original behaviour. To address this problem, we present a framework allowing the constraint-generation process to foresee all changes a refactoring might perform, generating - at the outset of the refactoring - all constraints necessary to constrain these changes. As we are able to demonstrate, the computational overhead imposed by our framework, although threatening viability in theory, can be reduced to tractable sizes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Changed structures; Computational overheads; Constraint generation; Constraint set; Constraint-based; Refactoring tools; Refactorings; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Object oriented programming",,,,,"Balaban, I., Tip, F., Fuhrer, R., Refactoring support for class library migration (2005) Proc. of OOPSLA, p. 265279; (2010) An Open Source Java Constraint Programming Library, , CHOCO Team choco, Research Report 10-02-INFO, Ecole des Mines de Nantes; Donovan, A., Kiezun, A., Tschantz, M.S., Ernst, M.D., Converting java programs to use generic libraries (2004) Proc. of OOPSLA, p. 1534; Fowler, M., (1999) Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, , Addison-Wesley; Fuhrer, R., Tip, F., Kieun, A., Dolby, J., Keller, M., Efficiently refactoring java applications to use generic libraries (2005) ECOOP 2005.

It focuses on four texts: Adichie's Purple Hibiscus and Half of a Yellow Sun, and Atta's Everything Good Will Come and Swallow. It argues that such characters represent a growing realisation that Nigerian women are less prepared to bemoan gender injustice than to make conscious efforts to improve their own lives. The notion of superwomanhood is discussed, and the various elements that comprise it are described, including the attainment and maintenance of personal autonomy, the ability to reverse the dynamic of patriarchy, and the development of insight and foresight. The paper also argues that female characters in the texts undergo a ""trajectory of becoming"" on their way to attaining the status of superwomen.","Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Contemporary Nigerian fiction; Female characters; Sefi Atta",,,,,,"Adichie, C.N., (2004) Purple Hibiscus, , Lagos, Nigeria: Kachifo Limited; Adichie, C.N., (2006) Half of a Yellow Sun, , Lagos, Nigeria: Farafina; Atta, S., (2005) Everything Good Will Come, , Lagos, Nigeria: Kachifo Limited; Atta, S., (2008) Swallow, , Lagos, Nigeria: Farafina Books; De Beauvoir, S., The second sex (1998) The Theory of Criticism: From Plato to the Present, pp. 533-536. , R.

It was shown that informative equivalents of needs and its satisfaction are reflected in structures of action acceptors in the form of dynamic informative images. On the basis of acceptors of results of action informative systemic quantums are developed which constantly control its manifestation in behavioral systemic quantums. Informative systemic quantums are extracted in advance by predominate motivations and are associated with negative emotions of needs and positive emotions of their satisfaction.

Maintenance is required to maintain a building's initial performance capacity. Without maintenance, performance will not meet the demand and eventually will drop below the limit of acceptance of residents. The tenure has great influence on the attitude towards maintenance. Owner-occupiers' approach towards maintenance is predominantly reactive, a forward planning of maintenance and repair is almost nonexistant. Legislation is a key driver for engaging them with maintenance. For large property owners, national standards set just some minimal requirements. Especially nonprofit landlords maintain and improve their stock in a regularly planned way. Their systematic approach covers a diagnosis, planning, prioritising, and procurement, including selecting maintenance suppliers and control. Technical data collected during a condition survey on-site are the needed input for the maintenance planning of each housing estate. Generally, a condition assessment gives information of the condition of building components expressed in condition marks.

In practice, the storage capacity of certain hardware, e.g. mobile devices and embedded systems, is sometimes insufficient to maintain a large digital map for map-matching. Unfortunately, most existing map-matching approaches consider little about this problem. They only apply to environments with information-rich maps, but turn out to be unacceptable for map-matching on simplified road networks. In this paper, we propose a novel map-matching algorithm called Passby to work on most simplified road networks. The storage size of a digital map in disk or memory can be greatly reduced after the simplification. Even under the most simplified situation, i.e., each road segment only consists of a couple of intersection points and omits any other information of it, the experimental results on real dataset show that our Passby algorithm significantly maintains high matching accuracy. Benefiting from the small size of map, simple index structure and heuristic foresight strategy, Passby improves matching accuracy as well as efficiency. © 2012 ACM.","GPS; map-matching; simplified road network","Data sets; Digital map; Index structure; Intersection points; Map matching; Map-matching algorithm; Road network; Road segments; Storage capacity; Algorithms; Geographic information systems; Global positioning system; Mobile devices; Motor transportation; Image matching",,,,,"(2012) ACM SIGSPATIAL Cup 2012 Training Data Sets, , http://depts.washington.edu/giscup/home, Feb.

Rescue is a critical, but often over-looked, component of nearly all tactical trauma casualty management. Successful full spectrum casualty management requires proficiency in four areas: casualty access, assessment, stabilization, and extraction. When complex rescue situations arise (casualty removal from roof tops, mountain terrain, collapsed structures, wells, or a karez), casualty care often becomes further complicated. Special Operations units have historically looked to civilian technical rescue techniques and equipment to fill this ?rescue gap.? Similar to the evolution of pre-hospital military medicine from civilian guidelines (e.g. Advanced Trauma Life Support) (ATLS)) to an evidence-based, tactical-specific guideline (Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC)), an evolution is required within the rescue paradigm. This shift from civilian-based technical rescue guidelines towards an Operational Rescue? capability allows tactical variables such as minimal equipment, low light/night vision goggles (NVG) considerations, enemy threats, and variable evacuation times to permeate through the individual rescue skill set. Just as with TCCC, in which the principles of casualty care remain consistent, the practices must be adapted to end-users environment, so it is with rescue. 2012.",,"emergency health service; human; injury; military medicine; soldier; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Military Medicine; Military Personnel; Wounds and Injuries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,15539768,,,"23536462","English","J Spec Oper Med",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979856810

Economically, the important parameter is not a physical limit to resources in the ground, but whether market price signals and costs of extraction will indicate the efficiency of extracting conventional or nonconventional resources as opposed to making substitutions over time for other fuels and technologies. We present a hybrid approach to the peak-oil question with two models in which the use of logistic curves for cumulative production are supplemented with data on projected extraction costs and historical rates of capacity increase. While not denying the presence of large quantities of oil in the ground, even with foresight, rates of production of new nonconventional resources are unlikely to be sufficient to make up for declines in availability of conventional oil. Furthermore we show how the logistic-curve approach helps to naturally explain high oil prices even when there are significant quantities of low-cost oil yet to be extracted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Extraction costs; Logistic curves; Peak oil","Capacity increase; Conventional oil; Cumulative production; Extraction costs; Hybrid approach; Logistic curves; Market price; Oil Prices; Peak Oil; Physical limits; World oil production; Extraction; Costs; oil production; oil supply; price dynamics; transaction cost",,,,,"Petroleum Facts and Figures (1959), API, American Petroleum Institute; Bentley, R., Mannan, S., Wheeler, S., Assessing the date of the global oil peak. the need to use 2P reserves (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 6364-6382; Statistical Review of World Energy (2010), BP, Technical Report.

In order to reach a more sustainable development, we analyze the benefits and the constraints of these practices. By comparing various production activities starting from the same initial conditions, we test several strategies and their efficiency faced to different initial conditions and environmental laws. Our study does not compare solely the financial profits of the agricultural activities. But it seeks to better understand and assess the feasibility of new activities in terms of family labor management, availability of land and economic profitability. Our first results conclude that a strict compliance with the law is not economically sustainable if the farmers still apply their standard land use strategies. We hope that this model could become a useful tool for the small farmers. By easily modifying the behavior of an agent, they could virtually invent and assess the efficiency of new practices on their farm. We also hope that this tool could become a means to facilitate dialogue between different stakeholders in the Amazon, in order to achieve more sustainable development. © 2012 IEEE.","Agent Based Model; Amazon; Deforestation; Livestock","Agent-based model; Agricultural activities; Amazon; Economic profitability; Environmental law; Financial profits; Initial conditions; Labor management; Land-use strategies; Landscape dynamics; Livestock; Production activity; Small scale farmers; Computational methods; Deforestation; Land use; Planning; Profitability; Regulatory compliance; Sustainable development; Agriculture",,,,,"Kaimowitz, D., Angelsen, A., (1998) Economic Models of Tropical Deforestation: A Review, , Cifor, 1998; Angelsen, A., Kaimowitz, D., Rethinking the causes of deforestation: Lessons from economic models (1999) World Bank Research Observer, 14 (1), pp. 73-98; Nepstad, D., Mc Grath, D., Alencar, A., Barros, A.C., Carvalho, G., Santilli, M., DCVD, M., Frontier Governance in Amazonia (2002) Science, 295, pp. 629-631. , Science 295: 629-631; Laurance, W.F., Cochrane, M.A., Bergen, S., Fearnside, P., Delamonica, P., Barber, C., Angelo, S., T, F., The future of the Brazilian Amazon (2001) Science, 291 (438-439); Piketty, M.-G., Mudanças do uso da terra e da floresta e efeito estufa nas frentes pioneiras da Amazônia Brasileira (2003) Book Mudanças Do Uso Da Terra e Da Floresta e Efeito Estufa Nas Frentes Pioneiras Da Amazônia Brasileira, , http://agents.cirad.fr/index.php/Marie-Gabrielle+PIKETTY/Publications, Editor (Ed.)∧(Eds.): Univ. de Saõ Paulo; Aguiar, A.P.D., Ometto, J.-P., Nobre, C., Lapola, D.M., Almeida, C., Vieira, I.C., Soares, J.V., Castilla-Rubio, J.C., Modeling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of deforestation-driven carbon emissions: The INPE-EM framework applied to the Brazilian Amazon (2012) Global Change Biology; Deadman, P., Robinson, D., Moran, E., Brondizio, E., Colonist household decisionmaking and land-use change in the Amazon Rainforest: An agent-based simulation (2004) Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 31 (5), pp. 693-709. , DOI 10.1068/b3098; Lambin, E.F., Modelling deforestation processes: A review (1994) Book Modelling Deforestation Processes: A Review, , Editor (Ed.)∧(Eds.): edn; Poccard-Chapuis, R., Thales, M., Venturieri, A., Piketty, M.-G., Mertens, B., Veiga, J.B.D., Tourrand, J.-F., La filière viande: Un levier pour contrôler les dynamiques pionnières en Amazonie brésilienne?

The model is said be non-invertible if there exists no linear rotation of the VAR innovations which can recover the economic shocks. Non-invertibility arises when the observed variables fail to perfectly reveal the state variables of the model. The imperfect observation of the state drives a wedge between the VAR innovations and the deep shocks, potentially invalidating conclusions drawn from structural impulse response analysis in the VAR. The principal contribution of this chapter is to show that non-invertibility should not be thought of as an either/or proposition even when a model has a noninvertibility, the wedge between VAR innovations and economic shocks may be small, and structural VARs may nonetheless perform reliably. As an increasingly popular example, so-called news shocks generate foresight about changes in future fundamentals such as productivity, taxes, or government spending and lead to an unassailable missing state variable problem and hence non-invertible VAR representations. Simulation evidence from a medium scale DSGE model augmented with news shocks about future productivity reveals that structural VAR methods often perform well in practice, in spite of a known noninvertibility. Impulse responses obtained from VARs closely correspond to the theoretical responses from the model, and the estimated VAR responses are successful in discriminating between alternative, nested specifications of the underlying DSGE model.

By the end of 2001, the Army started a program at University of Miami/Ryder Trauma Center, the Navy began a similar program at University of Southern California/Los Angeles County Medical Center, and the Air Force initiated three Centers for the Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills (C-STARS) at busy academic medical centers: R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland (C-STARS Baltimore), Saint Louis University (C-STARS St. Louis), and The University Hospital/University of Cincinnati (C-STARS Cincinnati). Each center focuses on three key areas, didactic training, state-of-the-art simulation and expeditionary equipment training, as well as actual clinical experience in the acute management of trauma patients. Each is integral to delivering lifesaving combat casualty care in theater. Initially, there were growing pains and the struggle to develop an effective curriculum in a short period. With the foresight of each trauma training center director and a dynamic exchange of information with civilian trauma leaders and frontline war fighters, there has been a continuous evolution and improvement of each center's curriculum. Now, it is clear that the longest military conflict in US history and the first of the 21st century has led to numerous innovations in cutting edge trauma training on a comprehensive array of topics.

Machine and human intelligence, including embodiment, are partly shaped by the ebb and flow across Science Fiction and Computer science. Turing's digital concepts and the influence of numerous ideas from Science Fiction films can be better understood firstly via a closer look at the hidden layers and abstractions of digital computers which Turing conceived in 1936. By understanding Turing's binary digits and the convergence of numbers it is possible to see how Turing entertained the notion of digital mimicry of other machines and even humans. The mimicry of human traits since Turing's time is evident in many scientific innovations and abundant in Science Fiction films. Both Science and Science Fiction films perpetuate the idea of 'thinking machines' raised by Turing in a moment of realisation about his binary system for digital computing, that is its flexibility to mimic almost anything. In contemporary time there is as much focus on the integration of intelligence into machines that serve human purposes as there is on activities that aim to distinguish humans from computational machines. Cyborgs, on the other hand, can extend a third hand, arm or ear to improve embodiment, action or art, whilst robots use vision sensors and other sensory systems to mimic human features. Turing was the first to link mimicry of humans using digital machines with cameras and microphones towards the possibility of simulating human senses, an application idea which continued into robotics. These ideas were in addition to his instructions on how digital computers should be set up and run, which later became known as 'computer programming'. The combination of his work and ideas provided the base for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. In the early 21st century the increasing power of microchips, sensor technologies and machine intelligence, echo Turing's notes on storage, speed and methods for programming digital machines. It was the sum of Turing's work that led him to produce the question 'Can Machines think?' and this paper suggests that Turing's question remains a worthwhile conjecture. The question revisited has new contexts at the intersections of digital technology and media, scientific innovation and Science Fiction films. Turing's foresight of mimicry via his digital computing concepts continues in many diverse applications into the 21st Century.",,"Digital machines; Digital technologies; Diverse applications; Human intelligence; Machine intelligence; Science fictions; Sensor technologies; Sensory system; Abstracting; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Digital computers; Robotics; Motion pictures",,,,,"Capek, K., (1920) R.U.R Rossum's Universal Robots, , Prague: Aventinum; Cameron, J., (1991) Terminator 2: Judgement Day [DVD] Tristar Pictures, , USA: Carolco Pictures; Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I., Kelly, K., (2009) New Media: A Critical Introduction, , London: Routledge; Turing, A.M., Computing machinery and intelligence (1950) Mind, p. 437. , Oxford; Deeley, M., Scott, R., (1991) Blade Runner:The Directors Cut [DVD], , USA, Warner Brothers; Turing, A.M., On computable numbers, with and application to the entscheidungsproblem (1937) Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, 2 (1-42), pp. 230-265; Hodges, A., (2002) Alan Turing - A Cambridge Scientific Mind, , http://www.turing.org.uk/publications/cambridge1.html; (2012) IBM Researchers Make 12-atom Magnetic Memory Bit, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16543497; Heyck, H., Embodiment, emotion, and moral experiences: The human and the machine in film (2011) Science Fiction and Computing, Essays on Interlinked Domains, , D.L Ferro & E.G Swedin, Eds., McFarland & Company, North Carolina; Copeland, J., (2004) The Essential Turing, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Kang, M., Sublime Dreams of Living Machines, the Automaton in the European Imagination, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Asimov, I., (2008) I Robot, p. 1950. , New York, Bantam Books; Dick, P.K., Do androids dream of electric sheep (2007) Four Novels of the 1960s, , Library of America, New York; Proyas, A., (2004) I, Robot, [DVD] 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, , USA; (2009) Printing New Skin: Saving Lives with Ink Jet Printers Video Clip, , US Department of Defence, April 3rd 2012; Nofz, M.P., Vendy, P., When computers say it with feeling: Communication and synthetic emotions in kubricks 2001: A space odyssey (2002) Journal of Communication Inquiry, , Sage; (2001) A Space Odyssey, (Kubrick), Length: 142 Minutes, , America, MGM, April 1968; Clarke, A.C., (2001) A Space Odyssey, , Orbit books, 1st Ed.

In addition, information analysis and forecasting about the science and technology are also very critical tasks for researchers, government officers, businessman, etc. Some related studies recently have been executed and semi-automatic tools have been developed actively. Many researchers, annalists, and businessmen also generally use those tools for strategic decision making. However, existing projects and tools are based on subjective opinions from several experts and most of tools simply explain current situations, not forecasting near future trends. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a technology trends analysis and forecasting model based on quantitative analysis and several text mining technologies for effective, systematic, and objective information analysis and forecasting technology trends. Additionally, we execute a comparative evaluation between the suggested model and Gartner's forecasting model for validating the suggested model because the Gartner's model is widely and generally used for information analysis and forecasting. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The Searchlight function consists of a network of forwardlooking, regionally focused horizon scanning and trend monitoring organizations that conduct regular, ongoing scanning for novel ideas, research results, and “clues” as to where the world is evolving. This article aims to focus on the Searchlight function and to introduce the Special Issue. The article describes the goals and evolution of the Searchlight function, an important set of lessons learned, and an overview of the synthesis and visualization efforts that have been applied to the Searchlight outputs. The insights demonstrate that multiple, complementary synthesis and visualization methods can be applied to pull together the findings from a diverse range of horizon scanning activities. These cover a broad spectrum of approaches, ranging from the qualitative to the quantitative, from automated to nonautomated, from local to global, and from topdown to bottomup. They show how different audiences can be reached effectively, from engaging the interested lay public to producing materials for experts in the field. The articles outlined help to advance methodological thinking and provide benchmarks for horizon scanning, trend synthesis, and visualization that the foresight field can learn from and adopt over time. Organizations across a range of sectors face the common challenge of how to monitor the current context in which they operate. While governments and businesses have developed novel ways of generating, processing, and acting on timely information that has longterm relevance and significance, the development and philanthropic sectors have generally been slow to adopt these foresight practices. The Searchlight function is beginning to fill this gap in the social sector. The Searchlight function demonstrates how the practice of anticipating and tracking trends and envisioning different alternatives for how global issues might evolve can be harnessed to shape the future of human development and to improve the lives of poor and vulnerable populations. Creating such a global endeavor on this scale requires an iterative process linking together talented and committed individuals and institutions dedicated to a common goal. The Searchlight function demonstrates one way that the philanthropic and broader social sector can take steps to think and act with the longterm future more explicitly in mind by anticipating the most challenging problems and opportunities that might impact the lives of poor or vulnerable populations over the longterm future. It shows how an organization can use trend monitoring and horizon scanning to better understand how the dynamic issues facing poor and vulnerable populations intertwine to create the complex realities of today and how they might fit together to illuminate the new realities of tomorrow. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Globalization; Horizon scanning; Philanthropy; Searchlight function; Society; Strategic planning; Trends; Visualization",,,,,,"Bezold, C., Bettles, C., Juech, C., Michelson, E., Peck, J., Wilkins, K., (2009) Foresight for Smart Globalization: Accelerating and Enhancing Pro-poor Development Opportunities, , Institute for Alternative Futures and the Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY; Meadows, D., (1999) Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System, , The Sustainability Institute, Hartland, VT; (2010) Building a Searchlight Function: Workshop Report and Participant Reflections, , Society for International Development and the Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY; (2011) Searchlight Convening: The Future of the Urban Poor, Report and Participant Reflections, , Intellecap and the Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY",,,,,,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869431940

We outline the methodologies that have largely been developed in the last five years to assess this capacity in young children and non-human animals. Drawing on Tulving's definition of episodic and semantic memory, we provide a critical analysis of the role that both types of memory might have on the episodic foresight tasks described in the literature. We conclude by highlighting some unanswered questions and suggesting future directions for research that could further our understanding of how memory is intimately connected to episodic foresight. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Episodic foresight; Episodic memory; Human animals; Non-human animals",,,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Anderson, R.J., Dewhurst, S.A., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Differences in event specificity of spontaneously generated thought (2009) Memory, 17, pp. 367-373; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5, pp. 533-539; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., The emergence of episodic future thinking in humans (2005) Learning & Motivation, 36, pp. 126-144; Barsalou, L.W., The content and organization of autobiographical memories (1988) Remembering reconsidered: Ecological and traditional approaches to the study of memory, pp. 193-243. , Cambridge University Press, New York, U.

However, major national foresight programmes that have a 4-5. year cycle have encountered many challenges. These challenges include prolonged planning time, resulting in not keeping pace with the ever-changing environment, massive resource investment unsuitable for countries with limited resources, and bottlenecks such as inoperability of the planning processes connected to follow-up project promotion. In this article, we propose a dynamic modular design perspective to overcome such difficulties and demonstrate the process and achievements of foresight planning using the Taiwan Industry and Advanced Technology Research Project as an example. Our research results can serve as a reference in national technology foresight planning for developing countries with limited resources in the rapidly changing technology development environment. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptive planning; Dynamic planning; Modular design; Taiwan; Technology foresight","Advanced technology; Dynamic adjustment mechanism; Dynamic planning; Environmental challenges; Modular designs; National development; Operational model; Planning process; Planning time; Research results; Taiwan; Technology development; Technology foresight; Developing countries; Investments; Research; Design; adaptive management; developing world; management practice; modeling; planning process; planning system; research and development; technological change; technological development; Taiwan",,,,,"Konnola, T., Scapolo, F., Desruelle, P., Mu, R., Foresight tackling societal challenges: impacts and implications on policy-making (2011) Futures, 41, pp. 252-264; Saritas, O., Oner, M.A., Systemic analysis of UK foresight results: joint application of integrated management model and roadmapping (2003) Technol.

Foresight approaches in Science & Technology policy have been implemented by many countries to search the developing opportunities and uncertainty in the future. This is one response to the policy priority-setting and resources allocated. Taiwan has well foundation to develop the solar energy industry, the government also regard it as the main promotion emerging energy. However, foresight researches on the solar energy industry are insufficient. Hence, this study is aims to find out what the solar energy industry will be in the future. Q methodology often used to explore the multidimensional viewpoint issues, which is helpful for the interviewees to point out the real point of view on the research subject. This study makes sense of the types of solar energy industry policy foresight by using Q method that is combination of questionnaires, interview, and statistic analysis. Furthermore, for forming the Q statements, this study adopt Delphi method as a tool to be authorized by the subjects within expertise, and subsequently stakeholders' perceptive types of Policy Foresight will be sorted out. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Delphi method; Energy industry; Q method; Research subjects; Statistic analysis; Technology policy; Decision making; Industrial management; Research; Surveys; Technology; Industry",,,,,"Miles, I., The development of technology foresight: A review (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77, pp. 1448-1456; Irvine, J., Martin, B.R., (1984) Foresight in Science: Picking the Winners, , London: F.

Science parks have been crucial elements of innovation systems both in developed and developing countries because their role in bridging the gap between academia and business through knowledge spill-overs and spin-offs. Although there is a widespread consensus about the usefulness of the science park concept, the actual performance of science parks and how well they meet expectations have been controversial. This paper discusses the success factors for science parks. A three-dimensional policy framework, which includes 'complementarity', 'networking' and 'strategic scalar positioning' is suggested to be taken into account during the design and operation of science parks. The paper describes the Foresight process and the policies and strategies developed by using the three-dimensional policy framework proposed for the newly established science park at Ankara University. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Ankara University; complementarity; Foresight; networking; policy; science park; strategic scalar positioning; strategy","academic research; developing world; high technology industry; innovation; networking; science and technology; strategic approach; technological development; technology policy; university sector; Ankara [Turkey]; Turkey",,,,,"Amable, B., Petit, P., (2001) The diversity of social systems of innovation and production during the1990's, , Working paper, CEPREMAP 2001/15, Paris; Arslan, A., Gümüştekin, G.E., Educational backgrounds of contemporary Turkish elites (2004) International Journal of Human Sciences, 1, pp. 1-21; Avnimelech, G., Teubal, M., The emergence of Israel's venture capital industry: How policy can influence high-tech cluster dynamics (2006) Cluster genesis, pp. 172-193. , In: Braunerhjelm P., Feldman M., editors Oxford: Oxford University Press; BAP. 2009.

We show that the public provision of health investments and the existence of a private system of old-age insurance (i. e., transfers from children to parents) may cause the birth and death of multiple (three) steady states, deterministic chaos and bubbling phenomena when individuals have perfect foresight. Interestingly, however, we show that periodic dynamics (cycles) or complex dynamics (chaos) and global stability of the economy can endogenously be reconciled in the model, because the rise either in public health investments or transfers from young to old people can have the potential to smooth and ultimately suppress endogenous fluctuations in the cases of existence of both a single steady state or multiple steady states. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Chaos; Endogenous fertility and longevity; OLG model; Perfect foresight; Private old-age support; Public expenditure on health",,,,,,"Abel, A.B., Precautionary saving and accidental bequests (1985) American Economic Review, 75, pp. 777-791; Antoci, A., Sodini, M., Indeterminacy, bifurcations and chaos in an overlapping generations model with negative environmental externalities (2009) Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 42, pp. 1439-1450; Azariadis, C., Drazen, A., Endogenous fertility in models of growth (1993) Revista De Analisis Economico, 8, pp. 131-144; Barro, R.J., Are government bonds net wealth?

Design/methodology/approach: The essay combines a general review of the topic with an overview of a range of horizon-scanning approaches that are in use in the UK health system. Findings: Different approaches - shorter as well as longer-term, searching as well as broad scanning - are appropriate in different circumstances. In times of systemic change it is necessary to combine approaches of all types. Research limitations/implications: Only a small sample of the huge range of horizon-scanning exercises has been studied, and the essay has not gone far into the question of how horizon-scanning relates to other elements of the foresight process. Practical implications: The implication is that horizon-scanning should be undertaken on a routine basis, and should be integrated into planning activities from the start. Social implications: Horizon-scanning is a tool needed in activities such as planning for the workforce, and for health and safety issues. Originality/value: The essay covers a wide range of activities with real-life illustrations in addition to overall assessment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forecasting; Forward planning; Health services sector; Human capital; Plans; Strategic planning",,,,,,"News Review: Searching for 'black swans' (2010) Bermuda Insurance Quarterly, , www.pwc.com/bm/en/publication/assets/BIQJan2010.pdf, January, available at, (accessed 23 July 2012); Calof, J., Smith, J., The integrative domain of foresight and competitive intelligence and its impact on R&D management"" R&D Management (2010) R&D Management, 40 (1), pp. 31-39; (2001) A health service of all the talents: Developing the NHS workforce - consultation document on the review of workforce planning, , www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4003182, Department of Health, available at; Fiet, J., A prescriptive analysis of search and discovery (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44 (4), pp. pp592-pp611; Godet, M., (1985) Crises Are Opportunities, , Gamma Institute Press, Montreal; (2008) Foresight Annual Review 2008, , www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/publications/annual-reviews, Government Office for Science, available at, (accessed 4 July 2012); (2011) Sharing Experience: Improving engagement across SAC Secretariats, , www.bis.gov.uk/assets/goscience/docs/s/10-1012-sharing-experience-across-sac-secretariats.pdf, Government Office for Science, available at, (accessed 12 August 2012); Habegger, B., Strategic foresight in public policy: Reviewing the experiences of the UK, Singapore, and The Netherlands (2010) Futures, 42 (1), pp. 49-58; Haggard, H.R., (1951) She, , (first published 1887), Dover Publications, New York, NY; Harzing, A.W., (2007), www.harzing.com/pop, Publish or Perish, available from; Workforce Planning Fourth Report of 2006-7 (2007), www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmhealth/171/171i.pdf, Health Committee, available at; (2011) Science Report 2011, , www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/meetings/hseboard/2011/6011/pjanb1104.pdf, Health and Safety Executive, available at, (accessed 5 July 2012); Imison, C., Buchan, J., Xavier, S., (2009) NHS Workforce Planning: Limitations and Possibilities, , King's Fund, London; Katz, J.S., Stewart, S., Gow, T.A.K., Martin, B., (2001) Science Foresight Project: Final Report., 1. , www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/foresight/index.shtml, DSTL Technical Report DSTL/TR01697, available at, (accessed 5 July 2012); Martin, A.E., Mortality and morbidity statistics and air pollution (1964) Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, 57, pp. 969-975; Miles, I., UK foresight: Three cycles on a highway (2005) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 2 (1), pp. 1-34; Popper, R., Keenan, M., Miles, I., Butter, M., Sainz de la Fuenta, G., Global Foresight Outlook 2007 (2007) EFMN Network, , www.foresight-network.eu/files/reports/efmn_mapping_2007.pdf, available at, (accessed 4 July 2012); van der Heijden, K., (1996) The Art of Strategic Conversation, , Wiley, Chichester; van Rij, V., Joint horizon scanning: Identifying common strategic choices and questions for knowledge (2010) Science and Public Policy, 37 (1), pp. 7-18","Miles, I.; Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; email: Miles@mbs.ac.uk",,,,,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869432313

This paper seeks to focus on this broad-based approach. Design/methodology/approach: Starting from the top-down horizon scan of the foundation's Searchlight partners - a network of horizon scanning organizations - IFTF created a public database of signals of innovation and disruption in the domain of poverty and social change. This signals database was used to build a visual map of catalysts for change, creating a simple hierarchy of four catalyst types, each containing four action zones and a pivotal challenge. This map provided the language and framework for engaging a global community in a serious game to extend the vision of the Searchlight function and capture novel ideas for innovations that could improve the lives of those in marginalized communities. Findings: With an estimated global reach of 160,000 views and 1,600 game players from 79 countries, the game produced more than 18,000 ideas about catalysts for change. Originality/value: This framework of foresight (the signals database) to insight (the visual map of catalysts for change) to action (global strategic game) demonstrates a way to integrate top-down expert foresight with bottom-up strategic ideation on a global scale. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communities; Crowd-sourcing; Disadvantaged groups; Engaged forecasting; Mapping; Poverty; Searchlight function; Signal; Strategic planning; Visualization",,,,,,"Meadows, D., Leverage points: Places to intervene in a system (1999), The Sustainability Institute, Hartland, VT","Vian, K.; Institute for the Future, Palo Alto, CA, United States; email: kvian@iftf.org",,,,,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869466122

Design/methodology/approach: Built upon the concept of the systemic foresight methodology, the Scan-4-Light approach involves the integrated use of horizon scanning, network analysis and evolutionary scenarios combined with expert consultations and workshops. The study identified the emerging trends, issues, weak signals and wild cards; created high-value visualisations to emphasize the results and findings; and produced narratives to increase the impact and awareness of the development issues. Findings: The Scan-4-Light project has resulted in a large number of specific outputs, providing the views of the Searchlight newsletters' contents at various levels of granularity. It has set out to show how the tools used here can be applied to illustrate the relationships among issues, and how these vary across countries and regions over time, and are linked to various stakeholders and possible solutions to problems. Research limitations/implications: Scan-4-Light demonstrates how foresight tools and techniques can be used for the analysis of complex and uncertain issues, such as development and poverty, in a systemic way. Practical implications: The Scan-4-Light approach can be applied in a number of areas for scanning and identifying emerging trends and issues, and understanding the relationships between systems and solutions. Social implications: The paper gives evidence that most of the issues, if not all, related to development are not isolated, but interlinked and interconnected. They require more holistic understanding and intervention with an effective collaboration between stakeholders.

It serves as the primary means by which Americans get their political information. Likewise, it develops their sense of how politics and politicians operate in our democracy. This paper examines how enhanced television technologies might be applied to political programming, as well as the effects such changes might have on the future of participatory democracy. Following a series of conjectures regarding the future application of enhanced television technologies to politics, the potential benefits and drawbacks of interactive television on governance are discussed. Using the social shaping approach to technology foresight, it is demonstrated that forecasts of technology and governance are ultimately dependent upon the normative assumptions of the investigator. © 2012.",,"democracy; future prospect; governance approach; information technology; political participation; television; United States",,,,,"Constantakis-Valdez, P., Interactive Television Museum of Broadcast Television, , http://www.museum.tv/; Jørgensen, M., The social shaping approach to technology foresight (2009) Futures, 41, p. 81; Blumler, J., Katz, E., (1974) The Uses of Mass Communications: Current Perspectives on Gratifications Research, , Sage, Beverly Hills; OEDN is to Interactive Television what HTML is to the Internet - A Programming Language. ; http://cms.bsu.edu/Features/Global/ImmersiveLearning/TuneInTomorrow.aspx, Tune in Tomorrow: C-SPAN Partnership Pursues Model for Future Interactivity; Montouri, A., Beyond postnormal times: the future of creativity and the creativity of the future (2010) Futures, 43, pp. 221-227; Smart, J., Tomorrow's interactive television (2010) The Futurist, pp. 41-46. , November-December; Jørgensen, M., The social shaping approach to technology foresight (2009) Futures, 41, p. 82; Jørgensen, M., The social shaping approach to technology foresight (2009) Futures, 41, p. 84; Grantham, A., Tsekouras, G., Information society wiresless ICT's transformative potential (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 359-377; Almond, G., Verba, S., (1963) The Civic Culture, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Woolcock, M., The rise and routinization of social capital, 1988-2008 (2010) Annual Review of Political Science, 13, pp. 469-487; Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies, , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick; Sardar, Z., Welcome to postnormal times (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 435-444","Waite, B.C.; Political Science and Emerging Media Faculty, Ball State University, 2000 University Ave., North Quad 269, Muncie, IN 47306-0002, United States; email: bcwaite@bsu.edu",,,,,,,,00163287,,,,"English","Futures",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867991335

This contradicts the basic principle of criminal responsibility that criminalisation is based upon moral blameworthiness. A conviction for murder requires at least a conscious appreciation of a real risk of death. Recent research by developmental neuroscientists shows that adolescence is a developmental stage and that the adolescent brain is not capable of the same level of reasoning expected in the average adult. This article suggests that the criminal justice system can adapt to these recent advances in knowledge via specific defences of a diminished capacity class, or by allowing evidence of general adolescent brain development to support defence arguments that a young accused did not form the mens rea required for murder. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adolescence; brain development; cognition; diminished capacity; foresight; homicide; juvenile justice; murder; neuroscience; recklessness",,,,,,"Soler, M., Shoenberg, D., Schindler, M., Juvenile Justice: Lessons for a New Era (2009) Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy, 16, pp. 483+492; Micucci, L., Responsibility and the Young Person (1998) Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence, 11, pp. 277+278; Bronitt, S., McSherry, B., (2001) Principles of Criminal Law, p. 147. , note; Simester, A., Brookbanks, W., (2007) Principles of Criminal Law, p. 8. , note; Micucci, L., Responsibility and the Young Person (1998) Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence, 11, pp. 277+278; Doob, A.N., Tonry, M., Varieties of Youth Justice (2004) Crime and Justice, 31, pp. 1+3; Becroft, A., Youth Justice-TheNew Zealand Experience: Past Lessons and Future Challenges (2003) Australian Institute of Criminology/ NSW Department of Juvenile Justice Conference, , note; Doob, A.N., Tonry, M., Varieties of Youth Justice (2004) Crime and Justice, 31, pp. 1+3; Doob, A.N., Tonry, M., Varieties of Youth Justice (2004) Crime and Justice, 31, pp. 1+3; Doob, A.N., Tonry, M., Varieties of Youth Justice (2004) Crime and Justice, 31, pp. 1+3; Micucci, L., Responsibility and the Young Person (1998) Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence, 11, pp. 277+278; Ball, C., Youth Justice?

This process of cumulative cultural evolution underlies human cultural success and has enabled us to reach and inhabit some of the most inhospitable environments on this planet. Why humans, but not other animals, have exhibited a cultural explosion has caused much deliberation. The human propensity to imitate, teach, ""mind-read"" and cooperate have all featured prominently in accounts of the prerequisites for cumulative culture. However, this may not represent the complete picture. In this article we consider whether there exists a link between future thinking, specifically prospective mental time travel, and the observed distribution of cumulative culture. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Cumulative culture; Episodic foresight; Future thinking; Mental time travel; Ratcheting; Social learning",,,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Ambrose, S.H., Paleolithic technology and human evolution (2001) Science, 291, pp. 1748-1753; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., The development of episodic future thinking (2005) Learning and Motivation, 26, pp. 126-144; Bartlett, F.C., (1932) Remembering, , Macmillan, Oxford; Beran, M.J., Summation and numerousness judgments of sequentially presented sets of items by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (2001) Journal of Experimental Psychology, 115, pp. 181-191; Biro, D., Inoue-Nakamura, N., Tonooka, R., Yamakoshi, G., Sousa, C., Matsuzawa, T., Cultural innovation and transmission of tool use in wild chimpanzees: Evidence from field experiments (2003) Animal Cognition, 6, pp. 213-223; Boesch, C., Is culture a golden barrier between human and chimpanzee?

In this paper, we argue that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) offers an ideal test of such theories, given that it is a developmental disorder that is characterized by impairments in episodic memory. Each of these theories would predict concomitant impairments in episodic future thinking among individuals with ASD. We review evidence concerning episodic future thinking in ASD, as well as studies of prospective memory (remembering to do something in the future), planning, navigation, and theory of mind, which some theories suggest also rely on the same mechanism as episodic future thinking. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Autism spectrum disorder; Episodic future thinking; Episodic memory; Mental time travel; Planning; Prospective memory",,,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Adler, N., Nadler, B., Eviatar, Z., Shamay-Tsoory, S.G., The relationship between theory of mind and autobiographical memory in high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome (2010) Psychiatry Research, 178, pp. 214-216; Altgassen, M., Schmitz-Hübsch, M., Kliegel, M., Event-based prospective memory performance in autism spectrum disorder (2010) Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders, 2, pp. 2-8; Altgassen, M., Williams, T.I., Bölte, S., Kliegel, M., Time-based prospective memory performance in children with autism spectrum disorders (2009) Brain Impairment, 10, pp. 52-58; (2000), American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).

This paper begins by tracing how models of cognition and human nature formed the foundational design logic (and perceived design constraints) for almost all of the "" constituted"" political entities of the last two and half centuries. It then looks at how advances in the brain sciences have expanded, and in many cases overturned, common beliefs about how the brain works and notions about "" human nature."" These include the re-imagining of the bounded, independent individual, the place of rationality and emotion in decision-making, and new understandings of human capacities (and incapacities) for foresight. Next, it analyses the new responsibilities and dilemmas generated by an emerging neuropolitics. Finally, it lays out four alternative futures for governance, with emphasis on the ways agents of power might respond to these changes and how basic political structures of government could evolve within several possible neurocentric worlds. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"brain; cognition; decision making; governance approach; government",,,,,"Zimmer, C., (2004) Soul Made Flesh: The Discovery of the Brain-And How It Changed the World, , Free Press, New York; Reichman, W., Cognition & neuroplasticity: the new health & wellness frontier (2010), Presented at SharpBrains Virtual Summit, January, 2010; Olson, G., (2008) We Empathize, Therefore We Are: Toward a Moral Neuropolitics, , http://www.zcommunications.org/we-empathize-therefore-we-are-toward-a-moral-neuropolitics-by-gary-olson, ZNet, (retrieved 01.10.11); Connolly, W., (2002) Neuropolitics: Thinking, Culture Speed, p. 57. , University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis/London; Searle, J., (2007) Freedom and Neurobiology: Reflections on Free Will, Language and Political Power, p. 95. , Columbia University Press, New York/Chichester, West Sussex; Warren, C., (1928) The Making of the Constitution, , Little Brown, Boston; Rakove, J.N., (1996) Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution, , Alfred A.

The region, while not part of Europe's high development ""Blue Banana,"" is nonetheless increasingly becoming a high technology, research intensive cluster in Europe. The region, for instance, is increasingly becoming a leading area for academic research into nanotechnology and nanoscience. The technology concentration of the region may presage future economic advancement. The paper carefully characterizes the region using geographical queries. This paper further characterizes the region using science and technology indicators. We contrast the region with the international science base, in order to sharply delineate regional sources of specialization. We identify and discuss the leading innovation actors. We use both input indicators, as well as output indicators, such as science and patent statistics. We adopt an innovation systems perspective, culminating in a critique of the perspective as well as recommendations and foresight for the region. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Academic research; Barcelona; Economic advancements; High technology; Industrial districts; Innovation system; International science; Northern Italy; Patent statistics; Regional innovation systems; Science and technology indicators; Valencia; Arches; Industrial management; Nanoscience; Patents and inventions; Regional planning; Technology",,,,,"Asheim, B.T., Differentiated knowledge bases and varieties of regional innovation systems (2007) Innovation, 20 (3), pp. 223-241; Asheim, B.T., Smith, H.L., Oughton, C., Regional innovation systems: Theory, empirics and policy (2011) Regional Studies, 45 (7), pp. 875-891; Baptista, R., Swann, P., Do firms in clusters innovate more?

As an initial part of this paper we propose two studies: 1) trends analysis and 2) change drivers' identification; these lets us know exactly what are the relevant trends in areas where we want to venture that may affect the business activities. All this information is put into a Delphi process with the help of experts in order to find the common denominator of where the future is going; afterwards, with this information we can build events and scenarios for the business opportunities. Then, a diagnostic of the study area, sector or organization through the dynamic diagnostic methods is performed. Once the opportunities have been identified, a strategic analysis that allows decision making to prioritize and define the activities or projects that may be achievable in the future is done, and the result of the process is a portfolio of in business opportunities projects fully defined and ready to be planned with a roadmap where the complete path is drawn. The process allows the managers to consistently organize their development processes targeted to real business opportunities. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Business activities; Business opportunities; Common denominators; Development process; Dynamic diagnostics; Roadmap; Strategic analysis; Study areas; Support tool; Industrial management; Managers; Technology",,,,,"Vecchiato, R., Roveda, C., Strategic foresight in corporate organizations: Handling the effect and response uncertainty of technology and social drivers of change (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1527-1539; Jeong, N.-Y., Park, J.-S., Heo, T.-Y., Conceptual designs for trend analysis system: A tool for corporate foresight Proc., Advanced Communication Technology, the 9th International Conference on, pp. 340-344; Pillkahn, U., (2008) Using Trends and Scenarios As Tools for Strategy Development : Shaping the Future of Your Enterprise, , Publicis Corporate Publishing, Berlin; Güemes-Castorena, D., Megatrend methodology to identify development opportunities Proc., PICMET 2009 Proceedings, p. 6; De Miranda Santo, M., Coelho, G.M., Dos Santos, D.M., Filho, L.F., Text mining as a valuable tool in foresight exercises: A study on nanotechnology (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73 (8), pp. 1013-1027. , DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2006.05.020, PII S004016250600117X, Tech Mining: Exploiting Science and Technology Information Resources; Nehme, C.C., Galvao, A., Vaz, A., Coelho, G., Fellows, L., A foresight method for enhancing competitiveness of Brazilian industrial sectors (2009) Innovation and Creativity in A Complex World, pp. 115-131; Malanowski, N., Zweck, A., Bridging the gap between foresight and market research: Integrating methods to assess the economic potential of nanotechnology (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74 (9), pp. 1805-1822. , DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2007.05.010, PII S0040162507001308, Three Special Sections: Assessment of China's and India's Science and Technology Literature Nanotechnology Policy Minding the Gap: Previewing the Potential of Breajthrough Technnologies; Fenwick, D., Daim, T.U., Gerdsri, N., Value Driven Technology Road Mapping (VTRM) process integrating decision making and marketing tools: Case of Internet security technologies (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76 (8), pp. 1055-1077; Rohrbeck, R., Thom, N., Strategic foresight at deutsche telekom AG Proc., Management of Innovation and Technology, 2008.

A systems approach was developed for a VELO and is presented in this paper. The VELO has to perform these three basic entrepreneurial tasks in interaction with a dynamic and complex global business environment. This requires exploring the future, predicting technology developments and preparing for the unknown. Developing visions of the future and linking the foresight to entrepreneurial decision-making is a big challenge in today's global economy. Global sustainable development is a widely accepted vision in today's world. Despite of the practical problems, this vision gives future direction for emerging technologies and changes in social, economic and ecological dimensions. The view on the global challenge of a sustainable development shows enterprises' opportunities to achieve and sustain vitality at the company-level: The VELO can contribute to a global sustainable development via innovation in new and established businesses to maintain their own competitiveness, reputation and economic substance. The paper describes global and company-level perspectives on sustainability and business opportunities as well as the interaction between the VELO and the global business environment. The research method is exploratory using literature data and Vester's sensitivity analysis methodology to present a set of variables and an influence matrix to describe the networking between the VELO and its environment as a total system. © 2012 PICMET (Portland Intl conf on Manage.",,"Business environments; Business opportunities; Emerging technologies; Global business; Global economies; Influence matrix; Literature data; Practical problems; research methods; Systems approach; Technology development; Competition; Digital storage; Industrial management; Industry; Planning; Technology; Sustainable development",,,,,"Abell, D.F., (1993) Managing with Dual Strategies: Mastering the Present, Preempting the Future, , The Free Press: New York; Al-Laham, A., Strategische aspekte von nachhaltigkeit am beispiel des managements von unternehmensnetzwerken (2008) Nachhaltiges Wirtschaften, , Eds.

Among the three pillars of sustainability consisting of environmental, social and economic longevity and foresight of a firm, we focus on the environmental component. Specifically, basing our arguments on the resource-based view of the firm, we hypothesize the impact of environmental management on plant performance. Environmental initiatives considered include ISO 14000 certification, pollution prevention, recycling of materials, and waste reduction; plant performance is assessed with the dimensions of the four competitive capabilities of quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost. Further, building on the theory of performance frontiers, we investigate these relationships across plants located in different economic regions of the world (plants are classified into emerging, developing and industrialized regions). We suggest that recent emphasis on these environmental initiatives has been greatest among plants located in emerging economies, compared to their counterparts in industrialized and developing nations. In addition, we contend that the influence of these initiatives is greatest for plants located in emerging and developing economies when compared to plants in industrialized nations. These notions are tested with data collected from 1211 plants located in these three economic regions. Overall, this study contributes to the investigation of strategies for sustainable business development, highlighting important implications for both theory and practice. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Integrated assessment methods are increasingly used for scenario approaches that enable policy-makers to explore possible futures and assess potential consequences of different policy or management strategies. The paper proposes a conceptual and operational framework to illustrate a scenario exercise, based on a previously developed model, by building on recently published progress on the participatory and model-based assessment approach. This framework focuses on information flows in two key operational phases, problem specification and adaptation of model outputs, where scientists and stakeholders interact. In both phases, transformation steps convert narrative information into a quantitative form (and vice-versa), thereby enabling scientists to apply computer models and decision-makers to get confident in model predictions. On the basis of four case studies aimed at solving complex water-resource management problems, we illustrate the difficulties, constraints and questions of each step of the proposed framework and present original solutions. This framework, which can be applied to all natural-resource management issues, clearly defines the step(s) at which each partner should be involved in a scenario exercise and his/her contribution. Consequently, by having greater foresight and transparency, the framework determines the nature of interactions between scientists and non-scientists. A posteriori, it also describes how a scenario exercise was conducted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Integrated assessment and modelling; Model output transformation; Participatory methods; Problem specification; Scenario; Water management","Integrated assessment; Model outputs; Participatory methods; Problem specification; Scenario; Specifications; Water management; Resource allocation; computer; natural resource; participatory approach; policy making; stakeholder; water management; water resource",,,,,"Alcamo, J., The SAS approach: combining qualitative and quantitative knowledge in environmental scenarios (2008) Environmental Futures.

Design: Retrospective comparison study. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients: A total of 56 skeletally mature individuals treated surgically for acute both-bone forearm fractures between July 2005 and December 2009. Monteggia, Galeazzi, and pathologic fractures, patients treated with external fixation and patients with traumatic brain injuries were excluded. Intervention: Twenty-seven patients were treated with dual plate fixation, and 29 patients were treated using a hybrid fixation construct. Main Outcome Measures: Time to union, range of motion as assessed using a Grace and Eversmann score, and presence of complications. Results: There was no significant difference in either time to union or Grace and Eversmann scores between the 2 groups. There was 1 nonunion in each of the 2 groups. Nine overall complications, outside nonunions, were reported: 5 in the dual plating group and 4 in the hybrid fixation group. Conclusions: Hybrid fixation, using open reduction and internal fixation with a plate-and-screw construct on the radius and closed- or minimally open-reduction and interlocked intramedullary fixation of the ulna, is an acceptable method for treating both-bone diaphyseal forearm fractures in skeletally mature patients.

The adoption of governance measures that surpass the national scope, reaching a transnational character, can contribute to avoid or to reduce these problems at least. But, in addition, globalisation seems to have accentuated the unpredictability of the crises, as it can be verified in the current one: it is a global crisis, and, what is more, despite the prior existence of warnings about several imbalances in financial markets and in the global economy, neither supervisors nor the multilateral organisations predicted the exact form that it would take, the timing of its onset and the nature of its consequences. However, this lack of foresight does not seem to be an inherent feature of the current crisis, but rather a common factor to external financial crises in the globalisation era. And it happens despite the existence of a large variety of methods to assess country risk and, therefore, to measure the risk of a crisis episode, particularly the so-called ""country risk indexes"". The aim of this chapter is to contrast whether the two indexes most known and used by experts, the Euromoney index and the ICRG, were capable of predicting well in advance the crises episodes that occurred during the period 1994-2002. For this purpose, we consider a sample that includes 13 countries in crisis and 50 countries which, even belonging to the same ""country risk group"" as the first, did not develop a crisis. On the basis of this sample, both discriminant and logistic regression analyses are performed in order to check the success of both indexes in discriminating between the two groups. The results indicate that neither of the selected indexes were suitable for carrying out this objective. These results suggest two conclusions: the first is that country risk indexes, although able to reflect a certain set of economic vulnerabilities, do not appear to identify the last combination of factors which trigger a crisis; the second is that in a globalised world the governance models must reject the approaches based on the easy predictability of economic events, assuming on the contrary the relevance of the uncertainty in the analysis and the management of the economic reality. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, a number of existing methods for involving users are abundantly described in the literature as reported by Pallot and colleagues (2010) while proposing a domain landscape of research and design methods supporting user involvement in R&D. On the other hand, the Design Creative City Living Lab has deployed the LUPI® methodology (Vérilhac, 2011) for involving all stakeholders, including users, at the earlier stage in opening a specific design lab. The LUPI® main strength consists in the proactiveness on the value creation chain from foresight up to the market (Jégou, 2009). Finally, there is the Design for All (DfA) approach and HUMBLES design method (Aragall, 2012) where products and services are adapted to the needs and wishes of all people, regardless of their differences. This paper briefly explores these different methods and tentatively tries to provide criteria for selecting design methods according to project specific aspects in integrating the DfA approach to meet the needs of all users whatever their differences. © 2012 IEEE.","Design for All; Living Labs; User Centred Design; User Cocreation; User Driven Open Innovation","Co-creation; Design for all; Living lab; Open innovation; User centred design; Innovation; Laboratories; Product design",,,,,"Aragall, F., Montana, J., (2012) Universal Design: The HUMBLES Method for User-Centred Business, , Publisher: Gower Publishing, Date: January 2012.

It deals with the current uses and practices of technology foresight conducted by biotechnology firms with a particular view to the possible contributions to innovation that foresight activities might bring in an entrepreneurial context. Furthermore, the article also explores whether the perceived usefulness of different foresight methodology differs with the sector and size of a firm. With the growing advancement of knowledge based economy, the knowledge of research, development and technologies has become a driver for economic progress and stimulus for social transformation which gives manifold dimensions to decision making of the technology driven industry. This phenomenon has made technology foresight activities all the more significant. © 2012, RIS.","Biotechnology; Foresight methodologies; Sectoral system of innovation; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Anderson, J., Foresight Analysis in Research Funding Agencies: A UK Experiment (1994) Higher Education, 28, pp. 39-54; Antunes, A., Canongia, C., Technological Foresight and Technological Scanning for Identifying Priorities and Opportunities: The Biotechnology and Health Sector (2006) Foresight, 8 (5), pp. 31-44; Balachandra, R., Perceived Usefulness of Technological Forecasting Techniques (1980) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 16, pp. 155-166; Barré, R., Synthesis of Technology Foresight (2002) Strategic Policy Intelligence: Current Trends, the State of Play and Perspectives, , in, Tübke, A., Ducatel, K., Gavigan, J. and Moncada, P.

The convergence of a Cournot oligopoly game with nonlinear cost functions is investigated in this paper, where each firm is assumed able to have simple foresight with respect to its rivals' choices in the sense of extrapolative expectations. We eventually arrive at a conclusion that extrapolative expectations act as a stabilizing factor, especially when the foresight is strong enough. This seemingly rational mechanism is therefore desirable since the corresponding long-term behavior will become more predicable.","Convergence; Cournot oligopoly; Equilibrium behavior; Extrapolative expectations; Stabilizing factor",,,,,,"Arrow, K.J., Nerlove, M., A note on expectations and stability (1958) Econometrica, 26 (2), pp. 297-305; Agiza, H.N., Elsadany, A.A., Chaotic dynamics in nonlinear duopoly game with heterogeneous players (2004) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 149, pp. 843-860; Angelini, N., Dieci, R., Nardini, F., Bifurcation analysis of a dynamic duopoly model with heterogeneous costs and behavioural rules (2009) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 79, pp. 3179-3196; Bischi, G.I., Kopel, M., Equilibrium selection in a nonlinear duopoly game with adaptive expectations (2001) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 46, pp. 73-100; Enthoven, A.C., Arrow, K.J., A theorem on expectations and stability of equilibrium (1956) Econometrica, 24 (3), pp. 288-293; Fisher, F.M., The stability of the Cournot oligopoly solution: The effects of speeds of adjustment and increasing marginal costs (1961) Review of Economic Studies, 28 (2), pp. 125-135; Huck, S., Normann, H.T., Oechssler, J., Learning in Cournot oligopoly-an experiment (1999) The Economic Journal, 109, pp. 80-95; Kopel, M., Simple and complex adjustment dynamics in Cournot duopoly models (1996) Chaos, Soliton & Fractals, 7 (12), pp. 2031-2048; Kamalinejad, H., Majda, V.J., Kebriaei, H., Kian, A.R., Cournot games with linear regression expectations in oligopolistic markets (2010) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 80, pp. 1874-1885; Marden, J.R., Arslan, G., Shamma, J.S., Joint strategy fictitious play with inertia for potential games (2009) IEEE Transactions on automatic control, 54 (2), pp. 208-220; Matsumoto, A., Controlling the Cournot-Nash chaos (2006) Journal of optimization theory and applications, 128 (2), pp. 379-392; Naimzada, A.K., Tramontana, F., A dynamic model of a boundedly rational consumer with a simple least squared learning mechanism (2010) Computational Economics, 36, pp. 47-56; Quandt, R.E., On the stability of price adjusting oligopoly (1967) Southern Economic Journal, 33, pp. 332-336; Theocharis, R.D., On the stability of the Cournot solution on the oligopoly problem (1959) Review of Economic Studies, 27, pp. 133-134; Valléea, T., Yildizoglub, M., Convergence in the finite Cournot oligopoly with social and individual learning (2009) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 72, pp. 670-690","Gao, X.; School of Economics and Management, Southeast UniversityChina; email: gxingstar@163.com",,,,,,,,0424267X,,,,"English","Econ.

Foresight studies are recognised as being useful in generating the kind of actionable knowledge required by exerting multi-stakeholder governance of such societal processes in a precautionary way. This paper presents the outcomes of a first round of a Delphi survey undertaken in 2011 on the risks affecting the development of the information society in the Republic of Moldova; a customised methodology was adopted in designing the questionnaire, most items being peculiar to the decision-type Delphi. The survey outcomes indicated that Republic of Moldova's information society actually reached a mid-range stage between ""disarticulated"" and ""world leader"", on a scale based upon the International Telecommunications Union's ""8 Cs framework"". The development of the country's information society was rated as a top priority of the current public agenda that also stands in the medium- and long-term future and is steadily supported by the state, although mainly in declarative terms. The most severe risk identified is that of the country's research system and higher education system keeping functioning in a barely survival regime, under-financed and loosely coupled; in turn, the main vulnerability deemed to affect Republic of Moldova's participation in the European Union's 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (2007- 2013) consist of the insufficient attractiveness of income and academic career prospects domestically available to young professionals.

We consider 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional overlapping generations models, a cash-in-advance model, heterogeneous markets and a cobweb model with adaptive adjustment. We consider the inverse limit spaces of certain chaotic invariant fractal sets and their metric, ergodic and stability properties. The inverse limits give the set of intertemporal perfect foresight equilibria for the economic problem considered. First we show that the inverse limits of these models are stable under perturbations. We then employ utility functions on inverse limits in our case. We give two ways to rank such utility functions. First, when perturbing certain dynamical systems, we rank utility functions in terms of their average values with respect to invariant probability measures on inverse limits, especially with respect to measures of maximal entropy. For families of certain unimodal maps we can adjust both the discount factor and the system parameters in order to obtain maximal average value of the utility. The second way to rank utility functions (for more general maps on hyperbolic sets) will be to use equilibrium measures of these utility functions on inverse limits; they optimize average values of utility functions while at the same time keeping the disorder in the system as low as possible in the long run. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive adjustment cobweb model; Chaotic maps; Entropy; Homoclinic orbits; Invariant measures; Inverse limits; Non-invertible economic dynamics; Overlapping generations model; Utility functions",,,,,,"Onozaki, T., Sieg, G., Yokoo, M., Complex dynamics in a cobweb model with adaptive production adjustment (2000) J.

Good information is fundamental to understand and respond to 21st century national security threats. Without comprehensive information, decision-makers operate with a limited understanding of the threat horizon or the best means to address it. Required information exists across a variety of proprietary and open sources, and the volume of data available that might potentially contain relevant facts is simply too large and the bandwidth of the trained analysts is limited. Such information must be available in time-critical situations to be able to quickly connect the dots across various related pieces of information. It is imperative that decision-makers are provided intelligent tools that can automatically extract new relevant information from data without being explicitly asked, leading to actionable intelligence. To overcome these challenges we propose an information collection, management and analysis framework to meet the ever-growing threats to national security. The proposed framework establishes a collaborative environment to semi-automatically generate actionable intelligence by ensuring that the right people have access to all inclusive information at the right time. The core of this framework is to create a single view of entity by correlating information from different sources, stored in different formats. These sources can be passport, immigration, driving license, FIR records, Telecom and Utility services. The correlation algorithm is able to handle varied amount of noise in the data such as syntactic and semantic variations, format changes, spelling error, incomplete data, regional and linguistics variation as well as addition or removal of fields. The framework can further exploit the consolidated view to discover relationships between entities thus expanding the reach for relevant information. The framework provides multiple avenues of interaction and the foresight needed to incorporate new sources of data as they arise in future. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Collaborative environments; Comprehensive information; Consolidation solutions; Correlation algorithm; Decision makers; Driving license; Format change; Human expert; Incomplete data; Information collections; Intelligent tools; Internal security; National security; New sources; Open sources; Relationships between entities; Spelling errors; Telecom; Information technology; Semantics; Information science",,,,,"Rahm, E., Do, H.-H., Data Cleaning: Problems and Current Approaches (2000) IEEE Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering, 23 (4). , December; Maletic, J.I., Marcus, A., Data Cleansing: Beyond Integrity Analysis Proceedings of the Conference on Information Quality (IQ2000); Gu, L., Baxter, R., Vickers, D., Rainsford, C., Record Linkage: Current Practice and Future Directions (2003) CSIRO Mathematical and Information Sciences; Chaudhuri, S., Ganjam, K., Ganti, V., Kapoor, R., Narasayya, V., Vassilakis, T., Data cleaning in microsoft SQL server 2005 Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, June 14-16, 2005, Baltimore, Maryland; Fuxman, A., Fazli, E., Miller, R.J., ConQuer: Efficient management of inconsistent databases Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, June 14-16, 2005, Baltimore, Maryland; Dasu, T., Johnson, T., Muthukrishnan, S., Shkapenyuk, V., Mining database structure; or, how to build a data quality browser Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, June 03-06, 2002, Madison, Wisconsin; Farinha, J., Trigueiros, M.J., Belo, O., Using inheritance in a metadata based approach to data quality assessment Conference on Information and Knowledge Management Archive Proceeding of the First International Workshop on Model Driven Service Engineering and Data Quality and Security; Galhardas, H., Florescu, D., Shasha, D., Simon, E., Declaratively cleaning your data using AJAX (2000) Journees Bases de Donnees, , http://caravel.inria.fr/gal-harda/BDA.ps, Oct; Galhardas, H., Florescu, D., Shasha, D., Simon, E., AJAX: An Extensible Data Cleaning Tool (2000) Proc.

Future Radar 2030 is a foresight process, in which tools from foresight are applied to work out scenarios and perform a survey. In combination with future workshops, the foresight process and its results have a direct impact on the stakeholders of a German federal state. It, therefore, has implications for society in general, but also for the innovation system. The paper describes the background (demographic change) and the tools from forecasting and foresight that were combined to work out relevant issues. It argues that even a 'small' regional foresight activity has an impact and changes some path of thinking.

Using a sample of 480 business students from eight universities in Klang Valley, results reveal that the major causes of academic stress are due to conflicts and pressures that ultimately cause a detrimental effect on health and performance. While undergraduates most often tend to use avoidant-focused coping strategies to reduce stress, problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies are the preferred choice to alleviate stress. Results provide university administrators with some proactive insights into student services and curriculum design to address excessive levels of academic stress among students.

In general, we know from experience that it can be very difficult to retrofit systems with new implementations to make them trustworthy, especially if they were developed on insecure platforms without the benefit of securityaware development practices. Thus, a well-reasoned understanding of the trade-offs is essential before potentially sacrificing possible future opportunities in an effort to satisfy short-term goals. One complicating factor is that much more knowledge of the past and the present-and appreciation of the effects of possible futures-is needed to intelligently making such trade-offs. © 2012 ACM.",,"Development practices; Human safety; Possible futures; Security-aware; Short term; Computer applications; Computer science; Commerce",,,,,"Dave, N., (2011) A Unified Model for Hardware/Software Codesign, , Ph.

The so-called improvements planned by liquid-based industrial coatings producers are simply designed to reduce the use of solvents and replace them with water-based materials since this enables them to continue with their traditional methods of manufacture. The simple polymer structure of a UVcurable binder makes it an ideal candidate for introducing new polymer design practices. The constrictions of adhering to heat-curing polymer design will never allow the polymer chemist to put all the essential components into a molecular structure that will ensure uniform and complete cure of the coatings binder.

Still a gadget, the idea revived one of the old promises of computers as personal assistants. Does it have the potential of fulfilling the already burgeoning imagination related to this promise? The authors believe that, while still dependent on the evolution of artificial intelligence, the virtual assistant may find support in the already maturing technologies of augmented reality and, more important, in the changing global network with the semantic web, Internet of things and geo-location. Bluntly speaking, its feasibility and acceptability may not even have to wait for the promised IBM computer with human brain capabilities, but rather build on a more friendly interaction with the Google search engine.The article provides a narrative scenario of the deep economic and social transformations and even turbulence that the so called imaginary friend may produce. Not discarding, but creatively integrating some of the archetypes of futuristic literature, the story positions these entities as the foreground of a deep integration of networks, with the added turmoil caused by economic interests that go beyond individuals' sense-making capacity.This article is one of the follow-ups of the international foresight workshop "" Crazy futures"" coordinated by Ziauddin Sardar and George Cairns in a small resort on the Danube Delta in July 2011, a workshop organised as part of the project Quality and Leadership for Romanian Higher Education. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Augmented reality; Clash of networks; Internet psychology; Virtual persons","feasibility study; higher education; Internet; language; mobile communication; virtual reality",,,,,,"Gheorghiu, R.; Institute for World Economy, Bucharest, Romania; email: gheorghiu.radu.cristian@gmail.com",,,,,,,,00163287,,,,"English","Futures",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864004543

Specifically, the article suggests a new model that integrates assumptions of the lens model on accurate personality judgments and accounts that view hindsight effects as a by-product of knowledge updating. We suggest 3 processes that have the potential to explain the occurrence of hindsight effects in personality judgments: (a) changes in an individual's cue perceptions, (b) changes in the utilization of more valid cues, and (c) changes in the consistency with which cue knowledge is applied. In 2 studies (N1 = 91, N2 = 93), participants were presented with target pictures and were asked to judge each target's levels of the Big Five. Thereafter, they received feedback and had to recall their original judgments. Results show that there were clear hindsight effects for all 5 personality dimensions. Importantly, we found evidence that both the utilization of more valid cues and changes in cue perceptions-but not changes in the consistency with which cue knowledge is applied-account for the hindsight effects. Implications of these results for models explaining hindsight effects, the inference of personality judgments, and the accuracy of these inferences are discussed. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","Accuracy; Hindsight bias; Human inferences; Knowledge updating; Lens model; Personality judgments","adult; article; decision making; epidemiology; female; human; knowledge; male; perception; personality; psychological model; Adult; Bias (Epidemiology); Female; Humans; Judgment; Knowledge; Male; Models, Psychological; Personality; Social Perception; Young Adult",,,,,"Albright, L., Malloy, T.E., Self-observation of behavior and metaperception (1999) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77, pp. 726-734. , doi:10.1037/0022-3514.77.4.726; Alloy, L.B., Tabachnik, N., Assessment of covariation by humans and animals: The joint influence of prior expectations and current situational information (1984) Psychological Review, 91, pp. 112-149. , doi:10.1037/0033-295X.91.1.112; Ambady, N., Rosenthal, R., Half a minute: Predicting teacher evaluations from thin slices of nonverbal behavior and physical attractiveness (1993) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64, pp. 431-441. , doi:10.1037/0022-3514.64.3.431; Ambady, N., Skowronski, J.J., (2008) First impressions, , New York, NY: Guilford Press, Eds; Arkes, H.R., Faust, D., Guilmette, T.J., Hart, K., Eliminating the hindsight bias (1988) Journal of Applied Psychology, 73, pp. 305-307. , doi:10.1037/0021-9010.73.2.305; Asendorpf, J.B., Individual response profiles in the behavioral assessment of personality (1988) European Journal of Personality, 2, pp. 155-167. , doi:10.1002/per.2410020209; Back, M.D., Baumert, A., Denissen, J.J.A., Hartung, F.-M., Penke, L., Schmukle, S.C., Wrzus, C., PERSOC: A unified framework for understanding the dynamic interplay of personality and social relationships (2011) European Journal of Personality, 25, pp. 90-107. , doi:10.1002/per.811; Back, M.D., Egloff, B., Yes we can!

After going over the statistical definition of these spaces, how that definition has changed over time and the characteristic typology of the spaces, they give an account of low-density French territories based on four major areas of observation: the different populations involved, the changes to their economic fabric, their powers of attraction and their modes of social regulation. Stressing that the place of these spaces in the spatial order has changed greatly in recent years, with what were once ""territories in difficulty"" becoming more attractive territories offering new opportunities, Barthe and Milian outline the five scenarios envisaged for the years to 2040: ""Community Archipelagos"" (demographic shrinkage and deregulation); ""Productive Platforms"" (strengthening of productive activities in agriculture, energy and the environment); ""Low Density Reabsorbed"" (in other words, overtaken by urban sprawl); ""Enterprising Systems"" (banking on innovation); and ""The Urban Areas' Forward Zone"" (these territories becoming part of a more general paradigm of ""sustainable towns/cities""). Barthe and Milian go on to analyse two major challenges for low-density spaces in relation to the more general work carried out as part of Territories 2040: the enhanced capacity of these territories (in other words, their ability to control their destinies and find a place in the overall territorial system) and the ecological development of their resources.",,,,,,,"Béteille, R., Montagné-Villette, S., Rural profond (1995) Français, , Paris: SEDES (coll.

The consequences of this uncertainty on optimal dam dimensioning is assessed for a small mountainous catchment in Greece. Optimal dam design is estimated using a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) based on trends in seasonal temperature and precipitations from 19 IPCC-AR4 climate models driven by the the SRES A2 emission scenario. Optimal reservoir volumes are modified by climate change, leading to up to 34% differences between optimal volumes. Contrary to widely-used target-based approaches, the CBA suggests that reduced rainfall should lead to smaller water reservoirs. The resulting change in the Net Present Value (NPV) of water supply is also substantial, ranging from no change to a large 25% loss, depending on the climate model, even assuming optimal adaptation and perfect foresight. In addition, climate change uncertainty can lead to design errors, with a cost ranging from 0. 3 to 2. 8% of the NPV, depending on site characteristics. This paper proposes to complement the CBA with a robust decision-making approach that focuses on reducing design-error costs. It also suggests that climate change impacts in the water sector may reveal large, that water reservoirs do not always provide a cost-efficient adaptation strategy, and that alternative adaptation strategies based on water conservation and non-conventional water production need to be considered. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Adaptation strategies; Climate change impact; Cost-efficient; Dam design; Design errors; Emission scenario; Net present value; Optimal adaptation; Reservoir volume; Robust decisions; Seasonal temperature; Site characteristics; Uncertain climate; Water production; Water sector; Catchments; Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Design; Optimization; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Uncertainty analysis; Water conservation; Water supply; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; cost-benefit analysis; dam construction; decision making; error analysis; hydrological response; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; reservoir; seasonality; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis; water management; water supply; Greece; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",,,,,"Brikowski, T.H., Doomed reservoirs in Kansas, USA?

Dixon Entrance and their vulnerability to an oil spill if one were to occur in that region. The foresight and cooperation of those parties resulted in the creation of a set of wildlife response guidelines that would ensure a joint, coordinated wildlife response effort of U.S. and Canadian agencies in the protection from and the response to an oil spill in those waters. Appropriately, the developed guidelines were adopted as an appendix of the CANUS Marine Pollution Contingency Plan CANUSDIX Annex. In the Great Lakes region there are thousands of kilometers of ideal nesting and feeding habitat and shoreline, utilized by migratory birds and dozens of other sensitive wildlife species. Their flyways and habitats criss-cross the lakes recognizing no boundaries other than their own. The Great Lakes may be one of the most important regions in the migration path and hold several critical staging areas for migrating birds. It is vitally important to ensure that when a spill does occur, the coordination between Canadian and U.S. environmental protection and wildlife resource agencies is flawless. In recent and ongoing efforts to ensure that the coordination of environmental protection and wildlife resource agencies is reliable Environment Canada Environmental Emergencies Ontario Region began a process to recognize and utilize the work of the Dixon Entrance group and adapt it to the Great Lakes Region. Additionally, through existing preparedness activities, EC Ontario Region is striving to strengthen the network of environmental protection and wildlife resource agencies, to promote coordination among them and to work cooperatively to fill any identified gaps in the preparedness for and response to oiled wildlife.",,"Contingency plans; Great lakes; Migrating birds; Migration path; Migratory birds; Ontario; Preparedness and response; Wildlife species; Contamination; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Lakes; Marine pollution; Natural resources; Oil spills; Technical presentations; Vehicular tunnels; Animals",,,,,"(2000) Important Bird Areas, , http://www.ibacanada.com/index.jsp?lang=en, Bird Studies Canada and Nature Canada, Canada website; Bergman, P., Russo, N., Joint canada/united states wildlife response planning: Dixon entrance (2001) Proceedings International Oil Spill Conference, , Tampa FL; Boulden environmental consulting (2000) Oiled Birds and the Courts, , A Status Report on the Canadian Situation; Brown, M., (2012) ECRC Great Lakes Region, , Private Communication; (2006) CANUSDIX Annex - Operational Appendix: Wildlife Response Guidelines, , Canada - United States Marine Pollution Contingency Plan; (1999) Canadian Wildlife Service, Canadian Wildlife Service National Policy on Oiled Birds and Oiled Species at Risk, pp. 1-6. , Environment Canada, Nov; Canadian Wildlife Service, Canadian Wildlife Service National Strike Team for Oil Spill Response - Terms of Reference, pp. 1-4. , Environment Canada; (1990) Canadian Wildlife Service, Canadian Wildlife Service Policy on Oiled Birds, , Environment Canada, April; Janelle, R., (1998) Canadian Coast Guard/United States Coast Guard, CANUSDIX 98 Ketchikan, pp. 2-4. , Alaska, August 24-27 Meeting Summary and Work List; Monroe, J., Canadian coast guard/united states coast guard (2011) CANUSLAK 2011 Sault Ste.

The Foresight map is used as a heuristic tool to show the various reasons why obesity can be viewed as an emergent property of a complex system, and the chapter then explains the implications of accepting obesity as complex and introduces solutions appropriate for complex problems. Even without a detailed description of the hallmarks of complex systems, the Foresight obesity system map does an excellent job of conveying the notion that obesity is a complex problem. As illustrated, this complexity exists on many different levels and by many different mechanisms, any one of which by itself may make the problem seem intractable. Through application of an Intervention Level Framework, one can comprehend the many actions that are needed to address obesity at multiple levels of the system. © 2011 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

It explains that it was during this year that a spiritual dispensation that had underwritten social and cultural life in England for generations was officially erased from the nation's cultural memory, and beliefs that had been central to official and popular culture for centuries were declared definitively to be false. © University Press, 2014.","1547; Cultural life; Cultural memory; England; Medieval period; Social life; Spiritual dispensation",,,,,,"Aers, D., A Whisper in the Ear of Early Modernists: Or Reflection on Literary Critics Writing the ""History of the Subject"" (1992) Culture and History, 1350-1600: Essays on English Communities, Identities, and Writing, pp. 177-202. , David Aers (ed.), Detroit: Wayne State University Press; Bernard, G.W., (2005) The King's Reformation, , New Haven: Yale University Press; Bolgar, R.R., (1958) The Classical Heritage and its Beneficiaries, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Burns, R.I., (1985) The Worlds of Alfonso the Learned and James the Conqueror, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Burrow, C., The Experience of Exclusion: Literature and Politics in the Reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII (1999) The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature, pp. 793-820. , David Wallace (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Chaucer, G., (1532) The Workes of Geffray Chaucer newly Printed..., , London: Thomas Godfray; Coleman, C., Starkey, D., (1986) Revolution Reassessed; Revisions in the History of Tudor Government and Administration, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Cummings, B., Reformed Literature and Literature Reformed (1999) The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature, pp. 821-851. , David Wallace (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Cummings, B., (2002) The Literary Culture of the Reformation: Grammar and Grace, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Duffy, E., (1994) The Stripping of the Altars, , New Haven: Yale University Press; Elton, G.R., (1953) The Tudor Revolution in Government, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Elton, G.R., (1973) Policy and Police: the Enforcement of the Reformation in the Age of Thomas Cromwell, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Gunn, S.J., (1995) Early Tudor Government, 1485-1558, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Hattaway, M., (2005) Renaissance and Reformations: An Introduction to Early Modern English Literature, , Oxford: Blackwell; Hughes, P.L., Larkin, J.F., (1964) Tudor Royal Proclamations, p. i. , New Haven: Yale University Press; Lapidge, M., (2002) Anglo-Latin Literature, 900-1060, p. ii. , London: Hambledon Press; Lerer, S., (1993) Chaucer and his Readers, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Lerer, S., (1997) Courtly Letters in the Age of Henry VIII: Literary Culture and the Arts of Deceit, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Patterson, L., Critical Historicism and Medieval Studies (1990) Literary Practice and Social Change in Britain, 1380-1530, pp. 1-14. , Lee Patterson (ed.), Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, adapted and expanded from Patterson, 'On the Margin: Postmodernism, Ironic History, and Medieval Studies', Speculum, 65 (1990): 87-108; Puttenham, G., (2007) The Art of English Poesy by George Puttenham: A Critical Edition, , ed.

However, some argue that using wood as an energy feedstock will result in decreased forest stocks and thereby a net reduction of carbon sequestered by forests. Such arguments fail to recognize that increased demand for wood bioenergy could increase stocks of wood, a renewable resource. We address the carbon neutrality question using a dynamic optimization forest management model to examine the effect of increasing or decreasing wood bioenergy demand on an existing forest, both in the amount of carbon lost by harvests and in that captured by forest management adjustments that change forest stocks under various wood demand and land supply scenarios. The results suggest for a managed regulated forest using foresight, an anticipated substantial increase in future wood biomass demand will not reduce forest and forest carbon stocks, but rather will increase the forest and forest carbon, thus being somewhat self-regulating. © 2012 Society of American Foresters.","Carbon; Carbon neutrality; Forest; Harvests; Rational expectations; Wood bioenergy","Bio-energy; Carbon neutrals; Carbon stocks; Dynamic optimization; Energy productions; Forest; Harvests; Land supply; Rational expectations; Renewable resource; Wood biomass; Wood demand; Carbon; Wood; Forestry; bioenergy; biomass; carbon sequestration; forest management; numerical model; optimization; renewable resource; Carbon; Forestry; Harvesting; Wood",,,,,"Alig, R.J., Adams, D.M., Callaway, J.M., Winnett, S.M., McCarl, B.A., Assessing effects of mitigation strategies for global climate change with an intertemporal model of the US forest and agriculture sectors (1997) Environ.

Its main functionality is to investigate, elicit, and apply rules and principles that govern the development processes of technologies and related markets. Specifically, we will focus on applications of the tool to model the evolution of information technology (IT). We will distinguish several relevant subsystems of the system under study, which describe the demographic, education, global economic trends, as well as specific market factors that determine the demand for and use of IT. The group modelling techniques are implemented in the new tool to enable the collaborative and distributed model building with intelligent verification of entries called 'model wiki'. Based on the information elicited from experts, gathered from the web and professional databases, a discrete-time control model of technological evolution emerges, coupled with a controlled discrete-event system. The latter processes qualitative information and models the influence of external events and trends on the discrete-time control system parameters. We propose novel uncertainty handling techniques capable of processing and combining different types of uncertain information, coming i.a. from Delphi research and forecasts. The quantitative information is dynamically updated by autonomous webcrawlers, following an adaptive intelligent strategy. The resulting model can be used to simulate long-term future trends and scenarios. Its ultimate goal is to perform an optimization process and derive recommendations for decision makers, for example when selecting IT investment strategies in an innovative enterprise. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Complex Systems; Decision Support Systems; Discrete-Time Control; Foresight; Group Modelling Tool; Hybrid Models; Model Discovery","Complex system dynamics; Decision makers; Development process; Discrete-time control; Distributed models; Foresight; Global economics; Heterogeneous information; Hybrid model; Innovative enterprise; Intelligent data; IT investments; Long-term future; Market factors; Modelling techniques; Modelling tools; On-line modelling; Optimization process; Qualitative information; Quantitative information; Technological evolution; Theoretical foundations; Uncertain informations; Uncertainty handling; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Discrete time control systems; Investments; Large scale systems; Information technology",,,,,"Ackermann, F., Andersen, D.F., Eden, C., Richardson, G.P., ScriptsMap: A tool for designing multi-method policy-making workshops (2011) Omega, 39, pp. 427-434; Antoniou, I., Reeve, M., Stenning, V., The Information Society as a Complex System (2000) Journal of Universal Computer Science, 6 (3), pp. 272-288; Bérard, C., Group Model Building Using System Dynamics: An Analysis of Methodological Frameworks (2010) Elect.

After tracing the 40 year-long development of imaginal visioning methods by the author, foundational concepts are introduced that support the idea of personal, interpersonal and transpersonal co-creative partnerships in the use and communication of imaginal visioning for prophetic foresight.","Conscious evolution; Evolution; Foresight; Imaginal visioning; Intuition; Prophetic foresight; Visioning; Wise futures",,,,,,"Anderson, R., Intuitive inquiry (2011) Transforming Self and Others through Research: Transpersonal Research Methods and Skills for the Human Sciences and Humanities, pp. 15-70. , Chapter 1Albany, NY: SUNY Press; Anderson, R., Braud, W., (2011) Transforming Self and Others through Research: Transpersonal Research Methods and Skills for the Human Sciences and Humanities, , Albany, NY: SUNY Press; Bailey, M.D., (2011) Fixing Broken Robots: A Transliminal Perspective, , I.

It has a range of applications and is used with different methods, for different objectives and in different settings. Yet, anticipation in science and technology is not limited to foresight, but occurs in many more informal ways. This paper investigates the phenomenon that socio-technical developments are saturated with formal and informal anticipations and discusses the implications of this condition for foresight. The range of foresight studies is reviewed as well as the main results of the sociology of expectations, which studies the informal production and circulation of expectations in science and technology. Finally, three generic lessons from the sociology of expectations are derived, and it is discussed how these support or limit the ambitions of foresight. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","expectations of technological change; foresight; technological change and dynamics; technology and innovation studies; technology road mapping","innovation; mapping; technological change; technological development",,,,,"Antonelli, C., The role of technological expectations in a mixed model of international diffusion of process innovations: The case of open-end spinning rotors (1989) Research Policy, 18 (5), pp. 273-288; Bakker, S., van Lente, H., Meeus, M., Arenas of expectations for hydrogen technologies (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78 (1), pp. 152-162; Berkhout, F., Normative expectations in systems innovation (2006) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 18 (3-4), pp. 299-311; Berube, D.M., (2006) NanoHype: The truth behind the nanotechnology buzz, , New York: Promotheus Books; Borup, M., Brown, N., Konrad, K., van Lente, H., The sociology of expectations in science and technology (2006) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 18 (3-4), pp. 285-298; Braun, E., (1995) Futile progress: Technology's empty promise, , London: Earthscan; Brown, N., Hope against hype: Accountability in biopasts, presents and futures (2003) Science Studies, 16 (2), pp. 3-21; Brown, N., Rappert, B., Webster, A., (2000) Contested futures: A sociology of prospective techno-science, , In: Brown N., Rappert B., Webster A., editors Aldershot: Ashgate; Brown, N., Michael, M., A sociology of expectations: Retrospecting prospects and prospecting retrospects (2003) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 15 (1), pp. 3-18; Cagnin, C., Loveridge, D., Saritas, O., FTA and equity: New approaches to governance (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 279-291; Coates, V., Farooque, M., Klavans, R., Lapid, K., Linstone, H.A., Pistorius, C., Porter, A.L., On the future of technological forecasting (2001) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 67 (1), pp. 1-17; Collins, H., Pinch, T., (1993) The golem: What you should know about science, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Collins, H., Pinch, T., (1998) The golem at large: What you should know about technology, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: Insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 20 (3), pp. 369-387; Dierkes, M., Hoffmann, U., Marz, L., (1996) Visions of technology: Social and institutional factors shaping the development of new technologies, , New York: St Martin's Press; Douthwaite, B., Keatinge, J.D.H., Park, J.R., Why promising technologies fail: The neglected role of user innovation during adoption (2001) Research Policy, 30 (5), pp. 819-836; Eames, M., McDowall, W., Hodson, M., Marvin, S., Negotiating contested visions and place-specific expectations of the hydrogen economy (2006) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 18 (3-4), pp. 361-374; Eerola, A., Miles, I., Methods and tools contributing to FTA: A knowledge-based perspective (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 265-278; Froot, K.A., Scharftstein, D.S., Stein, J.C., Herd on the street: Informational inefficiencies in a market with short-term speculation (1992) Journal of Finance, 47 (4), pp. 1461-1484; Geels, F.W., Smit, W.A., Failed technology futures: Pitfalls and lessons from a historical survey (2000) Futures, 32 (9-10), pp. 867-885; Gordon, T.J., Glenn, J.C., Jakil, A., Frontiers of futures research: What's next?

Our research is based on a multiple-case study of corporate organisations that recently faced major changes in their external environment and increasing turbulence. We expand our understanding of environmental uncertainty by defining the concept of 'boundary uncertainty', which regards the identity of the components of the business (micro) environment. We distinguish between 'continuous' and 'discontinuous' drivers of change and find that they entail different requirements for the design and implementation of strategic foresight actions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","environmental uncertainty; learning; planning; strategic foresight; strategic management","corporate strategy; decision making; learning; management practice",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Critique of Henry Mintzberg's 'The design school': Reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12 (6), pp. 449-461; Becker, P., Corporate foresight in Europe: A first overview (2002) RTD K-2 Scientific and Technological Foresight, , Brussels: European Commission; Bradley, M.R., Costanzo, L.A., Introduction (2009) In Handbook of research on strategic foresight, , ed.

In this paper, a two-stage technology foresight approach is proposed. During the first stage, critical technologies are identified and evaluated by nationwide experts through Delphi surveys. In the second stage, a system dynamics simulation model is used to estimate how critical parameter values are likely to impact the attainment of foresight goals. A detailed illustration of this two-stage process is provided by a technology foresight case study in the Chinese information and communication technologies (ICT) industry. Because it was identified by the first-stage Delphi method as a critical technology, the diffusion of 4th generation wireless telecommunication technology (4G) was simulated, and experimentation was conducted. Suggestions are provided regarding how the Chinese information industry would need to expand the IP network infrastructure in order to support technology foresight goals under different scenarios. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Innovation diffusion; Simulation; System dynamics modeling; Technology foresight","Critical parameter values; Critical technologies; Delphi method; ICT industries; Industry needs; Information and Communication Technologies; Information industry; Innovation diffusion; IP networks; Simulation; Support technology; System dynamics modeling; System dynamics simulation; Technology foresight; Two-stage process; Wireless telecommunication technologies; Computer simulation; Industry; Innovation; Information technology; computer simulation; information and communication technology; innovation; Internet; technological development; telecommunication; China",,,,,"Miles, I., The development of technology foresight: a review (2010) Technol.

It is no surprise that new approaches to futures / foresight research and engagement are being developed in the context of these technologies and emerging practices. In dwelling within this juxtaposition between participatory futures and the maturing network era, we ask what the implications are for foresight / futures studies, and how this can help us re-imagine Anticipatory Democracy in the 21st century. A developmental narrative for the emergence of the network form in futures studies provides context for our understanding of new pathways. Within this we identify key emerging issues with implications for Anticipatory Democracy: instantiation, replication, openness and control. Explicated, these emerging issues provide a rich picture of the challenges and possibilities for building Anticipatory Democracy in the network era.","Anticipatory democracy; Collective intelligence; Network form; Participatory foresight; Peer-to-peer",,,,,,"Arquilla, J., Ronfeldt, D., (1999) The Emergence of Noopolitik, , Santa Monica, CA: RAND; Bezold, C., (1978) Anticipatory Democracy, , People in the Politics of the Future.

We emphasize the consequences on mitigation costs of considering the interplay between a) technical systems inertia, including slow infrastructure turnover in transportation and construction; and b) imperfect foresight influencing investment decisions. To this end, the hybrid general equilibrium modeling framework Imaclim-R is employed as it allows for transitory partial adjustments of the economy and captures their impact on the dynamics of economic growth. The modeling exercise quantitatively emphasizes the a) specific risks that the interplay between inertia and imperfect foresight leads to high macroeconomic costs of carbon abatement measures; b) opportunities of co-benefits from climate policies permitted by the correction of sub-optimalities in the reference scenarios. The article draws insights for the framing of future climate architectures by studying the role of measures that act complementarily to carbon pricing in the transport sector. In particular, reallocating public investment towards low-carbon transport infrastructure significantly reduces the overall macroeconomic costs of a given GHG stabilization target and even creates the room for long-term net economic benefits from climate policies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon abatement; Carbon pricing; Climate policy; Economic benefits; Economic growths; Future climate; General equilibrium; Investment decisions; Low carbon; Mitigation costs; Public investments; Stabilization target; Technical systems; Transition costs; Transport infrastructure; Transport sectors; Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Investments; Risk perception; Costs; carbon; cost-benefit analysis; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental policy; future prospect; long-term change; mitigation",,,,,"Ahmad, S., On the theory of induced innovation (1966) Econ J, 76, pp. 344-357; Armington, P.S., A Theory of Demand for Products Distinguished by Place of Production (1969) IMF, International Monetary Fund Staff Papers, 16, pp. 170-201; Arrow, K.J., Debreu, G., Existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy (1954) Econometrica, 22, pp. 265-290; Barker, T., Scrieciu, S.S., Low stabilization within a ""New Economics"" macro-econometric framework: insights from E3MG (2010) The economics of low stabilization.

The evolution of this amount is very sensitive to human diets and to the productivity of feed. This article provides a 2050 foresight on the necessary increase in crop production for food and feed in three contrasting scenarios: diets with no animal products; current diets in each main region of the world; and the average diet of developed countries extended to the whole world. We develop empirical aggregate production models for seven world regions, using 43 years and 150 countries. These models realistically account for the contribution of feed from food plants (i.e. plants that would be edible for humans) and of grassland to animal products. We find that the amount of edible crops necessary to feed livestock in 2050 is between 8% and 117% of today's need. The latter figure is lower than that in comparable foresight studies because our models take into account empirical features occurring at an aggregate level, such as the increasing share of animal production from regions using less crop product per unit of animal product. In particular, the expected increase in animal production is estimated to occur mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where the amount of feed from food crops required per unit of animal product proves to be lower than that in other areas. This 117% increase indicates that crop production would have to double if the whole world adopted the present diet of developed countries. © The Animal Consortium 2011.","calories; diets; feed; livestock; production function","animal; animal food; animal husbandry; article; biological model; catering service; classification; crop; diet; growth, development and aging; human; livestock; methodology; population growth; poultry; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Crops, Agricultural; Diet; Food Supply; Humans; Livestock; Models, Biological; Population Growth; Poultry; Animalia",,,,,"Bouwman, A.F., Van Der Hoek, K.W., Eickhout, B., Soenario, I., Exploring changes in world monogastric production systems (2005) Agricultural Systems, 84, pp. 121-153; De Haan, C., Steinfeld, H., Blackburn, H., (1999) Livestock and the Environment: Finding A Balance, , Coordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.

The article addresses potentially problematic issues with the implementation and evaluation of reflective writing assignments in clinical courses. With foresight and planning, reflective writing may be an empowering strategy for facilitating students' thinking skills.","Critical Thinking; Evaluation; Reflection; Reflective Writing; Teaching","article; attitude to health; educational model; human; methodology; nursing education; nursing student; psychological aspect; self disclosure; teaching; writing; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Models, Educational; Nursing Education Research; Self Disclosure; Students, Nursing; Teaching; Writing",,,,,"Allen, S., The revolution of nursing pedagogy: A transformational process (2010) Teaching and Learning in Nursing, 5, pp. 33-38; Baker, C.R., Reflective learning: A teaching strategy for critical thinking (1996) Journal of Nursing Education, 35 (1), pp. 19-22; Benner, P., Sutphen, M., Leonard, V., Day, L., (2009) Educating Nurses:A call for Radical Transformation, , San Francisco: Jossey- Bass; Boyd, E., Fales, A., Reflective learning: Key to learning from experience (1983) Journal of Human Psychology, 23, pp. 99-117; Bratt, M.M., (1998) Reflective Journaling: Fostering Learning in clinical Experiences, 20 (2), pp. 1-2. , Dean's Notes; Brookfield, S.D., (1995) Becoming a Critically Reflective Teacher, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; Burns, S., Bulman, C., (2000) Reflective Practice in Nursing, , Oxford: Blackwell Science; Carper, B.A., Fundamental patterns of knowing in nursing (1978) Advances in Nursing Science, 1 (1), pp. 13-24; Charon, R., Narrative medicine (2001) Journal of the American Medical Association, 286, pp. 1897-1902; Craft, M., Reflective writing and nursing education (2005) Journal of Nursing Education, 44 (2), pp. 53-57; Dickieson, P., Carter, L.M., Walsh, M., Integrative thinking and learning in undergraduate nursing education: Three strategies (2008) International Journal of Nursing Education Scholarship, 5 (1), pp. 1-15; Duffy, A., Guided reflection: A discussion of the essential components (2008) British Journal of Nursing, 17, pp. 334-339; Epp, S., The value of reflective journaling in undergraduate nursing education: A literature review (2008) International Journal of Nursing Studies, 45, pp. 1379-1388; Freire, P., (2007) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, , New York: Continuum; Hicks, F.D., Critical Thinking: Toward a Nursing Science Perspective (2001) Nursing Science Quarterly, 14 (1), pp. 14-21; Ireland, M., Assisting students to use evidence as a part of reflection on practice (2008) Nursing Education Perspectives, 29 (2), pp. 90-93; Ironside, P.M., New pedagogies for teaching thinking: The lived experiences of students and teachers enacting narrative pedagogy (2003) Journal of Nursing Education, 42 (11), pp. 509-516; Jarvis, P., Reflective practice and nursing (1992) Nurse Education Today, 12, pp. 174-181; Johns, C., Framing learning through reflection using Carper's fundamental ways of knowing in nursing (1995) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 22, pp. 226-234; Johns, C., (2004) Becoming a Reflective Practitioner (2nd ed.), , Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing; Kennison, M.M., (2000) Faculty and Student Perceptions of Reflection and Reflective Writing in a Nursing Curriculum, , Unpublished study.

We show that the shift from a private system of old-age support to public pensions increases the gross domestic product (GDP) per worker. Moreover, although in both cases the steady-state stock of capital, under myopic expectations, may be (globally) unstable depending on the size of the inter-generational transfer, we show that the existence of public pensions rather than private intra-family gifts considerably reduces the possibility of cyclical instability. © 2012 University of Venice.","Endogenous fertility; Myopic foresight; OLG model; Private old-age support; Public PAYG pensions",,,,,,"Azariadis, C., Drazen, A., Demographic transition in a dual economy (1991) UCLA Working Paper; Barro, R.J., Are government bonds net wealth?

In other words, world population could stand at nine billion. Knowing that even today 15% of the global population (a billion people) are underfed, we can see the scale of the challenge that lies before us when it comes to feeding the world. Jean-Louis Rastoin and Gerard Ghersi, fully conversant with the mechanisms of the global food system, offer to shed light on this challenge here with the aid of a foresight study on the global food system to 2050. They begin by outlining the tertiarized agro-industrial food system, which is tending to spread across the entire planet as a result of the mass consumption of increasingly similar products. It is a system based on a technical/economic model of intensive supply that is increasingly financialized, concentrated and globalized. Building on this observation and a certain number of key variables (demographic and economic growth, climate change, pressure on land etc.), Rastoin and Ghersi propose two contrasting scenarios for the period to 2050: the continuity scenario, in which the large-scale agro-industrial system intensifies, and the discontinuity scenario, which offers an alternative model based on a locally-sourced food system. They examine these two scenarios in terms of four sustainable development criteria (economic performance, ecological conservation, social fairness and participatory governance) and put rough figures to the two scenarios, from which it emerges that both can satisfy world food needs over the period under review. The difference relates, among other things, to the respect for sustainable development criteria, global food diversity etc., which are not promoted to any great degree in the currently prevalent scenario. However, if the alternative scenario is to become reality, it will be necessary to mobilize all the stakeholders, beginning with the public authorities, to ""devise and promote an appropriate food policy that does not currently exist in any country in the world."".",,,,,,,"Ventour, L., (2008) The Food We Waste: Food Waste Report, , Banbury: Waste and Resources Action Programme WRAP; Godet, M., (2001) Manuel de Prospective Stratégique, , Paris: Dunod; De Jouvenei, H., (2004) Invitation à la Prospective/An Invitation to Foresight, , Paris: Futuribles, coll.

Based on bio-responses of blood shear stress, which was not considered in Chinese medicine, we have initiated the merging of biomechanics with pharmacology and Chinese medicine, establishing the new discipline-biomechanopharmacology. Practice of exercise is a simple and self-regulatory way to promote shear stress in the circulation. Interestingly, acupuncture and massage are also linked with shear stress regulation.

In a previously published paper [Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 31 (2007), 1633-1671], we showed that by means of certain mathematical methods and results known as inverse limits theory it is possible to establish a correspondence between the backward dynamics of a noninvertible map and the forward dynamics of a related invertible map acting on an appropriately defined space of sequences, each of whose elements corresponds to an intertemporal equilibrium. We also proved the existence of different types of topological attractors for one-dimensional models of overlapping generations. In this paper, we provide an extension of those results, constructing a Lebesgue-like probability measure on spaces of infinite sequences that allows us to distinguish typical from exceptional dynamical behaviors in a measure-theoretical sense, thus proving that all the topological attractors considered in MR07 are also metric attractors. We incidentally also prove that the existence of chaos (in the Devaney-Touhey sense) backward in time implies (and is implied by) chaos forward in time. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.","Attractors; Backward Dynamics; Inverse Limits; Lebesgue-Like Measure; Overlapping Generations",,,,,,"Avila, A., Lyubich, M., De Melo, W., Regular or stochastic dynamics in real analytic families of unimodal maps (2004) Annals of Mathematics, 156, pp. 1-78; Avila, A., Moreira, C.G., Phase-parameter relation and sharp statistical properties for general families of unimodal map (2005) Contemporary Mathematics, 389, pp. 1-42; Avila, A., Moreira, C.G., Statistical properties of unimodal maps: Physical measures, periodic orbits and pathological laminations (2005) Publications Mathematiques de l'Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques, 101 (1), pp. 1-67. , DOI 10.1007/s10240-005-0033-2; Banks, J., Brooks, J., Cairns, G., Davis, G., Stacey, P., On Devaney's definition of chaos (1992) American Mathematical Monthly, 99 (4), pp. 332-334; Barge, M., Diamond, B., The dynamics of continuous maps of finite graphs through inverse limits (1994) Transactions of the, 344 (2), pp. 773-790. , American Mathematical Society; Benhabib, J., Day, R., A characterization of erratic dynamics in the overlapping generations model (1982) Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 4, pp. 37-55; Boldrin, M., Woodford, M., Equilibrium models displaying endogenous fluctuations and chaos: A survey (1990) Journal of Monetary Economics, 25 (2), pp. 189-222; Devaney, R.L., (2003) An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems, , 2nd ed.

The compensation scheme for electricity generated from biogas and biomethane, previously based on a fixed feed-in tariff, will henceforth be supplemented by an alternative direct marketing option, which consists of market-based and flexibility premiums. In this article two possible business models for the direct marketing of electricity from biogas and biomethane are economically compared to two state of the art business models based on fixed feed-in tariffs. A linear optimization model taking into account economic and technical restrictions is developed and applied to the two business models based on direct-marketing, in order to compare the costs and revenues for these two models to state of the art biogas plants generating base-load electricity. The key findings are that by applying direct marketing, additional income can be generated that more than compensates for the necessary additional investments. The results also show that the income from direct marketing of electricity generated from biogas mainly consists of the market and flexibility premium and the revenues generated on the spot exchange are of minor importance. Hence the direct marketing of electricity from biogas and biomethane remains heavily dependent on subsidies. The fact that the developed model assumes perfect foresight regarding the development of market prices means that the determined additional incomes represent an upper limit. © 2012 Springer Verlag.","Biogas; Biomethane; Business models; Demand-oriented electricity generation; Optimization",,,,,,"(2011) BHKW-Kenndaten 2011, , ASUE, Berlin: Arbeitsgemeinschaft für sparsamen und umweltfreundlichen Energieverbrauch e.V; (2011) Leitfaden: Bilanzierung Biogas, , BDEW/VKU/GEODE, Berlin: BDEW - Bundesverband der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V.; Verband kommunaler Unternehmen e.V.

This month's article in that series is a presentation of the lessons learned from the work of the study group on territories that have a residential and tourism-related economic base. Magali Talandier begins by outlining the importance of the residential economy for the local development of territories. She looks at the question at the heart of this working group's thinking: ""what future is there for the processes of residential and tourist development that are based on the capture of wealth created elsewhere, by virtue of the disconnect between sites of production and sites of consumption?"" Four possible answers have been identified, corresponding to the four scenarios outlined here: ""Oases, Urban Domes, Rural Domes"" (the scenario involving rootedness in the territory and reduced mobility, against a background of a service-oriented economy); ""Spheres of Life or Functional Specialization"" (the scenario of the local residential economy in which individuals move from one functional sphere to another with a cautious mobility, but an extension of peri-urban spaces); ""Spots or Network Mobility"" (combining mobility, fluidity and functional multiplicity of places, against a background of hypermobility and the loss of territorial cohesion); and, lastly, the ""Web"" or ""A-territorialization"" scenario (reduced movement, with multiple, but essentially virtual relationships to places) that marks the end of the residential economy and presents serious risks for social cohesion. Lastly, Magali Talandier details the contribution made by this group's work on two major issues for DATAR: the quality of territories for a mobile society and the organization of networks and time.",,,,,,,"Pecqueur, B., Talandier, M., Les Espaces de Développement Résidentiel et Touristique.

As the new academic year begins, we take this thinking forward-thanks to this article by Alain Bouvier-through a foresight study on school systems in the main developed countries up to 2030. Bouvier begins by reminding us of the main external impacts faced by the education system, impacts leading to its destabilization: the deep economic crisis affecting European countries (including France) over decades and disrupting the systematic relationship between the education system and employment; the quality requirements imposed on that system; the persistence of illiteracy; a strong demand for fairness; an enforced change in the occupational model; the impact of digital technology; the blurring of traditional divisions (particularly between public and private); market competition (private agencies, websites, coaching) etc. In such a context and given a time-horizon of eighteen years (2030), various scenarios are possible. These are not mutually exclusive and range from a continuance of the status quo (""the bureaucratic school"") to the ""market system"" with a variety of options in-between: distance-learning; (educational, geographical or ethnic) community schools; hybrid schools (classroom- and distance-learning); operator-run schools or schools run by education professionals. We may conclude that we shall, in the future, have to link together the actions of the education system's different stakeholders (state, communities, partners, employers etc.) and accept a degree of outsourcing of learning, while insisting that this meet the aims of quality, fairness and ethical practice essential to pupils in the globalized, digital societies we inhabit.",,,,,,,"Prost, A., (1997) Éducation, Société et Politiques.

We investigate this question further and use a planning-to-exchange task to study future planning in the cooperative domain in two species of monkeys: the brown capuchin (Cebus apella) and the Tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana). The rationale required subjects to plan for a future opportunity to exchange tokens for food by collecting tokens several minutes in advance. Subjects who successfully planned for the exchange task were expected to select suitable tokens during a collection period (5/10 min), save them for a fixed period of time (20/30 min), then take them into an adjacent compartment and exchange them for food with an experimenter. Monkeys mostly failed to transport tokens when entering the testing compartment; hence, they do not seem able to plan for a future exchange with a human partner. Three subjects did however manage to solve the task several times, albeit at very low rates. They brought the correct version of three possible token types, but rarely transported more than one suitable token at a time. Given that the frequency of token manipulation predicted transport, success might have occurred by chance. This was not the case, however, since in most cases subjects were not already holding the token in their hands before they entered the testing compartment. Instead, these results may reflect subjects' strengths and weaknesses in their time-related comprehension of the task. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Anticipation; Foresight; Future planning; Future-oriented behaviour; Non-human primate; Token exchange","animal; anticipation; article; Cebus; comprehension; decision making; female; forecasting; learning; Macaca; male; psychological aspect; reinforcement; Animals; Anticipation, Psychological; Cebus; Choice Behavior; Comprehension; Female; Forecasting; Learning; Macaca; Male; Token Economy; Animalia; Cebus; Cebus apella; Haplorhini; Macaca; Macaca tonkeana; Primates",,,,,"Anderson, J.M., Hattori, Y., Fujita, K., Quality before quantity: rapid learning of reverse-reward contingency by capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) (2008) J Comp Psychol, 122, pp. 445-448. , doi:10.1037/a0012624; Bar, M., The continuum of ""looking forward"" and paradoxical requirements from memory (2007) Behav Brain Sci, 30, pp. 315-316. , doi:10.1017/S0140525X07002002; Barrett, L., Henzi, S.P., Weingrill, T., Lycett, J.E., Hill, R.A., Market forces predict grooming reciprocity in female baboons (1999) Proc R Soc Lond B, 266, pp. 665-670; Boesch, C., Boesch, H., Mental map in wild chimpanzees: an analysis of hammer transports for nut cracking (1984) Primates, 25, pp. 160-170; Brosnan, S.F., de Waal, F.B.M., Responses to a simple barter task in chimpanzees, (Pan troglodytes) (2005) Primates, 46, pp. 173-182; Clayton, N.S., Bussey, T.J., Dickinson, A., Can animals recall the past and plan for the future?

Hypoglycemia can be induced by several causes, including an aberrant increase of hypoglycemic agents and adrenal insufficiency. Sorafenib is the first agent to demonstrate a survival benefit in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This small molecule inhibits serine/threonine kinase RAF in tumor cells and tyrosine kinases VEGFR/PDGFR in tumor vasculature and decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis. In this paper, we report a case of HCC who was treated with sorafenib and showed severe hypoglycemia. This hypoglycemia might be induced by two causes, both adrenal insufficiency as an adverse effect of sorafenib and activation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signal by excessive secretion of incompletely processed precursors of IGF-II. Although the IGF signal is suggested to be involved in aberrant growth of HCC in some cases, there is no other report showing the influence of sorafenib on HCC with active IGF signal. Unfortunately, the effect of sorafenib was limited in the present case. However, emerging drugs that directly inhibit the IGF signal can be expected to be highly effective in the treatment of HCC with hypoglycemia. © 2012 S.

It focuses particularly on challenges that arise when dealing with novel conditions and the associated requirements of system evolvability, e.g. seamless reconfigurability to cope with changing production orders, robustness to failures and disturbances, and modifiable user-centric interfaces. Because novelty in manufacturing or the marketplace is only predictable to a limited degree, the flexible mechanisms that will permit a system to adequately respond to novelty cannot be entirely pre-specified. As a solution to this challenge, we propose how evolvability can become a pervasive property of the assembly system that, while constrained by the system's historical development and domain-specific requirements, can emerge and re-emerge without foresight or planning. We first describe an important mechanism by which biological systems can cope with uncertainty through properties described as degeneracy and networked buffering. We discuss what degeneracy means, how it supports a system facing unexpected challenges, and we review evidence from simulations using evolutionary algorithms that support some of our conjectures in models with similarities to several assembly system contexts. Finally, we discuss potential design strategies for encouraging emergent changeability in assembly systems. We also discuss practical challenges to the realization of these concepts within a systems engineering context, especially issues related to system transparency, design costs, and efficiency. We discuss how some of these difficulties can be overcome while also elaborating on those factors that are likely to limit the applicability of these principles. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Agile manufacturing; Assembly systems; Complexity; Degeneracy; Evolvability; Multi-agent systems; Networked buffering; Robotics","Agile manufacturing; Assembly systems; Complexity; Degeneracy; Evolvability; Multi agent system (MAS); Networked buffering; Assembly; Computer simulation; Customer satisfaction; Design; Multi agent systems; Riveting; Robotics; Agile manufacturing systems; computer aided design; computer interface; computer model; computer network; computer simulation; computer system; conference paper; cost; evolutionary algorithm; manufacturing system; physical parameters; robotics",,,,,"Al-Safi, Y., Vyatkin, V., Ontology-based reconfiguration agent for intelligent mechatronic systems in flexible manufacturing (2010) Robot Comput Integr Manuf, 26 (4), pp. 381-391; Ashby, W., (1956) An Introduction to Cybernetics, , Chapman & Hall, London; Banzhaf, W., Genotype-phenotype-mapping and neutral variation-A case study in genetic programming (1994) Parallel Problem Solving from Nature III, 866, pp. 322-332. , Springer, Berlin; Barata, J., (2005) Coalition Based Approach for Shopfloor Agility; Orion, E., Amadora Barata, J., Camarinha-Matos, L., Onori, M., A multiagent based control approach for evolvable assembly systems (2005) 3rd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN), pp. 478-483. , Perth, Australia; Berry, G., Boudol, G., The chemical abstract machine (1998) Theoret Comput Sci, 96 (1), pp. 217-248; Brueckner, S., (2000) Return from the Ant-synthetic Ecosystems for Manufacturing Control, , PhD thesis, Institute of Computer Science.

It was contended that risk aversion triggered by a positive frame of the reward variant and risk seeking triggered by a negative frame of the punishment variant appears as long-term decision making in the two IGT variants. Apart from the frame of the variant as a within-subjects factor (variant type: reward and punishment), the order in which the frame was triggered (order type: reward-punishment or punishment-reward), and the four types of instructions that delineated motivation toward reward from that of punishment (reward, punishment, reward and punishment, and nohint) were hypothesized to have an effect on foresighted decision making in the IGT. As expected, long-term decision making differed across the two IGT variants suggesting that the frame of the variant has an effect on long-term decision making in the IGT (p <0.001). The order in which a variant was presented, and the type of the instructions that were used both had an effect on long-term decision making in the two IGT variants (p <0.05). A post hoc test suggested that the instructions that differentiated between reward and punishment resulted in greater foresight than the commonly used IGT instructions that fail to distinguish between reward and punishment. As observed in previous studies, there were more number of participants (60%) who showed greater foresight in the punishment variant than in the reward variant (p <0.001). The results suggest that foresight in IGT decision making is sensitive to reward and punishment frame in an asymmetric manner, an observation that is aligned with the behavioral decision making framework. Benefits of integrating findings from behavioral studies in decision neuroscience are discussed, and a need to investigate cultural differences in the IGT studies is pointed out.© 2012 SinghandKhan.","Decision making; Framing effect; Instructions; Iowa gambling task; Reward-punishment","adult; article; aversive behavior; decision making; female; human; human experiment; male; motivation; normal human; post hoc analysis; punishment; reward; United States",,,,,"Ainslie, G., Specious reward: a behavioral theory of impulsiveness and impulse control (1975) Psychol.

Previous work has established that more information about the price development does not guarantee higher performance. In particular, traders with limited information perform below market average and are outperformed by random traders; only insiders beat the market. However, this result has only been shown in markets with a few traders and a uniform distribution over information levels. We present additional simulations of several more realistic information distributions, extending previous findings. In addition, we analyze the market dynamics with an evolutionary model of competing information levels. Results show that the highest information level will dominate if information comes for free. If information is costly, less-informed traders may prevail reflecting a more realistic distribution over information levels. © 2012 ACM.","evolutionary game theory; stock markets; value of information","Competitive advantage; Double auction; Evolutionary game theory; Evolutionary models; Information distributions; Limited information; Market dynamics; Price development; Price signals; Stock market; Uniform distribution; Value of information; Competition; Game theory; Commerce",,,,,"Angel, J.J., (2002) Market Mechanics: A Guide to U.S. Stock Markets, , Technical report, The Nasdaq Stock Market Educational Foundation, Inc; Bajari, P., Hortacsu, A., The winner's curse, reserve prices, and endogenous entry: Empirical insights from ebay auctions (2003) RAND Journal of Economics, pp. 329-355; Barrot, C., Albers, S., Skiera, B., Schäfers, B., Vickrey vs. ebay: Why second-price sealed-bid auctions lead to more realistic price-demand functions (2010) International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 14 (4), pp. 7-38; Cowles, A., Can stock market forecasters forecast?

Starting with Luigi Einaudi, who took up the heritage of Carlo Cattaneo, it has continued with Giovanni Malagodi, Giovanni Demaria, and Bruno Leoni, not to mention the liberals of Einaudi's times. The same reflection continues today. Alberto Alesina is a prominent personality among the scholars who can be considered as full heirs of Einaudi. A foresight, often impressive, is the thread linking Einaudi's writings on European federation. Between the twenties and the early fifties of the 20th century, Einaudi traced with great precision the profile and many details of a politically and economically unified Europe. Today, we do not have the federation that he wished for, but the economic sovereignty among EU countries has been shared to a great extent. Other prominent Italian liberal thinkers and politicians have reflected on the idea of a federal Europe and on the incipient European construction: thinkers such as Bruno Leoni, Giovanni Malagodi and Giovanni Demaria. Giovanni Malagodi, for many years a member of the Italian Parliament and secretary general of the Italian Liberal party, in his speech for the ratification of the Treaty of Rome, advocated a European monetary union with a single currency substituting those of the Member States of the EEC. Both Giovanni Demaria and Bruno Leoni warned against the danger of Government interventionist policies in the European common market. Alesina, in various scholarly contributions on European integration and in the essay The Future of Europe, adopts a liberal perspective for his critical analysis of EU policies. © 2012 International Atlantic Economic Society.","Alesina; Demaria; Einaudi; Leoni; Malagodi",,,,,,"Alesina, A., Giavazzi, F., (2006) The future of Europe: Reform or Decline, , MIT Press; dei Deputati, C., Sommario, R., delle Commissioni, B., (1957), 10 July 1957; dei Deputati, C., (1957) Atti Parlamentari, , session of 20 July 1957; http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese_01.pdf, Constitution of the Italian Republic, Rome, December 1947.

Following a review of arguments for foresight as genetically inherited versus environmentally acquired, the understanding of foresight is expanded through a behaviorist perspective and through an evolutionary perspective. The framework established makes it possible to deploy evolutionary logic to explain foresight as well as to enhance our understanding of foresight, both on individual (e.g., managerial) and aggregated (e.g., organizational) levels. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Behavior;

It carefully aims to re-examine the notion of environmental uncertainty, the main theoretical approaches advanced by literature on strategy to cope with uncertainty, and foresight activities in corporate organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This article is theoretical in nature. However, its insights are significantly based on empirical analysis: the author has been involved in the past ten years in in-depth investigation of foresight practices in several international firms of different industries. Findings: Several important issues and research questions on strategic foresight have remained largely unresolved from both an academic and managerial perspective. This paper outlines such questions. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it links the work on strategic foresight to a wide range of related literature streams, thus revealing new connections and issues to be explored. Second, it develops a research agenda that may inspire further theoretical and empirical work on the nature and effects of strategic foresight efforts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental uncertainty; Forward planning; Learning; Planning; Strategic foresight; Strategic management; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Alsan, A., Oner, M.A., An integrated view of foresight: Integrated foresight management model (2003) Foresight, 5 (2), pp. 33-45; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Ansoff, H.I., Critique of Henry Mintzberg's 'The design school': Reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12 (6), pp. 449-461; Becker, P., (2002) Corporate Foresight in Europe: A First Overview, RTK2 Scientific and Technological Foresight, , European Commission, Brussels; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., van der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Bradley MacKay, R., Costanzo, L.A., Introduction (2009) Handbook of Research on Strategic Foresight, pp. 1-12. , Bradley MacKay, R., Costanzo, L.A.

The measure is also associated as a dimension of foresight as a leadership competence. This study seeks to determine the validity and reliability of the revised FSA as proposed by Gary. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative two-step methodology was adopted as a pilot study preceding the main study in which a web-based survey methodology was used. The sample consisted of 298 strategy level leaders. Data were analysed using advanced statistical analysis techniques including factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The FSA's four factors; tester, adapter, framer and reactor, were confirmed but did not display uni-dimensionality. Analytical results confirmed the validity and reliability of the measure, and the structural equation model illustrated good model fit. The reactor factor was determined to be a method factor and theoretical concerns could be raised regarding whether the reactor factor describes a foresight style. Future research of a summated three-factor scale (excluding the reactor factor) is suggested and should include strategy-level leaders, especially in more diverse populations, investigating further, the nomological validity and reliability of the scale. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the purposive non-probability sampling technique the sample results are not generalisable. However, the statistical results are rigorous and significant in terms of determining the validity and reliability of the measure. Further research of a summated three-factor (tester, framer, adapter) scale amongst a more diverse population is suggested. Practical implications: While some notable studies have been conducted, futures studies research generally lacks validated and reliable quantitative measures related to the foresight construct. As suggested by Inayatullah, the importance of understanding the value free observations of the empirically observable is required to meaningfully conduct deeper analysis of social issues. The findings of this research has implications in the study of foresight by providing empirical grounds for further exploratory research, and providing rigorous evidence supporting the use of the foresight styles assessment especially as a three-factor summated scale. Use of the scale is not limited to foresight studies, indeed it can and has been applied to broader leadership cognition and strategic management studies yet to be reported. Social implications: Considering that foresight is regarded as an innate human characteristic and the need for social foresight may never have been higher, understanding a basis of measuring the construct may have significant implications in terms of further social science research and social foresight development. Originality/value: In terms of measuring a broader construct of foresight competence, the rigorous validation of a measure to enable further interpretive, exploratory and critical research is important. To the author's knowledge, using structural equation modelling techniques in futures studies is very rare if at all. The study further contributes to the development of a rigorous measure that may facilitate significant foresight/futures studies/leadership and management future research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Emergent strategy; Foresight competence; Foresight styles assessment; Forward planning; Leaders; Strategy level leaders; Structural equation modelling",,,,,,"Amsteus, M., Managerial foresight: Concept and measurement (2008) Foresight, 10 (1), pp. 53-66; Boal, K.B., Hooijberg, R., Strategic leadership research: Moving on (2000) The Leadership Quarterly, 11 (4), pp. 515-549; Boyatzis, R.E., Competencies in the 21st century (2008) Journal of Management Development, 27 (1), pp. 5-12; Boyatzis, R.E., Saatcioglu, A., A 20-year view of trying to develop emotional, social and cognitive intelligence competencies in graduate management education (2008) Journal of Management Development, 27 (1), pp. 92-108; Cannella Jr., A.A., Monroe, M.J., Contrasting perspectives on strategic leaders: Toward a more realistic view of top managers (1997) Journal of Management, 23 (3), p. 213; Carpenter, M.A., Geletkanycz, M.A., Sanders, W.G., Upper echelons research revisited: Antecedents, elements, and consequences of top management team composition (2004) Journal of Management, 30 (6), pp. 749-778; Collis, D.J., Montgomery, C.A., Competing on resources: Strategy in the 1990s (1999) Knowledge and Strategy, , Zack, M.H.

Design/methodology/approach: This is not an analysis of the particular content of the next 500 or 1,000 years but a comparative analysis of methodologies and epistemological approaches best utilized in long-range foresight work. It involves an analysis of multiple methods to understand long-range foresight; literature review; and critical theory. Findings: Methodologies that forecast the long-term future are likely to be more rewarding - in terms of quality, insight, and validity - if they are eclectic and layered, go back in time as far as they go in the future, that contextualize critical factors and long-term projections through a nuanced reading of macrohistory, and focus on epistemic change, the ruptures that reorder how we know the world. Research limitations/implications: The article provides frameworks to study the long-range future. It gives advice on how best to design research projects that are focused on the long-term. Limitations include: no quantitative studies were used and the approach while epistemologically sensitive remains bounded by Western frameworks of knowledge. Practical implications: The article provides methodological and epistemological guidance as to the best methods for long range foresight. It overviews strengths and weaknesses of various approaches. Originality/value: This is the only research project to analyze methodological aspects of 500-1,000 year forecasting. It includes conventional technocratic views of the future as well as Indic and feminist perspectives. It is among the few studies to link macrohistory and epistemic analysis to study the long-term. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Causal layered analysis; Forecasting; Forward planning; Long-range foresight; Macrohistory; Pitirim Sorokin's pendulum; Post-structuralism; Sarkar's social cycle",,,,,,"Human species may split in two (2006), http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6057734.stm, BBC News, available at: (accessed 16 January 2012); Easton, N., Fortune's guide to the future (2012) Fortune, p. 30. , 16 January; Eisler, R., (1996) Sacred Pleasure, , HarperCollins, San Francisco, CA; (2005) Humanity 3000: 2005 Symposium Proceedings, , Foundation for the Future, Foundation for the Future, Bellevue, WA; Fowles, J., The future of the internet: Forecasting by analogy (1996) Futures Research Quarterly, 15 (3); Galtung, J., Inayatullah, S., (1997) Macrohistory and Macrohistorians, , (Eds.), Praeger, Westport, CT; Glenn, J., Millennium project's draft scenarios for the next 1000 years (2000) Futures, 32 (6), pp. 603-612; Hartcher, P., Internet is another 'boom and bust' speculative (1999) Australian Financial Review, , 13-14 February; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Hiltunen, E., Crowdsourcing the future (2011) Journal of Futures Studies, 16 (1), pp. 189-196; Inayatullah, S., (2004) The Causal Layered Analysis Reader, , (Ed.), Tamkang University, Tamsui; Inayatullah, S., Obiojifor, L., Ihsan, S., The futures of communication (1995) Futures, 27 (8), pp. 897-904; Kaku, M., (1998) Visions: How Science Will Revolutionize the 21st Century and Beyond, , Oxford University Press; Kaplan, M.A., Selle, R., The emergence of a global society (1998) World and I, 13 (9), p. 18; Kardashev, N., Transmission of information by extraterrestrial civilizations (1964) Soviet Astronomy, A7 (8), pp. 217-221; Lacey, R., Danziger, D., (1999) The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium, , Little Brown and Company, London; Laszlo, E., (2004) Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything, , Inner Traditions International, Rochester, VT; Loye, D., (2004) The Great Adventure: Toward a Fully Human Theory of Evolution, , (Ed.), SUNY, New York, NY; Molitor, G., Millennial perspectives: Strengths and limitations of long-term forecasts (1998), Vital Speeches of the Day, 15 August, pp. 661-5; Polak, F., (1973) The Image of the Future, , Trans.

After summarising their main points it seeks to consider different approaches to ""sense making"" in the work of future-relevant theorists and practitioners; then to consider the case of sense making through integral approaches and then to explore implications through several themes. These include: a view of changes in the global system, generic responses to the global emergency, the critique of regressive modernity and how responses to ""Cassandra's dilemma"" (to know the future but not be believed) might stand in relation to the views of both authors. The paper aims to conclude with a view of the benefits to be obtained from the use of a four-quadrant approach to understanding and responding to the human predicament. Design/methodology/approach: This is a discussion paper that questions some of the views and assumptions of the earlier papers and explores some implications of an alternative view. Findings: While supporting the drive to improve upon the theoretical foundations of futures studies and foresight, the paper questions whether such developments are as central, or will be as influential, as the authors suggest. A different view of ""how to approach the future"" is recommended, in part through four ""domains of generic responses"" to the global predicament. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents an argument supported by evidence. Both should be reviewed by others in pursuit of extending the conversation beyond philosophical questions to implications in practice. Practical implications: The essence of a methodology to understand, approach and even to resolve many aspects of the global emergency is outlined here. As such the paper has many practical implications for the way that futures and foresight professionals operate and towards what ends. Social implications: The paper provides a substantive basis for qualified hope and engagement with a range of future-shaping tasks. Specifically, these relate to the necessary shifts from ""overshoot and collapse"" trajectories to options for ""moderated descent"". Originality/value: Much of the work carried out on the perspective and issues discussed here has been carried out by those working outside of the futures/foresight domain. The value is both in affirming positive ways forward and extending the professional reach of futures/foresight workers to embrace new ideas and methods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Critique; Forecasting; Forward planning; Generic responses; Global emergency; Global system; Human development; Regressive modernity; Sense making",,,,,,"Adam, B., Cultural future matters: An exploration in the spirit of Max Weber's methodological writings (2009) Time and Society, 18 (7), pp. 7-25; AtKisson, A., (1999) Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at Today's World, , Scribe, Melbourne; Bell, W., (1997) The Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, Knowledge, 1. , Transaction Publishers, Piscataway, NY, 3rd ed; Bergson, H., (1946) The Creative Mind, , The Greenwood Press, New York, NY; de Jouvenel, B., (1967) The Art of Conjecture, , Weidenfeld & Nicholson, London; Hamilton, C., (2010) Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth About Climate Change, , Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest; Hanson, J., (2009) Storms of My Grandchildren, , Bloomsbury, New York, NY; Hulme, M., (2009) Why We Disagree about Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press; Kemph, H., (2008) How the Rich Are Destroying the Earth, , Finch Publishing, Sydney; Klare, M., (2012) The Race for What's Left: The Global Scramble for the World's Last Resources, , Metropolitan Books, New York, NY; Manne, R., What is Rudd's agenda?

Some arguments borrowed from the doctrine of double effect provide the conceptual context for justifying that instrumental and incidental harm must receive different punishment. However, such a distinction has been fiercely criticized in contemporary moral philosophy. For this reason, in order to defend the doctrine of double effect, this paper underlines not only the moral relevance of the distinction between intention and foresight, but it also claims that instrumental harm - unlike the incidental harm - counts as an intended one.","Dolus; Incidental harm; Instrumental harm; Intentional action; Practical necessity",,,,,,"Cavanaugh, T., (2006) Double Effect Reasoning.

The striatum, particularly the ventral striatum (= the nucleus accumbens) is deeply involved in the acquisition and expression of addiction. Although only few pharmacotherapeutic approaches against addiction are available, the currently used animal models of addiction are sophisticated enough to mimic most of the representative phenotypes observed in human addicts. In addition, recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as computational neuroscience approaches have promoted our understanding of addiction, particularly at the circuitry level. In this review, I introduce some pivotal topics regarding addiction for discussion. First, I outline the updated concept regarding how dopamine is involved in addiction by focusing on 2 seemingly uncompromising hypotheses, prediction-error theory and incentive salience theory. Second, after providing a brief introduction to unmanageable maladaptive behaviors in addiction that may be attributable to the impairments of the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex, I emphasize the roles of glutamatergic inputs projecting from these frontal areas to the nucleus accumbens in cue-primed reinstatement of drug-seeking and impaired neuronal plasticity. Third, on the basis of the complementary or counterbalancing relationship between goal-directed behaviors and habits, I discuss the foresights and pitfalls of the current concept of ""addiction as a pathological habit."" Lastly, I conclude my discussion with an integrated (but a rough) circuitry model of addiction.","Addiction; Decision-making; Dopamine; Glutamate; Striatum","dopamine; addiction; article; disease model; drug seeking behavior; frontal lobe; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; hypothesis; nerve cell plasticity; neuroimaging; neuroscience; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; pathophysiology; phenotype; pleasure; positron emission tomography; prediction; self monitoring; Animals; Behavior, Addictive; Corpus Striatum; Decision Making; Dopamine; Drug-Seeking Behavior; Glutamine; Humans",,"dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; Glutamine, 56-85-9",,,"Childress, A.R., Ehrman, R.N., Wang, Z., Li, Y., Sciortino, N., Prelude to passion: Limbic activation by ""unseen"" drug and sexual cues (2008) PLoS ONE, 3, pp. e1506; Robinson, T.E., Addicted rats (2004) Science, 305, pp. 951-953; Schultz, W., Behavioral theories and the neurophysiology of reward (2006) Annu Rev Psychol, 57, pp. 87-115; Phillips, P.E., Stuber, G.D., Heien, M.L., Wightman, R.M., Carelli, R.M., Subsecond dopamine release promotes cocaine seeking (2003) Nature, 422, pp. 614-618; Salamone, J.D., Functions of mesolimbic dopamine: Changing concepts and shifting paradigms (2007) Psychopharmacology, 191, p. 389. , Berl; Berridge, K.C., Robinson, T.E., What is the role of dopamine in reward: Hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience?

Consciousness is also seen as interwoven in socio-cultural contexts. We will discuss facets of this continuum and relate them to ontogenetic and phylogenetic states of individuals. This will be done by pointing out parallels between the development of memory systems and the development of the self in human beings, and by showing that most animal species lack insight and foresight and the capacity to travel back and forth in time; and that as a consequence of these incapacities animals stand on a lower level of consciousness. Furthermore, it will be shown that in human beings the development of language and theory of mind functions contributes to the establishment of a conscious mind. The social and cultural context has to be added as mechanisms that contribute and manifest the ability to consciously reflect on the environment. Both an insufficient ontogenetic development and disturbed brain functions in later life may be lead to disturbances of consciousness. This will be discussed with respect to a number of neurological and psychiatric disease conditions. On the neurological site, damage to specific core regions in the brain, but also of more widespread networks (""default mode networks"") may impair consciousness significantly. On the psychiatric level, there are so to say standard illnesses such as schizophrenia which cloud conscious reflection. Of higher interest are, however, more rare disease conditions as dissociative (psychogenic) amnesias which frequently lead to identity disturbances or a complete loss of identity and therefore to a change in consciousness which is radically different from that which occurs as a consequence of drug or alcohol abuse, or after degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. States and mechanisms of consciousness consequently will be discussed within this spectrum of pathological conditions and processes with the aim to provide an integrated framework of attributes necessary for autonoetic - self-reflected - consciousness. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The purpose of this study is to construct an improved planning model for new products based on the theoretical structures of technology roadmaps and patent analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes the perspective of a product planning strategy, using technology roadmap developed by Institute of Manufacturing Technology of the University of Cambridge, combining with scenario planning and patent analysis. The main body of the proposed model is the technology roadmap of the product. Through patent analysis, the technology roadmap was integrated into the hierarchical execution of product planning to improve the disadvantages of the original technology roadmap and thereby clarify the content of the implemented procedure. With the planning of digital home products in a large household appliance manufacturer in China as a case study, the feasibility of the proposed model was verified. Findings: The improved planning model for new products comprised five planning phases: market scenario planning, product feature analysis, technological development analysis, patent combination analysis, and resource allocation. A matrix corresponding to product planning was established. The case study is to find out the developing trends in next-generation product features in six different scenarios of digital home for M, a home appliance manufacturer. There are five steps of the product planning model. The product planning model provides enterprises with integrated information from market demand, technology as well as patents. At the same time, it is easy to maintain and reproduce. The authors expect the model to make a contribution to practical product planning. Originality/value: This model should become an essential prediction tool for enterprises developing new products and can assist in decision-making and strategic implementation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Digital home; Household appliance manufacturer; New product development; New product planning; Patent analysis; Product development; Product planning; Scenario analysis; Technology roadmap",,,,,,"(2001) Planning for Business Competitiveness: A Guide to Developing Competitiveness, , Australian Government of Department of Industry, Science and Resources Technology, Occasional Paper No. 13, Emerging Industries Section, Department of Industry, Canberra; Balachandra, R., Friar, J.H., Factors for success in R&D projects and new product innovation: A contextual framework (1997) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 44 (3), pp. 276-287; (1982) New Product Management for the 1980s, p. 17. , Booz, Allen and Hamilton, Booz, Allen and Hamilton, New York, NY; Cooper, R.G., Doing it right - winning with new products (2000) Ivey Business Journal, , July/August; Cooper, R.G., Kleinschmidt, E.J., Resources allocation in the new product development process (1998) Industrial Marketing Management, 17, pp. 249-262; Cooper, R.G., Edgett, S.J., Kleinschmidt, E.J., Optimizing the stage-gate process: What best-practice companies do - I (2002) Research Technology Management, 45 (5), pp. 21-27; Hollins, B., Stuart, P., (1990) Success Product Design, pp. 3-16. , Butterworth, London; Imaz, M., Benyon, D.R., How stories capture interactions (1999) Proceedings of Interact'99, , Johnson, C., Sasse, A.

In the Foresight 2020 survey, knowledge management (KM) is believed to offer the greatest potential for productivity gains over the next decade. However, in practice many organizations do not receive satisfactory value from implementing KM. The primary reason of low return on KM investment is due to reuse problems. We propose an agent-based model to assessing knowledge reuse processes in an organization. By modeling major components in knowledge reuse processes as agents, we provide a way to analyze the interactions and relationships among these individuals, and their impact on the value in organizational knowledge reuse.

More precisely, based on the knowledge of actual production of the competitor and its actual rate of change, the clever firm is able to evaluate its opponent's output in the near future by virtue of straightforward extrapolative foresight. We finally arrive at a conclusion that this seemingly rational mechanism takes a positive effect on convergence to equilibrium behavior. Inconsistent with common intuition, we demonstrate that stronger foresight ability is not always better to stabilize the equilibrium. Particularly, perfect foresight dose not give rise to the best stabilizing factor. © 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The main method applied is critical thinking combined with a review of selected aspects of complexity theory and a general experience of applying foresight. Several new and practical implications for foresight techniques and their application are derived. Promoting variation is examined as one way to make policies more resilient in a complex system. Findings - Complexity science demonstrates that disruptive events do not need an associated trigger, as they are a normal part of a complex system. This insight implies that if we are always looking for weak signals we will certainly be caught unawares. Practical implications - The assumption that disruptive events can be managed by planning and forecasting is not a workable option. Instead, policy making needs to assume that unexpected disruptive events will happen even with the best horizon scanning system in place. Foresight techniques need to be developed to embrace emergence and to provide capabilities such as reframing to visualise systems from very different perspectives, including those considered impossible now. Originality/value - Although neither complexity theory nor the concept of reframing is new in the area of foresight, the derivation of practical implications for foresight techniques is original. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complexity; Complexity theory; Disruptive events; Emergence; Policy making; Reframing; Strategic planning; Uncertainty management; Variation",,,,,,"Axelrod, R., (1985) The Evolution of Cooperation, , Basic Books, New York, NY, reprinted ed; Axelrod, R., Cohen, M., (2001) Harnessing Complexity: Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier, , The Free Press, New York, NY; Battram, A., (2000) Navigating Complexity: The Essential Guide to Complexity Theory in Business and Management, , Spiro Press, London; Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, Volume 1: Human Science for a New Era, , Transaction Publishers, Piscataway, NJ; Bhimji, W., (2009) Guidance on the Use of Strategic Foresight Analysis for Policy Development in Government, , www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/horizon-scanning-centre/futuresinpolicyguidance.pdf, available at (accessed 6 June 2012), UK Government Office for Science, London; Byrne, D., (1998) Complexity Theory and the Social Sciences: An Introduction, , Routledge, New York, NY; Gheorghiou, L., Cassingena Harper, J., Keenan, M., Miles, I., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, pp. 3-23. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Glouberman, S., Zimmerman, B., (2002) Complicated and Complex Systems: What Would Successful Reform of Medicare Look Like?, , Commission on the Future of Healthcare in Canada, Ottawa; Goodwin, B., (1994) How the Leopard Changed Its Spots, , Phoenix, London; Inayatullah, S., Deconstructing and reconstructing the future: Predictive, cultural and critical epistemologies (1990) Futures, 22 (2), pp. 115-141; Mendonça, S., Pine Cunha, M., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 201-218; Mikulecky, C., The emergence of complexity: Science coming of age or science growing old?

Additionally, it suggests ways to reinforce the scenario design method with more in-depth analysis, without losing its qualitative nature and communication advantages. Design/methodology/approach - These assumptions are tested in a scenario design exercise that explores the future evolution of the sustainable development paradigm and its implications in the Spanish urban development model. Findings - Major findings are obtained on the feasibility of a systematic approach that provides anticipatory intelligence about future disruptive events that may affect the natural environment and the socioeconomic fabric of a given territory. In addition, the study confirms that foresight offers interesting opportunities for urban planners, such as anticipating changes, fostering participation and building networks, in contrast to its perception as a mere story-telling technique that generates oversimplified visions without the backing of rigorous analysis. Research limitations/implications - In order to boost the perception of scenario design as an added value instrument for urban planners, three sets of implications - functional, parametric and spatial - are displayed to provide substantial information for policy makers. Originality/value - The value of the present work lies in the synergy that can be generated between territorial foresight and urban planning, offering a great opportunity for policy makers to use futurists' output as input for urban planners' work. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forecasting; Scenario design; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Territorial foresight; Urban planning",,,,,,"(2009) Estudio de prospectiva territorial para la Ciudad de Burgos, , Asociación Plan Estratégico de Burgos Burgos Asociación Plan Estratégico de unpublished study; Cole, S., Dare to dream: Bringing futures into planning (2001) American Planning Association Journal, 67 (4), pp. 372-383; de Terán, F., Evolución del planeamiento urbanístico (1846-1996) (1996) Ciudad Y Territorio - Estudios Territoriales, (107-108), pp. 167-184; (2011) Foresight brief 'Knowledge Sharing Platform, , www.foresightplatform.eu, available at (accessed 14 July 2011) European Foresight Platform; (2007) Scenarios on the Territorial Future of Europe, , ESPON, Belgium European Spatial Planning Observation Network; Fernández Güell, J.M., (2006) Planificación estratégica De Ciudades: Nuevos Instrumentos Y Procesos, , Editorial Reverté, Barcelona; Fernández Güell, J.M., Recuperación de los estudios del futuro a través de la prospectiva territorial (2011) Ciudad Y Territorio - Estudios Territoriales, (167), pp. 11-32; Fernández Güell, J.M., (2007) Sostenibilidad de las periferias metropolitanas de la Comunidad de Madrid, , research project, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid; Fernández Güell, J.M., (2009) Oportunidad y viabilidad de la prospectiva en el planeamiento urbano y territorial, , research project in progress, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid; (2001) Practical Guide to Regional Foresight, , Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Sevilla Foresight for Regional Development Network; http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide, available at (accessed 16 September 2011), n.d Guide Forlearn Online; Fundación, O.P.T.I., (2007) Estudio De Prospectiva Sobre El Comportamiento Social Ante El Desarrollo Sostenible, , Fundación OPTI, Madrid; Gavigan, J.P., Scapolo, F., La prospectiva y la visión del desarrollo regional a largo plazo (2001) The IPTS Report, pp. 22-33; Godet, M., (1993) From Anticipation to Action - A Handbook of Strategic Prospective, , UNESCO, Paris; Hall, P., (1996) Cities of Tomorrow, , Blackwell, London, updated ed; Special Issue on foresight and regional development (2001) The IPTS Report No. 59, pp. 1-47. , Institute for Prospective Technological Studies; Isserman, A.M., Dare to plan: An essay on the role of the future in planning practice and education (1985) Town Planning Review, 56 (4), pp. 483-491; Kates, R.W., Parris, T.M., Leiserowitz, A.A., What is sustainable development?

As law traditionally reacts after events and is resistant to change and transformation, the article argues for equipping legal activities with a set of tools, methods and approaches that enables them to acknowledge and anticipate the various possible futures that will guide society. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes a series of real world examples and case studies - pilot projects, research consortia and academic programmes - that are already employing FTA methodological approaches to pursue their objectives. Findings: Based on these examples, the article explains the various benefits that the application of specific FTA methodological approaches (such as scenario-planning, modelling techniques and backcasting) may bring to three specific legal fields - legal research, legislative drafting and law enforcement. The article also examines the prospective perils that systematically applying FTA to law may bring about. While the introduction of FTA tools and techniques to law is deemed extremely important and useful, the paper also draws attention to the problems and challenges that this entails, indicating paths for future research. Originality/value - Future-oriented legal studies are rare and, what is worse, the ones that exist lack proper methodology, failing to encompass the use of forecasting methods or foresight tools in the development of their studies. This paper attempts to fill the gap produced by this notorious lack of methodology in the legal analysis of the future, and presents a new methodological approach to law. It proposes the application of future-oriented analysis (FTA) - as a common umbrella term that encompasses foresight, forecasting and technology assessment methods and tools - to the legal sphere. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forecasting; Foresight; Future-oriented analysis; Law; Modelling; Scenario planning; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Barré, R., Keenan, M., Revisiting foresight rationales: What lessons from the social sciences and humanities?

After a timely reminder of the objectives of this foresight study - not to predict the future, but to ""introduce a little perplexity into public policy networks"" - he outlines the questions that framed the exercise: how are we to define a metropolis in France today and what are the major trends at work in the metropolitan systems in the particular context of post-Fordism and neo-liberal globalization? In this way, he shows the extent to which the economic developments at work at the international level modify and structure economic activities, social relations and ways of living and working in the French metropolises. Drawing on this, Pinson presents the three scenarios developed for the years to 2040: the ""Mercapole"" scenario, characterized by hyperconnection, the rise of the private sector, the domination of economic interests and actors in the property market, which combines densification at the centre and urban sprawl on the outskirts; the ""Archipole"", in which metropolises pay more than due regard to public regulation, but also engage in greater surveillance of citizens, against a background of city densification and respect for the environment; and, lastly, the ""Antipole"" scenario, a scenario of decoupling from the French economy against a background of the repoliticization of urban issues and local institutions, expressed in the emergence of ""heritage"" or tourist cities, on the one hand, and cities dominated by social groups developing alternatives to the neo-liberal model on the other. In conclusion, Gilles Pinson stresses the contribution of these scenarios to the thinking of public actors with regard, in particular, to levels of decision-making (European Union, state or cities) and the directions to be taken by policies on spatial planning and development.",,,,,,,"Pinsoh, G., Rousseau, M., Les systemes metropolitains intégrés.

Whereas prior literature in information systems has highlighted the likelihood of ex post rent seeking engendered by renegotiation, we build upon literature on incomplete contracts to posit that renegotiation can be Pareto improving by incorporating contingencies revealed ex post. Research on contract renegotiation has been hampered by two sets of challenges: the lack of appropriate data and empirical challenges in identification. We circumvent this problem both by appropriate data collection and by employing an identification strategy to address alternate causal explanations. We propose a measure, Pareto improving amendments, to assess renegotiation outcomes that enhance the value from outsourcing by hazard equilibration and by incorporating learning. Using a unique sample of 141 IT outsourcing contracts, we examine the role of decision rights delineated ex ante in enabling Pareto improving amendments and in resolving the trade-off between adaptation and rent seeking. We find that flexibility provisions, termination for convenience rights, and contractual rights whereby vendors are granted rights to reuse know-how are associated with Pareto improving amendments. The results are robust to potential endogeneity of contractual provisions when parties have feasible foresight and to the possibility of adverse selection in the sample. We also examine alternate explanations from the literature on contractual breach. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed. © 2012 INFORMS.","Contractual flexibility; Incomplete contracts; IT outsourcing; Renegotiation design; Rent seeking","Adverse selection; Contractual flexibility; Data collection; Decision right; Empirical analysis; Endogeneity; Identification strategies; Incomplete contracts; Information technology outsourcing; IT outsourcing; Rent-seeking; Contracts; Design; Information technology; Pareto principle; Risk management; Technology transfer; Outsourcing",,,,,"Aghion, P., Dewatripont, M., Rey, P., Renegotiation design with unverifiable information (1994) Econometrica, 62 (2), pp. 257-282; Anderson, S.W., Dekker, H.C., Management control for market transactions (2005) Management Sci., 51 (12), pp. 1734-1752; Angrist, J., Krueger, A., Does compulsory school attendance affect schooling and earnings?

Through a literature review, potential value creation is identified. This serves as guidance for an empirical investigation in which value creation is observed and linked to methods and practices. Using data from 20 case studies, three examples of value creation are discussed in detail. In addition, cross-case analysis allowed me to identify four success criteria for corporate foresight activities: (1) foresighters committed to creating value, (2) participation of internal stakeholders, (3) analysis that follows a systemic logic, and (4) methods and processes that are tailored to companies' needs. The paper concludes with the recommendation to take a dynamic-capabilities perspective on future research into corporate foresight. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"corporate strategy; economic activity; future prospect; research; stakeholder",,,,,"Thom, N., Measuring the value contribution of corporate foresight (2010) 3rd ISPIM Innovation Symposium; van der Duin, P., Hartigh, E., Keeping the balance.

The vision building process is demonstrated by creating a concise test vision of the Finnish transport system in 2100. The vision building process combines four futures methods that support the longterm foresight approach: transition management, PESTE analysis, the futures table and the Delphi method. The process is validated with a test vision. A threestep vision building process for longterm transport system visions is structured. The three consecutive steps of the process are environmental scanning, constructing futures tables and visions, and describing visions. In addition, a demonstrative test vision is created to describe a possible future transport system in 2100 in a metropolitan Finland. The successful application of the developed method supports further work on creating fullscale strategydriven visions. Futures studies analyzing transport systems and infrastructures tend to focus on short to mediumterm perspectives. This paper presents a unique method for constructing alternative longterm visions as far as 50 to 100 years into the future. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Finland; Foresight; Future studies; Longterm; Transport system; Transportation; Vision",,,,,,"Åkerman, J., Höjer, M., How much transport can the climate stand? – Sweden on a sustainable path in 2050 (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (14), pp. 1944-1957; Anderson, B., Brynin, M., Gershuny, J., Raban, Y., (2007) Information and Communication Technologies in Society.

We explain the notion of emerging technologies, and their expected convergences, and consider both their potential and issues faced in the Australian context. Recent trends and emerging issues - such as slower, more problematic development and adoption than expected, and increasingly global competition to establish 'future industries' - are reviewed to identify a set of imperatives. These imperatives highlight emerging opportunities and challenges, focussing on how examining alternative futures and perspectives may help enable effective responses to emerging technologies.","Convergence; Emerging technologies; Expectations; Governance; Wicked problems",,,,,,"(2009) Nanotechnology: Why unions are concerned (fact sheet), , ACTU.

This approach brings to bear several issues such as the effect of the measures, the guidelines to be followed and the rights and liabilities of the ship operators in protecting their vessels, crew, passengers and property. This article discusses the various instances around the world of legislation and regulations pertaining to the use of armed guards on board sea faring vessels as well as some guidelines already issued by States. It identifies the key determinants connected to the issue such as risk assessment and management, the establishment of a security culture as well as the significance of corporate management and foresight.

Futures research ought to be methodologically and professionally sound, should to a certain extent be accurate, and should have a degree of impact on strategic decision making and policy-making. However, in the case of futures studies, the one does not automatically lead to the other. Quality of method does not ensure success, just as quality and success do not guarantee impact. This article explores the new paths for understanding evaluating of futures studies that are provided by the various articles in this special issue and sets out an agenda for next steps with regard to evaluation of futures research. The more structural and systematic evaluation can result in an increased level of trust in futures research, which may in turn lead to more future oriented strategy, policy and decision making. Therefore, evaluation should be seen as more than a burden of accountability - albeit important as accountability is - but as an investment in the credibility and impact of the profession. It may set in motion a cycle of mutual learning that will not only improve the capacity of futures-researchers but will also enhance the capacity and likeliness of decision-makers to apply insight from futures research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"accountability; decision making; future prospect; learning; methodology; organizational framework; policy making; research",,,,,,"Van der Steen, M.; The Netherlands School of Public Administration, Lange Voorhout 17, 2514 EB The Hague, Netherlands; email: steen@nsob.nl",,,,,,,,00163287,,,,"English","Futures",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860592580

By means of four case studies, the success factors and barriers that policy-makers encounter as they apply future exploration methods will be elaborated on. Attention will be paid to the different motives and intentions employed when opting for future exploration methods.

Respondents' risk judgments changed in ways consistent with their reported personal experiences. However, they did not recognize these changes, producing hindsight bias in memories for their judgments. An intensive debiasing procedure failed to restore a foresightful perspective. A fear-inducing manipulation increased risk estimates, whereas an anger-inducing manipulation reduced them-both in predictions (as previously observed) and in memories and judgments of past risks. Thus, priming emotions shaped not only perceptions of an abstract future but also perceptions of a concrete past.

NBN's current roll-out is scheduled for completion in 2021, with market forecasts estimating optical fibre overtaking DSL broadband connections in about 2015. This paper provides a timely contribution to more critical and expansive analysis of potential Australian internet futures. First, 'schools of thought' and current technological frames (Web 2.0, 'the cloud') for the internet and its possible futures are outlined, which provide perspectives on the emergence of the NBN. We then outline five generic images of the future which, as predetermined images, enable quick 'incasting' of alternative futures for a technology topic or related object of research: promised future, social/ speculative bubble(s), unfolding disruption/chaos, unintended consequences, and co-existence/'cooption'. High-level application of the 'schools' and generic images to the NBN and Australia's potential internet futures, suggests policymakers and strategists currently consider too few perspectives.","Australia; Incasting; Internet; National broadband network; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Apperley, T., Nansen, B., Arnold, M., Wilken, R., Broadband in the burbs: NBN infrastructure, spectrum politics and the digital home.""

The archipelago has a total land area of 8249 km2 and a coastline of 1962 km. The Saltwater Crocodile Crocodilus porosus is a common species throughout the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It can be encountered in open sea, near the shore, mangrove creeks, freshwater rivers and in swamps. Human-animal conflicts have increased with exploitation of natural forest resources in India. The growth of human population, intensified land-use, increased livestock population e.g. goat, cattle, dog, poultry etc., human pressure, modification of natural resources, habitat fragmentation, and lack of foresight in the implementation of policies are some of the factors behind the current disputes. Crocodile attacks on human beings and livestock have been reported since the early 1970s in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Recently, a crocodile killed a woman snorkelling at the famous Radha Nagar Beach, Havelock forest division. Immediately, the Department of Environment and Forests of the Andaman and Nicobar Administration urged locals to be vigilant of the presence of crocodiles around Radha Nagar Beach, and a warning sign board was placed on the beach. The Forest Department decided to capture the problematic crocodile, and gathered a team to do so. The captured crocodile was transported and released into the mini zoo at Port Blair, and peace was restored at Radha Nagar Beach. In such a situation, removal of the problem crocodile might provide a temporary fix, but another male will eventually dominate the creek, and may again be a threat to tourism. Possible reasons for crocodile attack on humans include defending individual territories, attractive food-sources such as livestock and other domestic animals, and dumping of high-protein waste food materials on banks or beach areas. The indigenous technology developed for capturing the crocodile is discussed in this paper.",,,,,,,"Andrews, H.V., (1997) Population Dynamics and Ecology of the Saltwater Crocodile (Crocodylus Porosus Schneider) in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Present work is the documentation of indigenous knowledge on plant utilization as natural remedy by the inhabitants of terai forest in Western Nepal.Methods: Study was conducted during 2010-2011 following standard ethnobotanical methods. Data about medicinal uses of plants were collected by questionnaire, personal interview and group discussion with pre identified informants. Voucher specimens were collected with the help of informants, processed into herbarium following standard methods, identified with the help of pertinent floras and taxonomic experts, and submitted in Department of Botany, Butwal Multiple Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal for future references.Results: During the present study 66 medicinal plant species belonging to 37 families and 60 genera has been documented. These plants were used to treat various diseases and ailments grouped under 11 disease categories, with the highest number of species (41) being used for gastro-intestinal disorders, followed by dermatological disorders (34). In the study area the informants' consensus about usages of medicinal plants ranges from 0.93 to 0.97 with an average value of 0.94. Herbs (53%) were the primary source of medicine, followed by trees (23%). Curcuma longa (84%) and Azadirachta indica (76%) are the most frequently and popularly used medicinal plant species in the study area. Acacia catechu, Bacopa monnieri, Bombax ceiba, Drymaria diandra, Rauvolfia serpentina, and Tribulus terrestris are threatened species which needs to be conserved for future use.Conclusions: The high degree of consensus among the informants suggests that current use and knowledge are still strong, and thus the preservation of today's knowledge shows good foresight in acting before much has been lost. The connections between plant use and conservation are also important ones, especially as the authors note that neither the local inhabitants nor the government is addressing the potential loss of valuable species in this region. © 2012 Singh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Ethnobotany; Magar; Medicinal plants; Nepal; Terai forest; Tharu; Traditional healers","Acacia catechu; Azadirachta indica; Bacopa monnieri; Bombax; Bombax ceiba; Ceiba; Curcuma longa; Drymaria cordata diandra; Rauvolfia; Rauvolfia serpentina; Tribulus terrestris; plant medicinal product; adult; aged; angiosperm; article; attitude to health; environmental protection; ethnobotany; female; gastrointestinal disease; human; interview; male; medicinal plant; middle aged; Nepal; phytotherapy; questionnaire; skin disease; species difference; traditional medicine; tree; Adult; Aged; Angiosperms; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ethnobotany; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Nepal; Phytotherapy; Plant Preparations; Plants, Medicinal; Questionnaires; Skin Diseases; Species Specificity; Trees",,"Plant Preparations",,,"World Health Organization (2001) General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine, , WHO Switzerland, Geneva; Bhattarai, S., Chaudhary, R.P., Taylor, R.S.L., Ethnomedicinal plants used by the people of Manang district, central Nepal (2006) J Ethnobiol Ethnomed, 2, p. 41. , 10.1186/1746-4269-2-41, 1618386, 17020612; Ghimire, K., Bastakoti, R.R., Ethnomedicinal knowledge and healthcare practices among the Tharus of Nawalparasi district in central Nepal (2009) Forest Ecol Manag, 257, pp. 2066-2072; Joshi, K., Joshi, A.R., Indigenous knowledge and uses of medicinal plants by local communities of the Kali Gandaki Watershed Area, Nepal (2000) J Ethnopharmacol, 73, pp. 175-183. , 10.1016/S0378-8741(00)00301-9, 11025154; Joshi, K., Joshi, R., Joshi, A.R., Indigenous knowledge and uses of medicinal plants in Macchegaun, Nepal (2011) Indian J Tradit Know, 10, pp. 281-286; Kunwar, R.M., Uprety, Y., Burlakoti, C., Chaudhary, C.L., Bussmann, R.W., Indigenous Use and Ethnopharmacology of Medicinal Plants in Far-west Nepal (2009) Ethnobot Res Appl, 7, pp. 5-28; Mahato, R.B., Chaudhary, R.P., Ethnomedicinal Study and Antibacterial activities of selected plants of Palpa district, Nepal (2003) Scientific World, 2, pp. 38-45; Rajbhandari, K.R., (2001) Ethnobotany of Nepal, , Ethnobotanical Society of Nepal, Nepal; Manandhar, N.P., Ethnobotanical note on folk-lore medicines of Baglang district, Nepal (1993) Contribution to Nepalese Studies, 20 (2), pp. 183-196; Manandhar, N.P., A survey of medicinal plants of Jajarkot district, Nepal (1995) J Ethnopharmacol, 48, pp. 1-6. , 10.1016/0378-8741(95)01269-J, 8569241; Manandhar, N.P., (2002) Plants and People of Nepal, , Timber Press Portland, Oregon, USA; Manandher, N.P., Ethnobotanical census on herbal medicines of Banke district, Nepal (1998) Contribution to Nepalese Studies, 25, pp. 57-63; Shrestha, P.M., Dhillion, S.S., Medicinal plant diversity and use in the highlands of Dolakha district, Nepal (2003) J Ethnopharmacol, 86, pp. 81-96. , 10.1016/S0378-8741(03)00051-5, 12686446; Acharya, K.P., Acharya, R., Ethnobotanical Study of Medicinal Plants Used By Tharu Community of Parroha VDC, Rupandehi District, Nepal (2009) Scientific World, 7 (7), pp. 80-84; Bhattarai, N.K., Traditional Medicine, Medicinal plants and biodiversity conservation in the global and Nepalese contexts (1998) Plant Research, 1, pp. 22-31; Bhattarai, S., Chaudhary, R.P., Taylor, R.S.L., Ethno-medicinal Plants Used by the People of Nawalparasi District, Central Nepal (2009) Our Nature, 7, pp. 82-99; Eigner, D., Scholz, D., Ferula asa-foetida and Curcuma longa in traditional medical treatment and diet in Nepal (1999) J Ethnopharmacolo, 67, pp. 1-6; Rokaya, M.B., Munzbergovaa, Z., Timsina, B., Ethnobotanical study of medicinal plants from the Humla district of western Nepal (2010) J Ethnopharmacol, 130, pp. 485-504. , 10.1016/j.jep.2010.05.036, 20553834; Upreti, Y., Asselin, H., Boon, E.K., Yadav, S., Shrestha, K.K., Indigenous use and bio-efficacy of medicinal plants in the Rasuwa District (2010) Central Nepal.

In the long history of services management delivered by Rolls-Royce, RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety) has remained a key principle for service delivery and we have worked to evolve a services infrastructure tailored to deliver both the responsiveness and foresight demanded by today's customers. Contracts for Rolls-Royce services like TotalCare, CorporateCare and MissionCare are essentially performance based contracts for in-service systems delivered through the theory of know, predict, control. Where know, involves understanding the current fleet status and maintaining the data management structure required to respond to that status. Predict, involves forecasting the future fleet status and proactively identifying future potential threats and opportunities. Finally, control, involves the actual management of the future fleet status with a team focused on both tactical and strategic objectives. This three-core theory is directly supported by a three-core organizational infrastructure based around data, business, and fleet-support management which in turn drive customer satisfaction and deliver on customer commitments. Hence, this paper will elaborate on this theory of know, predict, control, relate it to the Rolls-Royce Services organizational infrastructure, and explain how a RAMS-centric forecast capability is leveraged as the decision-support heart of services management using the method of forecast, analyze, validate, optimize, and recommend. Note, that whilst many of the examples in this paper are Aerospace related, the principals, tools, and methods described are applicable for all systems, across all sectors, and in support of all customers. © 2012 IEEE.","Decision-Support; Forecasting; Management; Product-Service Systems","Cost of ownership; Decision-Support; Management structure; Operational capabilities; Organizational infrastructure; Performance based; Potential threats; Product-service systems; Rolls-royce; Service delivery; Services management; Strategic objectives; Volatile environments; Customer satisfaction; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Information management; Maintainability; Management; Reliability; Sales; Fleet operations",,,,,"Plc, R.-R., (2011) Annual Report 2010, , www.rollsroyce.com/reports/2010, accessed: 6th July; Cullen, P.A., Butcher, B., Hickman, R., Keast, J., Saving time and costs: A comparison between the defence and civil aerospace sectors (2005) RUSI Defence Systems, 8 (1), pp. 58-60; (2007) Transforming Logistics Support for Fast Jets, , NAO, Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, HC 825, Session 2006-2007, 17 July; Ng, I.C.L., (2011) Service Transformation and the New Landscape of Performance-based Contracting: An Executive Briefing, , centers.exeter.ac.uk, Center for Service Research, 2008, accessed: 6th July; Kratz, L.A., Buckingham, B.A., Achieving outcomes- based life cycle management (2010) Defense Acquisition Review Journal, 17 (1), pp. 45-66; Ng, I.C.L., Maull, R., Yip, N., Outcome-based contracts as a driver for systems thinking and service-dominant logic in service science: Evidence from the defence industry (2009) European Management Journal, 27 (6), pp. 377-387; Kratz, L.A., Achieving performance-based lifecycle management (2009) Proceedings of the 6th Annual Acquisition Research Symposium, 1, pp. 147-161; Allmendinger, G., Lombreglia, R., Four strategies for the age of smart services (2005) Harvard Business Review, , Oct; Richards, C., (2004) Certain to Win: The Strategy of John Boyd, Applied to Business, , Xlibris Corporation; Shewhart, W.A., (1986) Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control, , edited W.

Insights from two standard optimizing monetary settings and economic reasoning from case studies of extreme hyperinflation episodes provide relevant requirements for the specification of the demand for money during hyperinflation. The paper demonstrates that the possibility of perfect foresight monetary hyperinflation paths depends robustly on the essentiality of money. The essentiality of money provides some depth of explanation of the reasons why the popular semi-log schedule of the demand for money is not appropriate for analysing monetary hyperinflation with perfect foresight.

In this first instalment, the analysis is directed at the dynamics of industrial territories. After briefly rehearsing the approach and method used in the ""Territories 2040"" exercise, Gilles Le Blanc reports on the foresight study carried out on industrial territories. He first defines what is covered by the notion of ""industrial territories"" (on the basis, among other things, of a ""geography of industrial and productive activities""), then specifies the main factors affecting the development of those territories and the range of problems associated with them (particularly the issues of company boundaries and innovation). He then presents the four scenarios imagined for the industrial territories up to the year 2040, entitled respectively: ""Green Industrial Reconstruction"", ""Effervescence"", ""Citadels"" and ""Alternative Industrialization"". He goes on to stress the main issues associated with these scenarios in terms of public policy and spatial planning, emphasizing in particular the possible uses of the scenarios, the geography of industrial and productive activities that would ensue from these scenarios up to 2040 and, lastly, the key factors, the risks and threats related to each scenario.",,,,,,,"(1971) Une Image de la France en l'an 2000.

Seemingly, the magnitude of the alarms increases at a pace that outcompetes the concerns it seems to generate in public policies and discourses. Are we perhaps, as some suggest, in the middle of a huge public denial? Why is this so? What could design and design research possibly do about it? This paper briefly discusses some characteristic features within the domains of society, science and design (including architecture) and how these three domains interrelate when it comes to the challenge of climate change and global sustainability. The intention is to create a creative analytical field of tensions, with complementary actors. The paper then especially focuses on possible contributions from the domain of design. One of the conclusions is that the challenge is so huge that we need to utilize a variety of professional domains of competence and that all should contribute where their involvement will make most difference. We therefore suggest that perhaps the most important contribution that design can make is to suggest new possible, preferable and radically different alternatives of living. Here the intention is to facilitate creative discourses rather than creating creative solutions that direct solve all the complex problems at hand. A master course in design, entitled 'Shaping futures', where students are required to come up with plausible scenarios that address possible climate changes, is used as an illustrative example. In order to address climate change the course joins the domains of foresight, innovation and design. The course reveals both opportunities for design work, and also areas where design as a discipline needs further development. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Architecture; Climate change; Design; Education; Foresight; Heterodox design; Innovation; Sustainability","architectural design; climate change; heterogeneity; innovation; student; sustainability",,,,,"Alfsen, K.H., (2009), Fem om Stadsbudsjet.

We first show that "" narrative"" shocks are orthogonal to the relevant information set a fiscal VAR. We then derive impulse responses to these shocks. The use of narrative shocks does not require the inversion of the moving-average representation of a VAR for the identification of the relevant shocks. Therefore, within this framework, fiscal multipliers can be identified and estimated even when, in the presence of ""fiscal foresight,"" the MA representation of the VARs is not invertible.",,,,,,,"Bagliano, F.C., Favero, C.A., Information from Financial Markets and VAR Measures of Monetary Policy (1999) European Economic Review, 43 (4-6), pp. 825-837; Blanchard, O.J., Output, the Stock Market, and Interest Rates (1981) American Economic Review, 71 (1), pp. 132-143; Blanchard, O., Perotti, R., An Empirical Characterization of the Dynamic Effects of Changes in Government Spending and Taxes on Output (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (4), pp. 1329-1368; Bohn, H., The Behavior of U S.

The proposed method is composed of two control schemes. One is a multiple-purpose pole control (MPPC) for the stabilization of an unstable nonlinear plant and the other is simulator-based foresight control (SFC) which aims the suppression of disturbance and the compensation of deviation errors. In MPPC, an unstable nonlinear plant can be stabilized by means of old fashioned pole assignment control method. The procedure of tuning of control parameters is performed with simulator-study assisted design by just observing the responses of state variables. In SFC, the suppression of disturbance can be realized by the insertion of servo filter in line of disturbance which can adjust the relative degree of disturbance. In addition, ideal convergence of errors of state variables can be realized by defining control target equation which describes an ideal convergence dynamics of deviation errors. The proposed SFC can be applied for the full range disturbance, and can predict output behavior of nonlinear plant at any load level. In this brief, the simulation results on the control of a stable nonlinear boiler with 50 width load change of a 14th order model as well as many unstable nonlinear system models are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2011 IEEE.","Control target equation; hybrid control; multiple-purpose pole control (MPPC); nonlinear plant; servo type filter; simulator-based foresight control (SFC)","Control target; Hybrid controls; Nonlinear plant; Pole control; simulator-based foresight control (SFC); Errors; Nonlinear equations; Poles; Simulators; Stabilization; Boiler control",,,,,"Padma Sree, R., Chidambaram, M., (2009) Control of Unstable Systems, , Delhi, India: Narosa; Li, J., Qian, C., Global finite-time stabilization by dynamic output feedback for a class of continuous nonlinear systems (2006) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 51 (5), pp. 879-884. , DOI 10.1109/TAC.2006.874991; Qu, Z., Hull, R.A., Wang, J., Globally stabilizing adaptive control design for nonlinearly- parameterized systems (2006) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 51 (6), pp. 1073-1079. , DOI 10.1109/TAC.2006.876800; Xu, J., Xie, L.H., Wang, Y.Y., Simultaneous stabilization robust control of polynominal nonlinear systems using SOS techniques (2009) IEEE Trans.

Industrial energy demands, Kyoto agreement and carbon trade are shown as probable causes. Currently, Turkey has a total installed capacity of about 48.5GW for electricity from all energy sources. High energy prices and unstable suppliers have stimulated Turkey's growing interest in wind business and wind power. This paper analyzes Turkey's wind energy future perspective and power generation strategy with a view to explaining Delphi approach to wind energy development. In this study, the two-round Delphi survey was conducted by experts to determine and measure the expectations of the sector representatives through online surveys where a total of 70 experts responded from 24 different locations. The majority of the Delphi survey respondents were from 23 different universities (60%), electricity generation industries (21%), two different governmental organizations (11%), nongovernmental organizations (6%) and other institutions (2%). The article discusses not only the expert sights on wind energy technology but also all bibliometrical approaches. The results showed that Turkey's wind power installed capacity is expected to exceed 40GW by the end of the 2020s and in the middle of the 2030s, and Turkey would be the European leading country in the field of electricity generation from the wind. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Delphi survey; Lead markets; Market penetration; Technology foresight; Wind energy","Electricity generation; Energy future; Energy sector; Energy source; High energy prices; Industrial energy; Installed capacity; Kyoto agreements; Market penetration; Nongovernmental organizations; Online surveys; Technology foresight; Turkishs; Wind energy development; Wind energy industry; Wind energy technology; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Industry; Societies and institutions; Wind power; Surveys",,,,,"Sahin, A.D., Progress and recent trends in wind energy (2004) Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 30, pp. 501-543; Cherry, N.J., Wind energy resources survey methodology (1980) Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 5, pp. 247-280; Ackerman, T., Söder, L., Wind energy technology and current status: a review (2000) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 4 (4), pp. 315-374; Yang, W.J., Aydin, O., Wind energy hydrogen storage hybrid power generation (2001) International Journal of Energy Research, 25, pp. 449-463; Davenport, A.G., Past, present and future of wind engineering (2002) Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 90, pp. 1371-1380; Bossanyi, E.A., Wind turbine control for load reduction (2003) Wind Energy, 6 (3), pp. 229-244; Elizondo, J., Martinez, J., Probst, O., Experimental study of a small wind turbine for low- and medium-wind regimes (2009) International Journal of Energy Research, 33, pp. 309-326; Murakami, S., Mochida, A., Kato, S., Development of local area wind prediction system for selecting suitable site for windmill (2003) Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 91 (12-15), pp. 1759-1776; Baker, C.J., Past, present and future development of wind energy (2007) Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 95, pp. 843-870; (2009), World Wind Energy Report 2008 prepared by WWEA.

It needs to be more open about its governance and financing plans, something missing from the latest European Commission communication.

Consequently, environmental technologies are regarded as one of the fastest growing global markets. Owing to the wide range of technologies available that can contribute to progress in this field, there is a high demand for prospective research setting priorities in a transparent way. Against this background, the presented study aimed at supporting the process of identifying and recommending options for the prioritisation of future research funding. Taking Germany as an example, this was done by analysing chances and perspectives of different environmental technologies as well as courses of action in combination with the aim of reaching new markets for seven environmental fields of action: Climate protection, air pollution control, water management, soil conservation, protection of scarce resources, waste management and biodiversity. As a key-element of the study, future environmental challenges and promising future technological developments were identified by an extensive literature review and internet research, followed by a large-scale expert survey and several topic-specific workshops. Results demonstrate that one focus of future funding should be put on technology development for meeting the demands of emerging and developing countries. Thus, an appropriate response for the German environmental industry to such global challenges requires the provision of exportable environmental technologies, although this will change the requirement profiles of the technologies. Many high-tech-products, developed for the European market, are not directly applicable or invaluable for emerging and developing countries. The study also recommends that funding should not concentrate on individual technologies, but rather on holistic views of technologies, processes, material and energy flows. Furthermore, the estimations of market potential for the investigated technologies are closely connected to the ecological problems and their social perception in different countries. Basis strategies should be developed, which take into account the technical development as well as the main drivers and constrains. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus an equilibrium selection result similar to those on robustness to incomplete information (Morris and Ui (2005) [14]), and on perfect foresight dynamic (Oyama et al. (2008) [18]) holds for the log-linear dynamic. An example shows that stochastic stability of an LP-max is not guaranteed for non-potential games without the supermodularity condition. We investigate sensitivity of the log-linear dynamic to cardinal payoffs and its consequence on the stability of weighted local potential maximizer. In particular, for 2 × 2 games, we examine a modified log-linear dynamic (relative log-linear dynamic) under which local potential maximizer with positive weights is stochastically stable. The proof of the main result relies on an elementary method for stochastic ordering of Markov chains. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Comparison of Markov chains; Equilibrium selection; Local potential maximizer; Log-linear dynamic; Relative log-linear dynamic; Stochastic order; Stochastic stability",,,,,,"Alós-Ferrer, C., Netzer, N., The logit-response dynamics (2010) Games Econ.

One approach to better understand barriers and facilitators to providing CPS is to use a work system approach to examine different components of a work system and how the components may impact care processes. Objectives: The goals of this study were to identify and describe pharmacy work system characteristics that pharmacists identified and changed to provide CPS in a demonstration program. Methods: A qualitative approach was used for data collection. A purposive sample of 8 pharmacists at 6 community pharmacies participating in a demonstration program was selected to be interviewed. Each semistructured interview was audio recorded and transcribed, and the text was analyzed in a descriptive and interpretive manner by 3 analysts. Themes were identified in the text and aligned with 1 of 5 components of the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) work system model (organization, tasks, tools/technology, people, and environment). Results: A total of 21 themes were identified from the interviews, and 7 themes were identified across all 6 interviews. The organization component of the SEIPS model contained the most (n. =10) themes. Numerous factors within a pharmacy work system appear important to enable pharmacists to provide CPS. Leadership and foresight by the organization to implement processes (communication, coordination, planning, etc.) to facilitate providing CPS was a key finding across the interviews. Expanding technician responsibilities was reported to be essential for successfully implementing CPS.

Due to its relatively high costs, duration, mobilisation of human resources and know-how, its hitherto applications were attributed mainly to long-term strategy formation in large corporations and as a tool supporting policy making. This paper will show how the recent development of web technologies and a public availability of foresight results have allowed to provide access to high-level roadmapping even for small and medium-sized enterprises. We will describe an implementation of the roadmapping process in .NET that may serve as an on-line interactive strategic planning and decision support system applying information technology foresight results. The system may be used as a base to solving IT investment planning problems and new product development and market placement problems (NPD-MP) in innovative companies. A web-based analytic machine that supports roadmapping is able to generate optimal technological investment strategies, visualised as multicriteria shortest paths in classical roadmapping diagrams. The system uses the integrated capacity offered by ontologies and semantic networks is a complex collaborative process of knowledge acquisition from heterogeneous information sources, its managing, sharing and processing. An example of the roadmapping process applied to develop a new computer based on IT foresight results will also be presented. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Collaborative process; Heterogeneous information sources; High costs; Investment strategy; IT investments; Know-how; Long-term strategy; Mobilisation; Multi-criteria; New product development; Placement problems; Policy making; Roadmapping; Semantic network; Shortest path; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Strategic planning process; System use; Tool supporting; Web technologies; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Industry; Investments; Knowledge acquisition; Product development; Semantics; Strategic planning; Technology transfer; Information technology",,,,,"Howard, R.A., Matheson, J.E., Influence diagrams (2005) Decision Analysis, 2 (3), pp. 127-143; Skulimowski, A.M.J., On multicriteria problems with modification of attributes (2007) MCDM 2006, pp. 117-136. , Trzaskalik, T.

Real indeterminacy arises in this setting in the form of continuum of equilibria corresponding to different commodity allocations. The cause of real indeterminacy is arbitrariness of prices at the final date. If some arbitrary price tends to infinity then the equilibrium in the limit has an intuitive economic interpretation. The limiting equilibrium with formally infinite prices we interpret as an equilibrium with default: if a special state of the environment occurs, consumers may forget about their debts and savings and start new life from scratch. Existence of equilibria with defaults is proven. A numerical experiment shows that in some cases equilibria with finite prices are Pareto dominated by equilibria with defaults. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Whether one is investigating an electrical incident in-house, or investigating as an expert witness, the nature of forensic investigation is largely the same. Whether analyzing a product failure or advising an attorney, forensic investigations are driven by similar principles and process. The goal is to find the truth, document the facts, find who or what is at fault, advise and educate others, and act to drive a remedy for bad situations. Forensic meaning 'applying scientific knowledge to legal issues', implies interaction with that annoying sub-species known as the lawyer. Although often quite knowledgeable regarding the subject matter, few forensic investigators are schooled in the cross-over between the engineering and legal worlds. At the end of the day, the forensic expert is tasked with educating a population unfamiliar with the environment in which the incident occurred and the technology involved in the incident. Forensic investigation starts with fact finding. For the in-house investigator, this may be relatively easy. For the consultant attached to litigation, fact finding is conducted through a formal process called ""discovery."" Contrary to what many believe, preserving evidence and avoiding spoliation is the responsibility of everyone involved in the investigation. Once the facts are known, forensic investigators are tasked with developing working theories, answering the unanswered questions, and assigning probabilities to alternative explanations. In complex scenarios, knowing what occurred to the legal standard of ""more likely than not"" may become more difficult than not. No matter what lawyers and employers tell their forensic team, forensic investigators must remain independent and at times be painfully honest. The worst mistake made during an investigation is trying to develop answers that serve one's client that are contrary to the facts and probabilities. Forensic experts should leave the ""circle the wagons"" mentality to the attorneys. Many an expert (including this author) has learned the costly lesson that being a ""team player"" often does not survive the harsh and adversarial environment of the courtroom. Letting the legal team assess litigation risk based on the real truth and non-sugar-coated facts serves the best interests of one's client. Forensic investigators should not play lawyer, should not play adversary, and should not over-invest in the outcome of the investigation. They should do what engineers are trained to do, the way that engineers are trained to do it. In the words of the great Jack Webb, forensic investigation is about ""just the facts."" © 2012 IEEE.","electric safety; electric shock; electrical injury; expert witness; Forensic engineering","Adversarial environments; Cross-over; Electric safety; Electric shock; Electrical injuries; Electrical safety; End of the days; expert witness; Fact-finding; Forensic investigation; Legal issues; Legal standards; Product failures; Risk-based; Scientific knowledge; Subject matters; Team players; Electric accidents; Engineers; Laws and legislation; Safety engineering; Sugars; Forensic engineering",,,,,"(2004) Blacks Law Dictionary, , 8th edition; Frye v.

We suggest that one of the reasons for this is the dominance of a structural view of strategy and competition. Alternative views, such as the Austrian school or those that stress the Red Queen effect, emphasize the process-based nature of competition. In fast-changing environments, speed and reaction are central attributes, which render the traditional separation between planning and execution untenable. In these contexts, improvisation, the convergence of planning and execution, becomes a paradoxical form of ""real time foresight"": organizations screen trends, spot opportunities, actively wait and/or act with speed to seize the moment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Fast changing environments; Foresight; Improvisation; Planning","conceptual framework; environmental change; planning method; prediction; real time",,,,,"Purser, R.E., Petranker, J., Unfreezing the future.

Thus, the need of techniques to control or reduce the amount of changes during software development projects. The authors advocate the use of foresight methods as a valuable input to requirements elicitation, with the potential to decrease the number of changes that would be required after deployment, by anticipating them. In this paper, the authors define a process for using a foresight method, namely Futures Wheel, for requirements elicitation. To illustrate the use of this approach, the authors perform a case study using a route planning system.

Weak signals are signs anticipating or pointing to possibly emerging new issues. Weak signals can be perceived through all five human senses: they can be seen, heard, smelled, felt or even tasted. Visual weak signals are weak signals shown in a visual form. They can be represented as images: photos, paintings, drawings, video clips, etc. [2]. The method used by the Futures Window is to display weak signals in a visual form as a slide show on a large screen with the aim of encouraging people to anticipate and innovate futures. The Futures Window could be a central tool to be used in Creative Foresight Spaces (CFS). 11The idea for the concept of Creative Foresight Space originated during two research projects ""Technology Futures Forum"" and ""SOMED"" (Social media at the crossroads of physical, virtual and digital worlds), initiated by Dr. Sirkka Heinonen, and first described in the conference presentation by Toni Ahlqvist, Minna Halonen and Sirkka Heinonen ""Social Media Applications for Innovative Working Environments"" 9th International Conference of Finland Futures Research Centre and Finland Futures Academy ""Culture and Innovation - The search for Creative Power in Economics and Societies"".

Research report VTT-R-04539-07. http://owela.vtt.fi/owela/uploads/2007/11/making-sense-of-social-media-vtt-r-04539-07.pdf. The concept of CFS is offered as one way of responding to the growing demand for innovation in corporations and work organisations. The FW method was tested at VTT Technical Research Centre (http://www.vtt.fi/) in Finland in two pilots in 2006-2007. A survey was conducted to gather employee's opinions of the FW experiments. The results show that employees considered the FW positively and they confirmed that it stimulated futures thinking. The results of this study are encouraging for further developing the Futures Window as a key element of CFS.

Dynamic behavior is determined essentially by two types of entities: on one hand, the degree of information stickiness that characterizes the price-setting decisions of firms and the consumption and labor supply decisions of households and, on the other hand, a policy parameter that indicates how the central bank acts in order to stabilize prices. Under perfect foresight, stability will hold and the degree of information stickiness simply indicates the velocity of convergence towards the steady-state. If the ability to forecast future events is less than perfect, stability will then depend on monetary policy-the main result is that the stickier the diffusion of information is, the more aggressive monetary policy must be in order to guarantee convergence towards the long-term steady-state. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Expectations; Perfect foresight; Stability; Sticky-information; Transitional dynamics",,,,,,"Carrillo, J.A., (2010) How well does sticky information explain inflation and output inertia?, , METEOR Research Memoranda number 018; Carroll, C.D., Macroeconomic expectations of households and professional forecasters (2003) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, pp. 269-298; Christiano, L.J., Eichenbaum, M., Evans, C.L., Nominal rigidities and the dynamic effect of a shock to monetary policy (2005) Journal of Political Economy, 113, pp. 1-45; Coibion, O., Testing the sticky information Phillips curve (2010) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 92, pp. 87-101; Coibion, O., Gorodnichenko, Y., (2008) Strategic interaction among heterogeneous price-setters in an estimated DSGE model, , NBER working paper n o 14323; Dopke, J., Dovern, J., Fritsche, U., Slacalek, J., Sticky information Phillips curves: European evidence (2008) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 40, pp. 1513-1520; Gomes, O., The sticky-information macro model: Beyond perfect foresight (2010) Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, 14 (1), pp. 1-35. , article 1; Khan, H., Zhu, Z., Estimates of the sticky-information Phillips curve for the United States (2006) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 38, pp. 195-208; Kiley, M.T., A quantitative comparison of sticky-price and sticky-information models of price setting (2007) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 39, pp. 101-125; Korenok, O., Empirical comparison of sticky price and sticky information models (2008) Journal of Macroeconomics, 30, pp. 906-927; Korenok, O., Swanson, N.R., How sticky is sticky enough?

As a form of foresight raw material, ""weak signals"" can be thought of as gross, unstructured, fragmented, incomplete and inadvertent environmental data that may be refined into valuable information regarding context and further be articulated into strategically actionable knowledge. As advanced indicators that precede significant discrete one-off events and/or novel developments in the rate and direction of trends, their analysis has the potential to facilitate the real-time alignment between organisational decision-making and changing external circumstances. These predictors of future change pose fundamental problems of identification and interpretation and represent a challenge to established mental models. Thus, the practical significance of weak signals is that they can be transformed into meaningful insight for policy action. Such a value, however, does not materialise automatically. Realising this potential requires a degree of tolerance and fluidity of the collective cognitive frameworks by which weak signals can be apprehended, assessed and acted upon. This paper aims at covering the scope of perceptions and actions typically involved in the tracing and tracking of this shaping process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"cognition; data interpretation; decision making; modeling; perception; prediction; signal processing",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) Californian Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, , Prentice-Hall International Inc., USA; Diamond, J., (2004) Collapse, , Penguin, New York; Diamond, J., (2004) Twilight at Easter, , www.nybooks.com, New York Review of Books, available at; Lakatos, I., (1978) The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Philosophical Papers, 1. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Tegamar, M., Many lives in many worlds (2007) Nature, 448 (5), pp. 23-24; Kuhn, T.S., (1970) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, , Chicago University Press, Chicago; Castells, M., Information technology and global capitalism (2000) Living in Global Capitalism, pp. 52-74. , On the Edge, Jonathan Cape, London, W.

By adopting the scenario analysis technique, the response of water level of the Taihu Lake to future climate change and human activities is simulated by using the distributed hydrological model VIC coupled with the hydraulic model ISIS, while the future climate scenarios are generated by the regional climate model PRECIS. The results show that there is a significant increasing trend of impervious surface area, while other types of land cover show decreasing trends during 2021-2050. Furthermore, the maximum and mean flood water levels under future scenarios (2021-2050) will be greater than that under the baseline scenario (1961-1990), and the return periods of storm resulting in the same flood water level will reduce remarkably, implying more frequent occurrence of big floods in the future.

The original main objectives, funding of road maintenance and -expansion and the financing of public budgets, are more and more pushed into the background through steering-policy objectives (demandside management, environmental protection, internalisation of external costs). Beginning with toll stations withmanual payment to satellite-based toll systems, there are various technologies, to be selected by various relevant criteria. The toll amount varies depending on different vehicle criteria (usually length, height and number of axles). In recent years, the vehicle weight and emission criteria have also become an issue. This requires more complex classification and enforcement technologies. A major challenge is that many toll systems, unfortunately, despite all efforts, are still not interoperable. It has also been contemplates that the tolling technology could also be used for other ITS applications (e. g. e-Call, various information services). Furthermore, it is the political objective (at least that of the EU) that in future not only heavy goods vehicles but all vehicles must pay a mileage-based fee. And on each and every road, not just on the primary road network.

Even before completing the consolidation of their power on a local level, some members of the family - first Placido senior and then the son Francesco junior (1686-1759) - move to the capital, while the rest of the family continues to reside on the site of their recent affirmation, cooperating in the management of the estate. Francesco junior, with skill and foresight, takes advantage of the complex political situation characterised by sudden changes of the dominant dynasty and makes an extraordinary political and social ascent, constructing his own political career and obtaining, thanks to an opportune marriage, the title of Duke of Villarosa. In the mid-1700s, after a process of power construction that lasted four generations - and with the integral involvement and ""teamwork"" of all members of the family - the Notarbartolo Dukes di Villarosa reach the acme of their fortune, entering the ranks of the great Sicilian aristocracy.","Dukes of Villarosa; Feudal lords; Inheritance strategies; Matrimonial policy; Modern age; Notarbartolo; Public offices; Sicily",,,,,,"Ligresti, D., Calabrese, M.C., (2002) I Paternò di Raddusa.

Il possesso di un feudo popolato, inoltre, conferiva il diritto ereditario a sedere in Parlamento nel braccio baronale, detenendo un numero di seggi pari al numero dei feudi popolati sotto il proprio dominio, con l'evidente conseguenza che il grosso del potere all'interno del Parlamento stesso si concentrava nelle mani di pochi feudatari; Raggioni del Sig.

The following theories and associated theoretical frameworks are discussed in the article: (1) Environmental Scanning Model, (2) Nonaka's Knowledge Management Theory, (3) Gammelgaard's and Ritter's Knowledge Retrieval Matrix, (4) Boisot's Information Space Model and (5) Vejlgaard's Diamond Shaped Trend Model. These various and nevertheless complementary perspectives are important for the further development of weak signal analysis, knowledge management theory and knowledge management practices in modern organisations as well as for anticipation and decision-making in policy-making arenas. There are still many theoretical and empirical challenges in these fields of scientific knowledge. A general conclusion is that all these frameworks provide interesting new perspectives for modern futures studies as such. Another conclusion is that there are various knowledge management (KM) and scanning frameworks available for implementing weak signal analysis. However, this paper, its observations and conclusions also imply that a more generalised approach to weak signal analysis needs to be developed and that modern KM theories should be used when developing new futures studies/foresight methodologies. According to the theoretical guidelines presented in this article, it is possible to make the suggestion that it would be wise to integrate the latest developments in weak signal analysis into knowledge management theory and vice versa. © 2011.",,"decision making; knowledge; management; policy making; signal processing; theoretical study",,,,,"Ansoff, I.H., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic issues management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Ansoff, I.H., Strategic Response in Turbulent Environments (1982), Working Paper No. 82-35, European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, August; Ansoff, I.H., (1984) Implanting Strategic Management, p. 510. , Prentice/Hall International; Ansoff, I.H., Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 19, pp. 2-19; Webb, J.R., An evaluation of Igor Ansoff's theory of weak signal management by means of an investigation and forecast of future developments in the ophthalmic laser environment (1987), Doctoral thesis, University of Strathclyde; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part I: Introduction (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrintro.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part II: Information Theory (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/infotheory.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part III: Sampling, Uncertainty and Phase Shifts in Weak Signal Evolution (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrsampl.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Weak Signal Research, Part IV: Evolution and Growth of the Weak Signal to Maturity (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrmatur.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Coffman, B., Part V: A Process Model for Weak Signal Research (1997) Journal of Transition Management, , http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/winter97/wsrprocm.htm, MG Taylor Corporation; Blanco, S., Lesca, H., Environmental scanning: designing a collective learning process to track down weak signals (1997) Presentation in Actes de la 3e Conferénce de l'AIS Amérique (Association for Information Systems); Harris, D.D., Zeisler, S., Weak signals: detecting the next big thing (2002) The Futurist, 36 (6), pp. 21-29; Day, G., Schoemaker, P., Scanning the periphery (2005) Harvard Business Review, pp. 135-148. , November; Mendonça, S.S., e Cunha, M.P., Kaivo-oja, J., Ruff, F., Wild cards, weak signals and organizational improvisation (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 201-218; Mannermaa, M., Toolbox ja heikot signaalit (1999) Futura, 13 (2), pp. 32-37; Mannermaa, M., A Strong Future from Weak Signals (2004) Heikoista signaaleista vahva tulevaisuus, , WSOY, Porvoo; Hiltunen, E., Heikot signaalit - teoriakatsaus (2000) Futura, 14 (2), pp. 72-77; Hiltunen, E., Heikkojen signaalien käyttö yrityksissä (2001) Futura, 15 (1), pp. 45-50; Hiltunen, E., The future sign and its three dimensions (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 247-260; Kuusi, O., Hiltunen, E., Linturi, H., Heikot tulevaisuussignaalit - Delfoi tutkimus (2000) Futura, 14 (2), pp. 78-92; Nikander, I.O., Early warnings - a phenomenon in project management (2002), Dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Science in Technology, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Moijanen, M., Heikot signaalit tulevaisuuden tutkimuksessa (2003) Futura, 17 (4), pp. 38-60; Ilmola, L., Kuusi, O., Filters of weak signals hinder foresight: monitoring weak signals efficiently in corporate decision-making (2006) Futures, 38 (8), pp. 908-924; Uskali, T., Paying attention to weak signals - the key concept for innovation journalism (2005) Innovation Journalism, 2 (4), pp. 33-49; Brummer, V., Innovaatioaihioiden verkkopohjainen ideointi ja monikriteerinen seulonta (Internet based generation and multicriteria screening of innovation ideas) (2005), http://www.sal.hut.fi/Publications/pdffiles/TBRU05.pdf, MSc Thesis (Engineering), Department of Physics and Mathematics, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki; Kuosa, T., Heikko signaali vai merkityksetön kohina: Pattern management - ontologisesti uusi lähestymistapa heikkojen signaalien tarkasteluun ja tulkintaan (2005) Futura, 19 (4), pp. 115-120; e Cunha, M.P., Chia, R., Using teams to avoid peripheral blindness (2007) Long Range Planning, 40 (6), pp. 559-573; Kuosa, T., Futures signals sense-making framework (FSSF): a start-up tool to analyse and categorise weak signals, wild cards, drivers, trends and other types of information (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 42-48; Mendonca, S., Cunha, M.P.E., Ruff, F., Kaivo-oja, J., Venturing into the wilderness: preparing for wild cards in the civil aircraft and asset-management industries.

This extraordinary foresight has come to be known as Business Intelligence (BI), an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of activities and technologies involved in the process of collecting data, translating data into information, using information to guide and support decision making with the ultimate goal of enhancing corporate performance. As a forerunner in the field of Business Intelligence, FICO has been awarded more than 100 patents for its diverse products, among which FICO score and Falcon payment authorization system are used by millions of customers on a daily basis. This paper examines sixteen most recent patents that were awarded to Fair Isaac Corp between September 2010 and August 2011 in the area of Business Intelligence. Unlike traditional detailed patent reviews that are focused on at a specific topic involving multiple companies, we adopt a company-centered approach to achieve three specific contributions to the literature: 1) to provide concrete examples of how specific FICO patents have advanced the field of Business Intelligence; 2) to synchronize knowledge between academics and practitioners in terms of most urgent and practical issues facing the industry; and 3) to use these cutting-edge innovations to highlight current trends in the Business Intelligence field. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.","Credit scoring; Data preprocessing; Data visualization; Data warehousing; Fraud detection and prevention; Transaction data mining","Authorization systems; Business decisions; Business strategy; Corporate performance; Credit scoring; Current trends; Cutting edges; Data preprocessing; Fraud detection; Patent review; Practical issues; Transaction data; Data visualization; Data warehouses; Industry; Patents and inventions; Management science",,,,,"http://www.fico.com/en/Company/Pages/history.aspx, FICO History.

In this article, we propose a methodology to assess uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulations. Taking three different global change scenarios, we vary economic parameters liable to influence the future of agriculture within each scenario. The simulations are based on farming models developed for two French regions (Midi-Pyrénées and Alsace), using linear programming (LP). These are used to simulate the impacts of a "" business as usual"" , "" liberal"" and "" interventionist"" scenario, on water abstraction for irrigation (Neste basin) and on nitrate leaching into groundwater (Alsace). The simulations all predict a drop in farm income in both regions, with a stronger effect in the liberal scenario. Water consumed in the Neste basin increases a little (+0.3 to +3.7% in the interventionist scenario). A slight decrease of agricultural nitrate leaching is observed in Alsace, with nearly no difference between the averages for the three scenarios. Considering all Monte Carlo simulations the nitrate leaching should decrease between -28% and -43%, so uncertainty is not very important from the water planning and management point of view. However, the uncertainty on incomes is greater. A comparison between the Monte Carlo results and those from the deterministic approach demonstrates the value of taking uncertainties into account in foresight modelling exercises; and suggest that Monte Carlo associated to LP is a partial response to classical criticism addressed towards basic LP. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Global change; Linear programming; Monte Carlo; Uncertainty; Water","agricultural policy; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; farming system; global change; groundwater abstraction; income distribution; leaching; linear programing; Monte Carlo analysis; nitrate; trade-environment relations; uncertainty analysis; water planning; water resource; Alsace; France; Midi-Pyrenees",,,,,"Abildtrup, J., Audsley, E., Fekete-Farkas, M., Giupponi, C., Gylling, M., Rosato, P., Rounsevell, M., Socio-economic scenario development for the assessment of climate change impacts on agricultural land use: a pairwise comparison approach (2006) Environ.

Coldwaves will also continue to be challenging in the foreseeable future. Protecting people's health and wellbeing from the impacts of climate change is especially important for older people, as they are particularly vulnerable to climate-related hazards. In addition, the proportion of people aged 65 and over is projected to increase significantly. This paper addresses these issues through a discussion of our work to map variations across England in future hazards, vulnerability and risk. We explain how this mapping has been used to identify areas of the country where the built infrastructure serving the older age group might be most severely impacted by climate-related events over the next 20-30 years and where planning for adaptation and resilience is most urgently required. Based on a review of research on the links between extreme weather events and their impacts on older people's health and the care services on which they depend, we developed operational definitions of extreme weather-related hazards likely to place particular pressure on health and social care systems that are essential for older people's health and wellbeing. We consider ways to relate these to the latest climate projections for the 2030s from the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCP09); river and coastal flooding projections for the 2050s from the 2004 UK Government's Foresight Flood and Coastal Defence Project (Environment Agency, 2004); and demographic projections for 2031 produced by the Office for National Statistics, UK. The research highlights the complexity of undertaking future hazard and vulnerability assessments. Key challenges include: how to define future hazards associated with climate change; how to predict and interpret future socio-demographic conditions contributing to vulnerability; and how geographical variability in hazards and vulnerabilities may combine to produce risks at the local level. In contrast to a number of more local studies which have focused on the vulnerability of urban populations to the impact of climate change (particularly heatwaves), the findings highlight the potential vulnerability of older populations in more rural regions (often in coastal areas) to a range of extreme weather-related hazards in both the North and South of England. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Hazard assessment; Health care; Human health; Population ageing; Vulnerability assessment","adaptive management; aging population; climate change; elderly population; extreme event; hazard assessment; hazard management; health care; health impact; mapping; risk assessment; social impact; vulnerability; England; United Kingdom",,,,,"Ahern, M., Kovats, R.S., The health impacts of floods (2006) Flood events and health.

It also addresses the question of how time influences hindsight bias. It begins by briefly summarizing the three dominant methodological paradigms researchers have used to study hindsight judgments, considering the influence of time in relation to each of these dominant experimental approaches and highlighting relations between foresight (a priori prediction) and hindsight (a posteriori reconstruction) within each research paradigm. Then, it considers prevailing theoretical models of the processes that underlie the development of hindsight bias over time. It concludes by comparing and contrasting the role time plays within each mediational model, constructing an integrative temporal model and suggesting potentially fruitful avenues for future research on the role of time in the development of hindsight bias. © 2006 by Lawrence J.

The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 expanded and codified NCSES's role as a U.S. federal statistical agency. Important aspects of the agency's mandate include collection, acquisition, analysis, and reporting and dissemination of data on research and development trends, on U.S. competitiveness in science, technology, and research and development, and on the condition and progress of U.S. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Improving Measures of Science, Technology and Innovation: Interim Report examines the status of the NCSES's science, technology, and innovation (STI) indicators. This report assesses and provides recommendations regarding the need for revised, refocused, and newly developed indicators designed to better reflect fundamental and rapid changes that are reshaping global science, technology and innovation systems. The book also determines the international scope of STI indicators and the need for developing new indicators that measure developments in innovative activities in the United States and abroad, and Offers foresight on the types of data, metrics and indicators that will be particularly influential in evidentiary policy decision-making for years to come. In carrying out its charge, the authoring panel undertook a broad and comprehensive review of STI indicators from different countries, including Japan, China, India and several countries in Europe, Latin America and Africa. Improving Measures of Science, Technology, and Innovation makes recommendations for near-term action by NCSES along two dimensions: (1) development of new policy-relevant indicators that are based on NCSES survey data or on data collections at other statistical agencies; and (2) exploration of new data extraction and management tools for generating statistics, using automated methods of harvesting unstructured or scientometric data and data derived from administrative records. © 2012 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Participatory approaches in foresight studies, though, generate a large amount of qualitative data. In order to deal with this issue, there is a need for tools and techniques capable of handling qualitative data, so that the input to a foresight exercise can be enriched and value can be added to the outcome of the decision making process. The focus of the paper is on the introduction of qualitative data analysis tools for the processing of qualitative data that are gathered by use of participatory approaches in foresight exercises. In the first part it attempts to shed light on the intriguing issue of integrating 'narratives and numbers' in a participatory foresight context. In the second part it presents the application of the ATLAS-ti model - a qualitative data analysis tool - on the data obtained from the stakeholders' validation workshop, carried out in the context of the AG2020 project on the future of agriculture in Europe.

This article addresses the use of strategic foresight applied to the strategic management plan for an agency that deals with the funding and promotion for the development of science, technology and innovation in Brazil, and the logic that permeated its construction, promoting an alliance of the concepts of strategy and foresight. It has as key elements the long-term vision and the adoption of participatory approach and qualitative and quantitative methods. The methodological framework involved the use of different techniques, methods and tools, including, among others, web survey, diagnosis, SWOT, future timeline, interviews, workshops and strategic roadmap. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","FINEP; funding and promotion agency; innovation; strategic foresight; strategic management plan","decision making; innovation; participatory approach; private sector; public sector; science and technology; strategic approach; technological development; technology adoption; Brazil",,,,,"Andrews, K.R., The concept of corporate strategy (1998) The strategy process, pp. 51-60. , In: Mintzberg H., Quinn J.

Based on an in-depth and multiple study of several companies, we analyse the main characteristics of environmental uncertainty - complexity and dynamism - that shape companies' approaches to strategic foresight and uncertainty management. We explore the impact of growing complexity and dynamism on these approaches and the role of prediction and control in their design and implementation. We outline a conceptual framework for strategic foresight activities - and their relationships with decision making under uncertainty - as a planned learning process about the future which enables managers not to know opportunities and threats in advance, but to detect them more promptly and to react more effectively as soon as they start emerging. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Learning; Planning; Strategic decision making; Strategic foresight; Uncertainty","Conceptual frameworks; Decision making under uncertainty; Environmental uncertainty; Learning; Learning process; Main characteristics; Prediction and control; Strategic decision making; Strategic foresight; Uncertainty; Uncertainty management; Industry; Planning; Uncertainty analysis; conceptual framework; decision making; design; prediction; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Grant, R.M., Strategic Planning in a Turbulent Environment: Evidence from the oil majors (2003) Strateg.

Recognizing this need, the paper begins with the introduction of the Systemic Foresight Methodology (SFM) is introduced briefly as a conceptual framework to understand and appreciate the complexity of systems and interdependencies and interrelationships between their elements. Conducting Foresight systemically involves a set of 'systemic' thought experiments, which is about how systems (e.g. human and social systems, industrial/sectoral systems, and innovation systems) are understood, modelled and intervened for a successful change programme. A methodological approach is proposed with the use of network analysis to show an application of systemic thinking in Foresight through the visualisation of interrelationships and interdependencies between trends, issues and actors, and their interpretation to explain the evolution of systems. Network analysis is a powerful approach as it is able to analyse both the whole system of relations and parts of the system at the same time and hence it reveals the otherwise hidden structural properties of the systems. Our earlier work has attempted to incorporate network analysis in Foresight, which helped to reveal structural linkages of trends and identify emerging important trends in the future. Following from this work, in this paper we combine systemic Foresight, network analysis and scenario methods to propose an 'Evolutionary Scenario Approach,' which explains the ways in which the future may unfold based on the mapping of the gradual change and the dynamics of aspects or variables that characterise a series of circumstances in a period of time. Thus, not only are evolutionary scenarios capable of giving a snapshot of a particular future, but also explaining the emerging transformation pathways of events and situations from the present into the future as systemic narratives. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Big picture survey; Evolutionary scenarios; Network analysis; Scanning; Scenarios; Systemic Foresight","Conceptual frameworks; Evolutionary scenarios; Gradual changes; Innovation system; Methodological approach; Scenario approach; Scenarios; Social systems; Systemic approach; Systemic Foresight; Systemic thinking; Thought experiments; Transformation pathways; Value systems; Electric network analysis; Scanning; Visualization; Time series analysis; conceptual framework; mapping; methodology; network analysis",,,,,"Saritas, O., (2006), Systems Thinking for Foresight, PhD thesis for PREST, The University of Manchester; Loveridge, D., Saritas, O., Reducing the democratic deficit in institutional foresight programmes: a case for critical systems thinking in nanotechnology (2009) Technol.

A two-step compilation of the opinions of a large number of experts, based on technology foresight methods, is used to define directions for technological advancement and assess the probability of success in each area. The life cycle assessment method is used to quantify the impacts of the expected changes in agricultural production technologies across a wide range of environmental impact categories. Based on case studies of tomato, potato and citrus crop production in Israel, we conclude that technological improvements addressing the use of fertilisers and packing materials show the greatest potential to reduce the environmental impacts. We also conclude that agricultural research on field-grown crops should focus on increasing the yield per hectare, and research on greenhouse grown crops should focus on reducing the impact of the materials used in covering the greenhouse.

Four niches are described: initiating and achieving 'sustainability transitions'; industry adaptation and transformation strategies; governing emerging technologies to enable responsible innovation; and experimentation with planning and policy-making approaches for more uncertain futures (e.g. in climate change adaptation). Intervention by foresight practitioners in such developing niches is recommended. In doing so, the paper also outlines: 1) the rapidly evolving social context for applied foresight work; and 2) emerging methodological approaches, and associated action frameworks combining futures methods with prescriptions for interventionist actions, which are being developed. These approaches are argued to be responses to the increasing problematisation of the future generated by climate change and other important wicked problems. Such changes also make visible a potential shift away from technocratic, or 'modernist', styles of planning and policy towards a new 'anticipatory interventionist paradigm'.","Applied foresight; Emerging technologies; Governance models; Sustainability; Systemic inquiry and change; Transitions",,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Brown, K., Vulnerability and Resilience to Environmental Change: Ecological and Social Perspectives (2009) A Companion to Environmental Geography, , N.

The expectation is that ELSI research will produce a practical advanced assessment of the impacts of technological development. Williams' overview of the field demonstrates that this encourages a mechanistic understanding of technological development leading to compressed foresight, i.e. the notion that the future is imminent in the present. The development of the ELSI domain in Canada has been characterised by an affinity between the types of knowledge valorised by the field and modes of legal reasoning, suggesting a legal variant of compressed foresight. The concept of juridification and an analysis of two related modes of legal reasoning (analogy and reflective equilibrium) shed light on the connection between legal reasoning and the ELSI field in Canada. The deployment of the aforementioned modes of legal reasoning enables law to define and operationalise difficult questions by drawing on currently existing principles and precedents. Thus, when legal modes of reasoning are brought to bear on ELSI questions, the future is made a calculable and manageable extension of the present, dovetailing with the ELSI field's requirement of pragmatic, advanced assessment. © 2012 Process Press.","analogy; compressed foresight; ELSI; juridification; legal modes of reasoning; reflective equilibrium",,,,,,"Arthurs, H.W., Kreklewich, R., Law, legal institutions, and the legal profession in the new economy (1996) Osgoode Hall Law Journal, 34 (1), pp. 1-60; Beauchamp, T.L., Childress, J.F., (2001) Principles of Biomedical Ethics, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Beer, W.M., Jansen, A.J.A., (2004) Ethical Legal and Societal Aspects of Genomics Research in the EU, Canada and the US, , http://www.genomics.nl/resources/Documents/Int_initiatives/Inventory_ELSA_final.pdf, (European Commission [online].

It explores which of the original purposes and assumptions have stood the test of time over the course of a decade and analyses how the course has evolved, partly through design and partly through necessity. The paper reflects on the primary contribution of the Masters teaching experience and proposes that encouraging the students to develop philosophical 'literacy' operated to develop both the practicality of their use of methods and the capacity of their leadership and critical thinking. A secondary contribution reiterates the importance of 'place' and the necessity of 'sufficient time' for adult development to occur. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"education; educational development; literacy; philosophy; student; teaching; Australia",,,,,"Slaughter, R.A., Road testing a new model at the Australian Foresight Institute (2004) Futures, 36 (8), pp. 837-852; Slaughter, R.A., (2010) The Biggest Wake up Call in History, , Foresight International, Indooroopilly (Brisbane), Australia; Voros, J., A generic foresight process framework (2003) Foresight, 5 (3), pp. 10-21; Wilber, K., (2000), 5-8. , The Collected Works of Ken Wilber, vol. 8, Shambhala Pubs., Boston, 1999-2000. vol. 1-4 publ. 1999;; Wilber, K., (2000) Integral Psychology: Consciousness, Spirit, Psychology, Therapy, , Shambhala Pubs, Boston; Wilber, K., (2000) A Theory of Everything: An Integral Vision for Business, Politics, Science and Spirituality, , Shambhala Pubs, Boston; Wilber, K., (2007) The Integral Vision: A Very Short Introduction to the Revolutionary Integral Approach to Life, God, the Universe, and Everything, , Shambhala Pubs, Boston; Wilber, K., Fuhs, C., (2009), http://www.coreintegral.com/, The Integral Approach: Course 01: Essential Integral [Audio-Visual Material], 8 DVDs, Core Integral/Integral Life, Boulder, CO; Voros, J., Reframing environmental scanning: an integral approach (2001) Foresight, 3 (6), pp. 533-552; Voros, J., (2003), (Ed.), Reframing Environmental Scanning: a reader on the art of scanning the environment, Australian Foresight Institute Monograph Series, No. 4, Swinburne University Press, Melbourne; Voros, J., A generalised "" layered methodology"" framework (2005) Foresight, 7 (2), pp. 28-40; Voros, J., Introducing a classification framework for prospective methods (2006) Foresight, 8 (2), pp. 43-56; Voros, J., Nesting social-analytical perspectives: an approach to macro-social analysis (2006) Journal of Futures Studies, 11 (1), pp. 1-21; Voros, J., Macro-perspectives beyond the world system (2007) Journal of Futures Studies, 11 (3), pp. 1-28; Voros, J., Morphological prospection: profiling the shapes of things to come (2009) Foresight, 11 (6), pp. 4-20; Kuhn, T.S., (1996) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Michael, D.N., With both feet planted firmly in mid-air: reflections on thinking about the future (1985) Futures, 17 (2), pp. 94-103; Einstein, A., Letter to R.A.

The inherent complexity and uncertainty of real world urge many experts to be involved in decision-making processes. This paper presents an application of the linguistic-label aggregation method in a real-life case study. The case was taken from a foresight exercise in Colombia (South America) concerning environmental and water resources planning in a river basin. The group decision-making problem is solved using a four-step approach based on (i) the evaluation of experts' opinions, (ii) the aggregation of opinions for each alternative, (iii) fuzzy ranking, and (iv) final assessment. Two main issues that are new in our work is that we consider temporal linguistic labels and a fuzzy ranking procedure that is able to include the mean, the standard deviation, the fuzzy membership function and the frequency of experts' opinions for each alternative. The approach is developed and implemented on a computational tool. Results show an efficient decision-making process, that is, the tool demonstrated to deal with shortest time frames and to increase the efficiency of the planning resources, mainly because allows the decision manager to focus on the establishment of criteria. The latter also leads to objectivity and eases the identification and discussion of elements of consensus in decisions that otherwise may be embedded in individuals' interests. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Case study;

Individuals have myopic foresight, and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) public pensions exist. Although large PAYG transfers may cause endogenous fluctuations in both contexts, cyclical instability and deterministic chaos more likely occur when fertility is an economic decision variable. We find that the existence of endogenous fertility and PAYG pensions can explain the occurrence of demographic oscillations that mimic the baby boom and baby bust, in contrast with the unrealistic case of constant population, and also economic cycles. We also show that an increase in the social security contribution rate under endogenous fertility, often advocated as a remedy against the crisis of public pension budgets, may prolong both the phases and size of demographic (economic) cycles around a lower (higher) long-run level of population growth (income per worker) than under exogenous fertility. © SAGE Publications 2012.","demoeconomic fluctuations; myopic foresight; OLG model; PAYG pensions; stability",,,,,,"Barro, R.J., Becker Gary, S., Fertility Choice in a Model of Economic Growth (1989) Econometrica, 57, pp. 481-501; Becker, G.S., (1960) Demographic and Economic Change in Developing Countries, pp. 225-256. , edited by National Bureau Committee for Economic Research, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Becker, G.S., Barro, R.J., A Reformulation of the Economic Theory of Fertility (1988) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 103, pp. 1-25; Becker, G.S., Gregg Lewis, H., On the Interaction between the Quantity and Quality of Children (1973) Journal of Political Economy, 81, pp. S279-S288; Becker, G.S., Tomes, N., Child Endowments and the Quantity and Quality of Children (1976) Journal of Political Economy, 84, pp. S143-S162; Becker, G.S., Murphy, K.M., Tamura, R., Human Capital, Fertility and Economic Growth (1990) Journal of Political Economy, 98, pp. S12-S37; Boldrin, M., Jones, L.E., Mortality, Fertility and Saving in a Malthusian Economy (2002) Review of Economic Dynamics, 5, pp. 775-814; Chen, H.-J., Li, M.-C., Lin, Y.-J., Chaotic Dynamics in an Overlapping Generations Model with Myopic and Adaptive Expectations (2008) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 67, pp. 48-56; Cigno, A., Low Fertility in Europe: Is the Pension System the Victim or the Culprit?

Applying the methodology of Foresight we emphasize the cognitive and debating stages of developing a longer term vision and the framing of an aspirational scenario of a learning intensive society. Based on input from the Nordic higher education institution (HEI) policy experts, an image - acronymed SMARTT - for the next 15-20 years, encompassing Science, Mobility, Advancement, Research and Technology Transfer, is presented. The paper emphasizes the stages of the foresighting process, including both the development of mini-scenarios and backcasting, by analyzing the interplay between HEIs and their swiftly changing environments and futures. The concrete process steps are also related to the contemporary discourse on the relations between theories of path dependency, path breaking and path creation.","Foresight; Futures studies; Higher education policy building; Sociology of knowledge Journal; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Djelic, M.-L., Quack, S., Overcoming path dependency: Path generation in open systems (2007) Theory and Society, 36 (2), pp. 161-186; Dreborg, K., Essence of backcasting (1996) Futures, 28 (9), pp. 813-828; De Jouvenel, H., Futuribles: Ein Gesamtkonzept der Zukunftsforsc-hung (2000) Zukunftsforschung in Europa.

Moreover, although the future cannot be predicted, it is clear that certain decisions/actions can influence the future in desired directions. In this respect, planners are being challenged to focus on the development of new approaches and tools, capable of dealing with complexity and uncertainty, in order to be able to effectively support policy makers in making more knowledgeable decisions to achieve desirable future outcomes. The focus of the present paper is on the development of such an approach, i.e., a backcasting policy-scenario design approach, used for the study of the future developments in EU agriculture in 2020. In this respect, the paper presents the main stream of methodological approaches for scenario building, i.e., forecasting and backcasting approaches; it elaborates on the steps involved in the backcasting policy-scenario design framework; and it follows these steps by adopting the backcasting policy-scenario design framework in the AG2020 EU project on the future of EU agriculture in 2020.

The specific kind of relation that is explored has similarities with the sticky-information Phillips curve of the Mankiw-Reis framework. Nevertheless, it adds an important dimension: firms need to form expectations about current events on past time periods not because of infrequent optimal updating of information but because producers want to evaluate the possibility of taking advantage of information deficiencies on the consumers' side. A positive probability of 'fooling' consumers with a price above the one imposed by market conditions re-shapes the dynamic relation between the inflation rate and the output gap. © 2011 University of Venice.","Bounded rationality; Information acquisition; Monetary policy; Perfect foresight; Phillips curve; Stability analysis; Thought experimentation",,,,,,"Alvarez, L., What do micro price data tell us on the validity of the New Keynesian Phillips curve?

One framework for these activities is anticipatory governance, in which foresight and public and stakeholder engagement are used to reflect on - and direct - the impacts of new technology. In this essay we draw on our experience of anticipatory governance, in the shape of the "" NanoFutures"" project on energy futures, to present a reflexive analysis of engagement and deliberation. We draw out five tensions of the practice of deliberation on energy technologies. Through tracing the lineages of these dilemmas, we discuss some of the implications of these tensions for the practice of civic engagement and deliberation in a set of questions for this community of practitioner-scholars. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Anticipatory Governance; Deliberation; Energy; Nanotechnology; Public Participation; Reflexivity",,,,,,"Abrahamse, W., Steg, L., Vlek, C., Rothengatter, T., A review of intervention studies aimed at household energy conservation (2005) Journal of Environmental Psychology, 25 (3), pp. 273-291. , DOI 10.1016/j.jenvp.2005.08.002, PII S027249440500054X; Aitken, M., Wind power planning controversies and the construction of 'expert' and 'lay' knowledges (2009) Science as Culture, 18 (1), pp. 47-64; Barben, D., Fisher, E., Selin, C., Guston, D.H., Anticipatory governance of nanotechnology: Foresight, engagement, and integration (2008) The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies, pp. 979-1000. , In E.J.

Today, the benefits of considerable public investments and the foresight of a visionary mayor transformed the neighbourhood into a walkable urban neighbourhood and business centre, well on its way to its maturation as a vibrant riverfront destination in the nation's capital.

We outline developments in the areas of robot applications for assisting the elderly and their carers, for monitoring their health and safety, and for providing them with companionship. Despite the possible benefits, we raise and discuss six main ethical concerns associated with: (1) the potential reduction in the amount of human contact; (2) an increase in the feelings of objectification and loss of control; (3) a loss of privacy; (4) a loss of personal liberty; (5) deception and infantilisation; (6) the circumstances in which elderly people should be allowed to control robots. We conclude by balancing the care benefits against the ethical costs. If introduced with foresight and careful guidelines, robots and robotic technology could improve the lives of the elderly, reducing their dependence, and creating more opportunities for social interaction. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Assistive robotics; Companion; Elder care; Elderly; Guidelines; Robot; Surveillance",,,,,,"Allen, C., Wallach, W., Smit, I., Why machine ethics?

Indigenous strategies and interventions need to be developed that cater for the psychosocial needs of South African youth living with HIV/AIDS. By using Participatory Action Research (PAR) a Cognitive-behavioural-based Counselling Intervention Programme (CBCIP) was developed for use in a rural South African town. This article discusses the participatory action process involved in the development of the CBCIP. It shows how PAR theory relates to practice by highlighting the benefits, challenges and caveats in applying PAR within a rural setting. The lessons that were learned in the development of the CBCIP may provide future researchers with useful insight and foresight in the development of HIV counselling interventions for young people living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","CBT;

This chapter will review the literature on trait impulsivity from a developmental perspective. The nomenclature of impulsivity varies widely, with definitions range from behaving with lack of foresight to novelty seeking. We provide a review of the multi-faceted model of impulsivity including negative urgency, (lack of) premeditation, sensation seeking, and (lack of) perseverance (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001), and how these four facets of impulsivity may be related to childhood temperament and thus to the development of eating pathology in children and adolescents. A review of the interaction between temperament and environment will also be provided. In large scale genetic studies, shared environment appears to contribute to risk for eating pathology prior to puberty, which genetic influences and non-shared environment contribute to risk following puberty. We propose that increased vulnerability to maladaptive behaviors develops from high levels of negative urgency. We also describe a process by which an adolescent's environment shapes their expectancies, which can in turn influence decision making, which may be moderated by high levels of negative urgency. Finally, we propose that negative urgency is plausible endophentype candidate for the heritable genetic influence on BN expressed after puberty, while thinness expectancies may capture shared and non-shared environmental influences. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Thus, a risk assessment system is required for (a) preventing accidents by anticipation, (b) surviving disturbances by recovery, and (c) handling disruptive events by adaptation. RE is a proactive approach claiming to achieve all these objectives. The present research tries to identify challenges in the procedure of building RE and its adaptive capacity in a chemical plant. Primary data were collected through on-site observations and interviewing personnel. The results indicated the main challenges could be classified into nine categories of: lack of explicit experience about RE, intangibility of RE level, choosing production over safety, lack of reporting systems, 'religious beliefs', out-of-date procedures and manuals, poor feedback loop, and economic problems. Finally, it is concluded that the management insight about safety in such systems should avoid hindsight bias and tend to create foresight. Changing this insight can lead to achieve high reliability and resilience in the plant. © 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The main questions asked are: why and how can a strong external financial orientation lead to amplified external shocks in a small open economy; and whether the shocks could have been better absorbed or dampened with some foresight? Our answer is in the affirmative as we indicate that the dangers of extended foreign currency exposure were known from the literature and from other small countries' experience. However, we argue that for Hungary a fully effective defence, let alone full absorption of the shocks, was not possible by any measure; nor was it offered by any known policy measures of standard theories. The article outlines the general world economic conditions during the crisis period and follows with Hungary-specific features and vulnerabilities in order to identify crucial points of crisis management and economic policy formation. Data series cover 2004-10, with expectations for 2011. This six-year period represents Hungary's economic development path after EU accession. We demonstrate that the capacity of a non-eurozone small open economy for external shock absorbing, and for applying standard crisis-dampening instruments, fiscal or monetary, was very limited. Successful external shock absorption, with large foreign debt exposure, is more challenging than the profession or the general public might think. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"crisis management; currency; economic conditions; economic development; economic policy; European Union; global economy; vulnerability; Hungary",,,,,"Begg, P., Fisher, S., Dornbusch, R., (2000) Economics, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Blanchard, O.J., The state of macroeconomics (2008) NBER working paper, (1425). , August; Blanchard, O.J., Cottanelli, C., Splimbergo, A., Symanski, S., (2009) Fiscal Policy for the Crisis, , Social Science Research Network, SSRN, abstract/paper id =1339442; Blinder, A.S., Crazy compensation and the crisis (2009) The Wall Street journal, pp. A17. , 28 May; Fernandez-Villaverde, J., Risk matters: the real effects of volatility shocks (2009) NBER working paper, , no. 14875, Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research; Golub, H., Getting out of the credit mess (2008) The Wall Street journal, pp. A17. , 9 December; Griffith-Jones, S., Ocampo, J., The financial crisis and its impact on developing countries (2009) International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth, Working Paper, (53), pp. 3-4; Gros, D., Collapse in Eastern Europe?

Potentially, a key technology for leading the transition from the current fossil fuel-dominated energy system to a more sustainable one is carbon dioxide capture and storage. Uncertainties exist, however, concerning the large-scale implementability of this technology, such as related to the regional availability of storage sites for the captured CO 2 . We analyze these uncertainties from an integrated assessment perspective by using the bottom-up model TIAM-ECN and by studying a set of scenarios that cover a range of different climate targets and technology futures. Our study consists of two main approaches: (1) a sensitivity analysis through the investigation of a number of scenarios under perfect foresight decision making and (2) a stochastic programming exercise that allows for simultaneously considering a set of potential future states-of-the-world. We find that, if a stringent climate (forcing) target is a possibility, it dominates the solution: if deep CO 2 emission reductions are not started as soon as possible, the target may become unreachable. Attaining a stringent climate target comes in any case at a disproportionally high price, which indicates that adaptation measures or climate damages might be preferable to the high mitigation costs such a target implies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS); Climate change; Energy system modeling; Mitigation target; Storage potential; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Deffeyes, K.S., (2005) Beyond oil: The view from Hubbert's peak, , Farrar, Straus & Giroux; Forest, C.E., Stone, P.H., Sokolov, A., Allen, M.R., Webster, M.D., Quantifying uncertainties in climate system properties with the use of recent climate observations (2002) Science, 295 (5552), pp. 113-117; Fuss, S., Szolgayova, W., Obersteiner, M., Gusti, M., Investment under market and climate policy uncertainty (2008) Applied Energy, 85 (8), pp. 708-721; (2011), GEA, Global Energy Assessment, IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria, forthcoming; Gerlagh, R., van der Zwaan, B., Options and Instruments for a deep cut in CO 2 emissions: Carbon dioxide capture or renewables, taxes or subsidies?

Since the early 1980s, the South African forest industry has obtained genetic material of 25 pine and eucalypt species that represent more than 4 200 trees from 260 natural populations around the world through its participation in Camcore (International Tree Breeding and Conservation Program) at North Carolina State University, USA. This combined genetic testing and conservation program has identified new productive pine species, such as P. tecunumanii and P. maximinoi, that grow well and are resistant in the seedling stage to the pitch canker fungus (Fusarium circinatum). Because of the industry's foresight to assemble genetic material and test alternate species over the last three decades, it was well prepared to immediately develop more-resistant pine hybrids such as P. patula × P. tecunumanii when the pitch canker situation became problematic. The South African forest industry has collectively worked together to established special 20-40 ha conservation parks across the country to hold and protect the original genetic material collected in Central America, Mexico and South-east Asia. Species are conserved in the parks at the population level and are represented by a minimum of 10 open-pollinated families, five trees per family across two sites. The design is based on maintaining an effective population size of approximately 30 with the goal to capture alleles at high frequencies as well as to include a number of rare alleles in the ex situ plantings. The overlying goal is to maintain well-adapted genetic material for future deployment. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.","adaptability; climate change; ex situ conservation","Fungi; Fusarium; Gibberella circinata;

The aim of this study is that the basic process provides foresights into EOT and leakage-current density requirements. We chose rutile-TiO 2 for the insulators to meet the requirement of relative permittivity and Ru to suppress leakage-current density. We found the as-deposited lower electrode of Ru crystallized into the rutile phase of TiO 2 with a relative permittivity of 109 due to the similarity of crystal structures and lattice constants between rutile-TiO 2 and rutile-RuO 2 , which was generated by oxidizing Ru with ambient oxygen. Furthermore, we confirmed that doping elements that had a small-ionic radius, such as Co, decreased leakage-current density. The dependence of the leakage current of Ru/Co-doped-TiO 2 /Ru capacitors on temperature and analysis of the band structure with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that leakage-current density is determined by a balance between thermionic current and tunneling current through the Schottky barrier. Through calculations using a theoretical equation for these currents, the optimum percentage of Co was estimated to range from 0.3-0.6 % to meet requirement of leakage current for 20 nm- DRAMs. © 2011 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Ambient oxygen; Band engineering; Doping elements; Leakage current densitys; Relative permittivity; Rutile phase; Schottky barriers; Theoretical equation; Thermionic currents; TiO; Tunneling current; Capacitors; Cobalt; Current density; Leakage currents; Oxide minerals; Permittivity; Ruthenium compounds; Schottky barrier diodes; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoelectrons; Titanium dioxide",,,,,"(2010), International Technology Roadmafor Semiconductor 2010 update, front end process, DRAM Stacked Capacitor Technology Requirements; Kwon, O.S., Kim, S.K., Cho, M., Hwang, C.S., Jeong, J., Chemically conformal ALD of SrTiO 3 thin films using conventional metallorganic precursors (2005) Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 152 (4), pp. C229-C236. , DOI 10.1149/1.1869292; Robertson, J., (2000) J.

The need to identify direct impacts, measure them and identify the factors that lead to impact is the primary objective of the special issue and, as outlined in the article, represents a critical addition to the foresight field. On the basis of case studies, experience, and theoreticalevaluative frameworks this issue seels to offer suggestions regarding the factors that may help policy makers, academics, consultants, and others involved in foresight produce impactful results. The methodology deployed for this article is both empirical and meta analysis. This introductory article is based on the special issue articles as well as the authors' extensive practical experiences in foresight. Foresight does impact policy. Case studies and experiences in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia identified in the special issue provide support for this. Also, as difficult as it is to measure impact, the authors explore several frameworks that will help the foresight community demonstrate impact and prove the value of foresight.

Hence, the legal environmental protection also requires ethical and economic elements that are derived from the precautionary principle. Its assessment should always be interpreted in the context of the cultural changes taking place to promote new aims and values. Because of that, nowadays legal environment protection is combined with the principle of sustainable development, which requires foresight in anticipating the possible consequences of human activities. Given the intensive development of technologies based on the use of living biological systems, the issues of intergenerational justice are complicated. Sustainable development policy, solving problems of resource use and taking into account the integrity of the nature's various elements, requires education and development of environmental ethics which should be understood as restrictive ethics, i.e. the choice and willingness not to abuse available resources. This ethics consists of accountability and respect for future generations which also have the right to inherit the environment that fits for life and that provides opportunities for development.","Accountability; International environmental law; Justice; Protection of life environment; Sustainable development",,,,,,"Arangio Ruiz, V., (1994) Istituzioni Di Diritto Romano, , wyd. 14, Jovene Napoli; Bartolommei, S., (1993) Le Generazioni Future Fra Ragione E Immaginazione, In: Questioni Di Ioetica, Red, pp. 242-250. , Rodotà S., Bari; Białek, E., Edukacja dla zrówno-ważonego rozwoju, in: Problemy Ekorozwoju (2007) Problems of Sustainable Development, 2, pp. 67-73; Birnbacher, D., (1999) Odpowiedzialność Za Przy-szłe Pokolenia, , Oficyna Naukowa, Warszawa; Bochenek, K., Niektóre aspekty zrównoważonego rozwoju w świetle chrześcijańskiej filozofii średniowiecznej, in: Problemy Ekorozwoju (2010) Problems of Sustainable Development, 5 (1), pp. 71-79; Bonfante, P., (1966) Corso Di Diritto Romano, 2. , Giuffrè, Milano; Borys, T., Zrównoważony rozwój - jak rozpoznać ład zintegrowany (2011) Problemy Ekorozwoju/Problems of Sustainable Development, 6 (2), pp. 75-81; Bresso, F., (1982) Pensiero Economico E Ambiente, , Loescher Editore, Torino; Burdese, A., (1964) Manuale Di Diritto Privato Romano, , UTET, Torino; Compagnoni, F., (1995) Perseverare Il Mondo Perché È Di Tutti, pp. 85-97. , in: Per un'etica dell'ambiente, red.

The aim of the paper is to provide a benchmark for UK manufacturing industry to work from, after which future measuring instruments could be employed to track whether companies are meeting these challenges. A survey into 100 UK manufacturing companies provides the basis for the identification of the challenges and KDAs. The findings from the survey are analysed against information obtained from existing strategy reports and foresight papers/studies to reach a point where the authors identify a balanced set of challenges and developmental areas obtained from this mixed research approach. Through a comprehensive academic and industrial study, the authors identify and propose nine key manufacturing challenges for UK manufacturing industry to consider. Furthermore, the authors also identify a number of the KDAs which could be used to assist companies in meeting these challenges. The KDAs are not meant to be exhaustive but aimed to provide the underpinning support to the challenges proposed. The paper proposes a set of key manufacturing challenges for UK manufacturing businesses to consider and apply appropriate technologies and systems to achieve business resilience. This paper will therefore be of benefit to the academic community in that it distils a wide range of academic theory and industrial practice in order to create a coherent body of knowledge. As with any survey work, the accuracy of information depends largely on the size of the survey. Whilst 100 companies were surveyed, a further extension to this number would always help to strengthen future research. The identification of these key manufacturing challenges and their corresponding technologies, systems and paradigms is aimed at providing a new manufacturing perspective to both academics and industrialists. The challenges and developmental areas proposed provide the basis for a new and advanced manufacturing strategy to be developed for UK companies which aims to create economically sustainable manufacturing organisations. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Economic sustainability; Industry competitiveness; Key developmental areas; Manufacturing challenges; Manufacturing industries; Strategy; United Kingdom","Economic sustainability; Key developmental areas; Manufacturing challenges; Manufacturing industries; Strategy; United kingdom; Competition; Education; Industry; Manufacture; Surveys; Industrial research",,,,,"Adelson, M., Aroni, S., Differential images of the future (1975) The Delphi Method: Techniques and Applications, pp. 433-462. , in Linstone, H. and Turoff, M.

The schema is designed to guide foresight practitioners in the more effective design and conduct of foresight exercises to optimise impact. Design/methodology/approach: The development of the schema is based on the significant previous work in this field, and the author's experience of designing and managing more than 100 foresight projects. It also takes into account accumulated experience with heuristics developed to guide foresight design and management, and with various approaches to evaluating the impact of social science knowledge on policy-and decision-making. Findings: A range of impacts identified from major foresight projects have been characterised according to four categories of impact - awareness raising, informing policy, enabling greater capacity to address uncertainty, and influencing policy, strategy, investment, program delivery and public attitudes. Research limitations/implications: The schema needs to be tested against a variety of foresight projects to further refine its usefulness. Practical implications: With the rapid growth of the application of foresight, it has become essential to guide practitioners in the appropriate design and management of all the processes associated with foresight to achieve maximum impact, and to demonstrate the value of the investment in foresight to consequent policy and planning. Originality/value: This paper builds on earlier and contemporary work to develop a more refined and applicable schema to guide foresight impact evaluation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Evaluation; Foresight; Framework; Impact; Investments; Uncertainty management",,,,,,"Cagnin, C., Johnston, R., The influence of future-oriented technology analysis: Addressing the Cassandra challenge (2011) Futures, , accepted for publication; Calof, J., Smith, J., (2008) Critical success factors for government-led foresight, , http://forera.jrc.ec.europa.eu/fta_2008/prog_day1.html, paper presented at Future-Oriented Technology Analysis International Conference, Seville, October, available at; Calof, J., Smith, J., Critical success factors for government-led foresight (2010) Science and Public Policy, 37 (1), pp. 31-40. , February; Cozzens, S.E., The knowledge pool: Measurement challenges in evaluating fundamental research programs (1997) Evaluation and Program Planning, 20 (1), pp. 77-89; da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: Insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 20 (3), pp. 369-387. , May; (2009) Taking stock: A summary of ESRC's work to evaluate the impact of research on policy and practice, , www.esrc.ac.uk/impacts-and-findings/impact-assessment/developing-impact-evaluation.aspx, ESRC, February, available at; Georghiou, L., Third generation foresight - integrating the socio-economic dimension (2001) Proceedings of the International Conference on Technology Foresight.

The implications of this perspective for evaluating the outcomes of such programmes are to be explored. Design/methodology/approach: The range of activities comprising foresight is reviewed, along with the various objectives that may underpin these activities. The more substantial foresight programmes are seen in terms of a series of steps, in each of which various partners can be involved in generating service outcomes and later steps of the process. The arguments are illustrated with insights drawn from various cases. Findings: A foresight programme is likely to feed into more than one policy process, so that the foresight activities can be linked to various stages of the policy cycles, as well as engaging participants with different degrees of influence on the policies in question. The outcomes of the foresight activity are also heavily shaped by the degree of involvement of various stakeholders, not least the sponsoring agency and any other groups it seeks to mobilise. Seeing foresight as a service activity brings to the fore the notion of co-production, and the importance of the design of the service encounters involved. Research limitations/implications: The task of evaluating foresight is a challenging one, and comparison of foresight activities needs to bear in mind the different scale, scope, and ambitions of different programmes. Simple static comparison of formal inputs and outputs will miss much of the value and value-added of the activity. Practical implications: A dynamic approach to evaluation stresses the learning of lessons about the roles of multiple stakeholders - and the responsibilities of sponsors as well as practitioners. Originality/value: Foresight programmes are frequently commissioned, and often have significant influence on decision-making.

A key element of this Foresight is that S&T is now expected to indicate solutions for broad social issues and global issues (climate change, etc.) including those that address Japan's most urgent challenges (e.g. energy, aging population). This mission-oriented foresight is novel for the Japanese, since prior foresight exercises have been done with a technology focus. This paper aims to address how the new view of foresight - as more than mere technical potentials - has resulted in several types of foresight impacts, which are noted in the main text. Design/methodology/approach: The 9th Delphi Survey involved two types of interdisciplinary perspectives related to Japan's social future (Safe, Secure, Cooperation and Collaboration) and 12 S&T fields. The committees discussed what could emerge within 30 years and involved 26 domains of social expertise and 140 specialists. Findings: The 9th S&T Foresight investigation consists of an integration of three foresight methods - Delphi survey, scenario writing, and capability of local regions for green innovation - regarding sustainable development. Each method provides clear messages, and has unique impacts. Originality/value: Overall, a major foresight impact has been to enable a broader view of innovation to prevail in this ninth foresight, where social-scenario insights and more socially adaptive policies complement the traditional S&T focus developed by Delphi surveys 1-8. This shifted the policy discourse toward societal innovation from technical innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Delphi method; Delphi survey; Forecasting; Foresight; Japan; Scenario; Science and technology policy",,,,,,"Aichholzer, G., The Austrian foresight program: Organization and expert profile (2001) International Journal of Technology Management, 21 (7-8), pp. 739-755; Al-Saleh, Y.M., Vidican, G., Natarajan, L., Theeyattuparampil, V.V., Carbon capture, utilisation and storage scenarios for the Gulf Cooperation Council region: A Delphi-based foresight study (2012) Futures, 44 (1), pp. 105-115; Biloslavo, R., Dolinšek, S., Scenario planning for climate strategies development by integrating group Delphi, AHP and dynamic fuzzy cognitive maps (2010) Foresight, 12 (2), pp. 38-48; Celiktas, M.S., Kocar, G., From potential forecast to foresight of Turkey's renewable energy with Delphi approach (2010) Energy, 35 (5), pp. 1973-1980; Celiktas, M.S., Kocar, G., Foresight analysis of wind power in Turkey (2011) International Journal of Energy Research; Cuhls, K., Foresight with Delphi surveys in Japan (2001) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 13 (4), pp. 555-569; Czaplicka-Kolarz, K., Stańczyk, K., Kapusta, K., Technology foresight for a vision of energy sector development in Poland till 2030.

This paper aims to give a first overview of the authors' research on immediate learning and networking in the context of foresight. The paper seeks to introduce a practical concept for an accompanying social research of a participatory foresight process for empirically identifying and mapping impacts; and to present empirical results from the study of a specific foresight process. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply three approaches to analyze impacts. Accordingly data were gathered in moderated workshops for process analysis; structured telephone interviews for qualitative analysis; and surveys for social network analysis. Findings: The accompanying social research produced direct insights on experiences and knowledge acquisition of participants in a large, complex foresight process, as well as a measurable increase of personal ties in this process. This research shows that the perception of the wider spectrum of actors in a social system, as well as their rationales and approaches, are one identifiable and crucial achievement of participative foresight processes. Research limitations/implications: This research focuses on immediate learning impacts, while additional impacts of mid-or longer-term scales were not captured in this study. Accompanying social research (e.g. longitudinal studies) of broader scale would be beneficial to foresight research and process design. Originality/value: The authors use a specific foresight process to analyze its immediate impacts. They introduce and demonstrate ways forward to use practical concepts for impact description, empirical data acquisition, and how it relates to underlying process design. The results are relevant for foresight project managers, process counselors and accompanying social research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Foresight; Impacts; Learning; Social network analysis; Social networks; Stakeholder participation; Stakeholders",,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics if 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Block, J., Assimilation, accommodation, and the dynamics of personality development (1982) Child Development, 53, pp. 281-295; Bodner, G.M., Constructivism: A theory of knowledge (1986) Journal of Chemical Education, 63, pp. 873-878; Bogenrieder, I., Noteboom, B., (2002) The emergence of learning communities: A conceptual analysis, , University of Rotterdam, Rotterdam; Burt, R.S., Structural holes versus network closure as social capital (2001) Social Capital: Theory and Research, pp. 31-56. , Lin, N., Cook, K.S., Burt, R.S.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper outlines the evolutionary process followed, and documents the practical insights gained and lessons learnt in relation to the concept of pro-poor foresight. Findings: Positive outcomes in the King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) foresight process included a high level of stakeholder engagement and senior management buy-in, supported by positive evaluations by diverse participants. The learning was subsequently incorporated into long-term development plans and proposals such as the ten-year development plan for the region. The experience yielded key lessons about the recruitment of participants, policy alignment, communication in diversity, active participation, facilitation as learning, the influence of technical inputs, and the importance of integration. Research limitations/implications: Further academic research could build upon this case study to investigate longer-term impacts of the initiative in KSD, tracking replications and adaptations of the KSD experiment, comparative research between contexts where foresight is used and where it is not in development policy and planning processes, enquiry into how foresight might be formally incorporated in the routine development policy and planning processes of municipalities, and undertaking more theoretical enquiry on the ""localising foresight"" concept and experience, including the development of guiding criteria and indicators for procedural and outcome success. Practical implications: The case focuses on learning in a developing world context where foresight is less advanced than in other contexts. The results of the exercise in KSD suggest that it is possible to embed pro-poor foresight in a large-scale policy programme to enhance the resilience of communities, supported by appropriate plans and budgets. Social implications: The long-term nature of foresight can create a ""safe"" platform for an otherwise difficult engagement, as is this case where three levels of government and various segments of civil society are to be beneficially engaged.

On the basis of the extensive experience of the authors, this article seeks to offer suggestions regarding the factors that may help policy makers, academics, consultants, and others involved in FTA projects, to produce useful and meaningful contributions to decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology deployed for this article is empirical. It is based on the lessons extracted and evidence produced by the authors' hundreds of diverse global consulting engagements as well as their analytical work on the subject. Added together the authors of this paper have engaged in over 80 years of professional practice. The article summarizes the results of presentations given by the authors and the ensuing discussion that occurred at the conference: Futures Oriented Technology Analysis 2011, held at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) in Seville on 13 May. Findings: Impactful FTA starts with the selection of the appropriate methodologies and skills for the specific anticipatory task. Arguing on the basis of experience, the authors point out that the effective impact of FTA projects on decision-making depends on a strong grasp of the principles of foresight and project design, an educated client with clear expectations and a strong commitment, well-developed communication efforts throughout, and considerable managerial capacity both on the demand and supply sides of the process. Originality/value: By bringing the evidence of experience to bear, this article adds value to existing academic and practitioner discussions of the effectiveness of FTA for decision-making. The article provides an original vantage point on key questions being posed by both users and suppliers of forward-looking activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Anticipation; Critical success factors; Decision making; Foresight; Foresight impact; Forward-looking analysis",,,,,,"Calof, J., Smith, J., The integrative domain of foresight and competitive intelligence and its impact on R&D management (2009) R&D Management, 40 (1), pp. 31-39; Calof, J., Smith, J., Critical success factors for government-led foresight (2010) Science and Public Policy, 37 (1), pp. 31-40. , February; Calof, J., Smith, J., Creating impactful foresight: What does it mean?

These scenarios are followed by Universiti Sains Malaysia's preferred vision of the future. It then examines the journey towards the preferred visión by articulating four stages of transformation: visioning, contesting, dynamic equilibrium, and self-direction/externalisation.

The designer must anticipate not only the behavior of individual actors, but also how that behavior will aggregate. Rising complexity brought about by increases in speeds of adaptation, diversity, connectedness, and interdependence make institutional design all the more challenging. Given the focus on equilibria, the extant literature on mechanism design might appear incapable of coping with this complexity.

In the age of the 24 hour news agenda, the media make us so aware of them that they have a growing impact on public opinion. And so vulnerable have today's cities become, with the complexity and interconnectedness of their various networks (electricity, gas, water, telecommunications), that this is truer still when they occur in urban environments. However, as Jacques de Courson argues here, these urban disasters, whether associated with natural catastrophes (earthquakes, storms, flooding etc.), industrial accidents (pollution, explosions), political events (terrorism and uprisings) or other factors, may also have salutary effects for populations. Hence the importance of studying these phenomena more closely from a foresight angle. This is why, after examining what is to be understood by the notion of urban disaster (definition, typology, reasons to fear such disasters or otherwise), de Courson presents various strategic options for the public officials of potentially vulnerable towns and cities. Drawing on historical instances (Carthage, Babylon) or more contemporary examples (Kabul, Bangkok), he shows what lessons are to be learned to ""turn disasters to advantage"" - despite the tragedies they produce - and he offers six possible development scenarios for towns or cities faced with this type of challenge. Human beings have always bounced back from the severest catastrophes and this foresight exercise on urban disasters well reflects this, while throwing into question the pertinence of the ""town/city"" level in this context. What is to be done, however, if the disaster in question assumes planetary proportions (global warming, for example)? It remains an open question.",,,,,,,"Damon Julien, V., Une ville créée ex nihilo en Inde Futuribles, (378), pp. 69-70. , octobre 2011; Georges, D., (1980) Histoirc de la France Urbaine, , La ville antique des origines au IX siécle Paris : Seuil, tome 1","De Courson, J.",,,,,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

Genomic selection (GS) is a statistical approach that utilizes all available genome-wide markers simultaneously to estimate breeding values or total genetic values. For breeding programmes, GS is a promising alternative to the traditional marker-assisted selection for manipulating complex polygenic traits often controlled by many small-effect genes. Various factors, such as genetic architecture of selection traits, population size and structure, genetic evaluation systems, density of SNP markers and extent of linkage disequilibrium, have been shown to be the key drivers of the accuracy of GS. In this paper, we provide an overview of the status of these aspects in current apple-breeding programmes. Strategies for GS for fruit quality and disease resistance are discussed, and an update on an empirical genomic selection study in a New Zealand apple-breeding programme is provided, along with a foresight of expected accuracy from such selection. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Apple-breeding programme; DNA sequence; Genomic selection; Malus × domestica Borkh.; Quantitative trait loci","Malus; Malus x domestica",,,,,"Andersson, L., Genetic dissection of phenotypic diversity in farm animals (2001) Nat Rev Genet, 2, pp. 130-138; Beavis, W.D., The power and deceit of QTL experiments: Lessons from comparative QTL studies.

Secondly, the move to transcend disciplinary specialisation, via inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary approaches is strengthening. Thirdly, at a higher order theoretical level, these developments are explicitly theorized in the discourses associated with postformal reasoning, integral theory and planetary consciousness. In spite of all these developments in other disciplines and knowledge fields, the institution of mass public education, with its underpinning industrial worldview, has been pretty static since its inception two hundred years ago. Finally, the paper identifies three minor, but significant, waves of evolutionary emergence in education over the last hundred years that if articulated and nurtured could strengthen the development of evolutionary pedagogies for the 21st century. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolution of consciousness; Evolutionary pedagogies; Foresight; Futures studies; Integral; Planetary; Postformal; Postformal pedagogies","education; theoretical study",,,,,"Gidley, J., Inayatullah, S., (2002) Youth Futures: Comparative Research and Transformative Visions, , Praeger, Westport, CT; Gidley, J., Bateman, D., Smith, C., (2004) Futures in Education: Principles, Practice and Potential, , Australian Foresight Institute, Melbourne; Freire, P., (1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, , Herder and Herder, New York; Illich, I., (1975) Deschooling Society, , Calder and Boyers, London; Gidley, J., Beyond homogenisation of global education: do alternative pedagogies such as Steiner education have anything to offer an emergent globalis/ing world?

These issues will remain for a long time as key considerations in the safe, regular, efficient and economic development of air transport. Within these four broad categories come numerous subjects that require attention of the aviation industry as well as the States. In six chapters, this book engages in detailed discussions on these subjects as they unravelled in events of recent years. The issue of safety is addressed first, following an introduction of the regulatory regime covering the four issues. Within the area of safety, the book covers such areas as safety management systems, safety and aeromedicine, safety and meteorology, the use of airspace, unmanned aircraft systems and safety oversight audits. In the security area, subjects covered include cyber terrorism, the integrity of travel documents, full body scanners, civil unrest and aviation, the suppression of unlawful acts on board aircraft and the financing of terrorism. The chapter on the environment focuses mainly on climate change - particularly on carbon credits, market based measures, the carbon market and emissions trading schemes and their effect on air transport. Finally, the chapter on sustainability discusses in detail market access along with such issues as slot allocation, open skies, the use of alternative fuels as an economic measure and corporate foresight. The concluding chapter wraps up with a discussion on where air transport is headed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Following the same tradition the prophet (pbuh) followed it at home and abroad with people of different faiths and taught the same principles to his companions. The prophet (PBUH) highly appreciated the Dawah principles when they were followed by his companions. The first such Dawah mission was sent to the Kingdom of Abyssinia. This paper focuses on the foresight of the Prophet (pbuh) about place and audience analysis. It will also do content analyses of the letter to King of Abyssinia by the Prophet (pbuh) and the speech of Ja'farin in the palace of King Negus.. This paper discusses how Muslims were received in the Kingdom of Abyssinia and message of Islam was conceived by Christians and how Muslims removed the misconceptions about Islam from the minds of audience and why the Muslims represented by Ja'far (RA) were given complete protection and asylum. The paper also analyses the role of effective and persuasive communication and personality in successful dialoguing. Allah addressed mankind in the Holy Quran and commanded his Prophet (PBUH) for dialogue. Dialoguing with complete humility is the tradition of all Prophets including Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The Holy Prophet (PBUH) had dialogue with people of different faiths at all levels, kings, nobles, tribal heads, the rich and the poor He taught ethics and principles for holding dialogue. He gave permission to his companions to hold dialogue for Dawah and remove misconceptions about Islam from the minds of people of the world. He (pbuh) preached that Ill-will among people can be removed through dialogue. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",,,,,,,"Tantawi, S.M., (1997) Adab Al Hiwar Fil Islam, p. 436. , (Arabic) (Ethics of Communication in Islam).

Patients examined were between 6 months and 6 years post-HCT and aged from 19 to 65 years. Subjects were investigated for both the subjective and objective features of long-term adverse oral effects of HCT. The most common oral symptoms reported were xerostomia (44%, n=39) and reduction in taste (20%, n=18). Only a minority of patients (15%) reported that oral disease had a significant adverse impact upon their quality of life. The majority of patients (53%) had clinical markers of oral chronic GVHD (cGVHD). The most frequently identified feature was salivary hypofunction, with 34% of subjects demonstrating a reduction in stimulated saliva. Oral mucosal changes consistent with cGVHD affected 21% of subjects. Oral cGVHD commonly occurs after allogeneic HCT, often coexists with cutaneous, hepatic or ocular cGVHD and may lead to debilitating symptoms. Transplant type and pre-existing acute GVHD are the major risk factors for oral cGVHD. The identification of risk factors specific for oral cGVHD may allow clinicians some foresight into identifying patients at high risk of developing oral cGVHD and encourage attention to education, regular oral surveillance and rigorous preventative oral health strategies both pre-and post-transplant. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This assumption is based on the similarities of the ape-like brain size and post-cranial characteristics of the earliest hominid species to chimpanzees. Whilst it is unclear whether chimpanzees share the same foresight and contemplation of alternatives as with humans, it is nevertheless clear that chimpanzees lack creative imagination - an aspect of modern human imagination that sets humanity apart from its hominid ancestors. Creative imagination pertains to the ability to combine different forms of knowledge and ways of thinking to form creative and novel ideas. This chapter discusses seven critical steps in the evolution of the human imagination. These steps provide a clear picture of the gradual emergence of creative imagination in humans from their primitive origins as Homo sapiens some 200,000 years ago. This chronological evolution of the imaginative mind of humans involves both biological and cultural change that began soon after the divergence of the two lineages that led to modern humans and African apes. © The British Academy 2007.

The development of engineering materials constitutes one of the most significant elements in the field of science and technology, and innovative policy in Poland and Europe as regards the knowledge-based economy (KBE). The enhancement of the product functional properties, required by the new strategies of engineering materials development, as well as materials processing technologies is frequently connected with appropriate formation of the engineering materials surface layer structure and properties. Functional properties of many products depend not only on the possibility of transferring the mechanical load across the whole element section or its physicochemical properties, but, most often, they depend mainly on the surface layer structure and properties. The application of foresight methodology in the assessment of the state and prospects regarding the development of technology related to the formation of the materials surface structure and properties provides the possibility to manage knowledge in this field. It can be achieved through a formalization of the explicit and tacit knowledge gathering and use in order to increase production competitiveness, effectiveness, and innovation, improve the quality of life and achieve sustainable development. The objectives accomplished in such a way contribute to the increase in intellectual capital by enhancing the effectiveness of using the existing knowledge, creating new knowledge, as well as increasing the level of understanding and disseminating knowledge. The implemented foresight project will result in identifying the priority innovative technologies and strategic research trends in the scope of surface structure and properties formation of engineering materials and biomaterials whose development in the country will be of key importance within next 20 years. © 2012 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Analysis and modelling; Foresight; Methodology of research; Technology roadmapping; Technology value and development","Analysis and modelling; Engineering materials; Explicit and tacit knowledge; Foresight; Functional properties; Innovative technology; Intellectual capital; Knowledge based economy; Material surface; Materials processing technology; Mechanical loads; New strategy; Physicochemical property; Quality of life; Science and Technology; Strategic research; Structure and properties; Surface layers; Technological progress; Technology roadmapping; Biological materials; Biomaterials; Competition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Manufacture; Mechanical properties; Planning; Solids; Strategic materials; Structural properties; Surface structure; Technology; Innovation",,,,,"Organization for economic co-operation and development OECD (1999) The Knowledge-Based Economy, , Paris; Dobrzańska-Danikiewicz, A., E-foresight of materials surface engineering (2010) Archives of Materials Science and Engineering, 44 (1), pp. 43-50; Georghiou, L., Harper, J.C., Keenan, M., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight, , Concepts and Practice, Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd., UK; Kisielnicki, J., (2008) MIS.

In addition, the aim is to construct information pathways for the foresight mechanism, for the use of practitioners, to enable them to manage talent and competences with an anticipatory perspective. The research strategy is theoretical research with interpretive concept analysis approach. The research compares, compiles and combines theories and perspectives of strategic human resource management and development, talent management, competence management and foresight. The results combine the information pathways and elements of the pathways for the competence foresight mechanism. The main three pathways in the mechanism are the pathways for detecting the needed competences for strategy implementation, the pathways for detecting rapid changes and the loss of competences. As talent management frameworks are organization specific, so are the mechanisms and information pathways for competence foresight. The results can be adjusted and developed to fit into other organizations. The analysis and results provide the practitioners in human resources with new perspectives to use systematic foresight processes in talent management and development. The results can also be used for modelling the information pathways for the competence foresight mechanism in talent management software. The research on human resources development and talent management does not deal with competence foresight. This paper addresses this deficiency and brings new, valuable perspectives of foresight and future studies for researchers and practitioners. This paper challenges further research on various aspects of competence foresight. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Competence foresight; Competences; Human resource management; Information pathways in foresight mechanism; Strategic human resource management; Talent management and development",,,,,,"Aalto, H.-K., (2007) Ennakoinnista eväitä koulutussuunnitteluun ja työelämäyhteistyöhön, , Tulevaisuuden tutkimuskeskus, Turku; Baldwin, R., (2006) Globalisation: The Great Unbundling(s), , Prime Minister's Office in Finland, Helsinki; Boam, R., Sparrow, P.R., The rise and rationale of competency-based approaches (1992) Designing and Achieving Competency: A Competency-based Approach to Developing People and Organisations, pp. 3-15. , in Boam, R. and Sparrow, P.R.

Thus, it is still a problem for decision-makers to choose among the equilibria. On the basis of the traditional metagame algorithm, this paper develops a new algorithm by taking ""foresight incentive"" into consideration, so as to obtain more terse and stable equilibria. The analysis steps of the foresight incentive algorithm include generating a route for each player in each scenario, identifying the check-point in each route, examining if each check-point is foresight incentive point, and analyzing the stability of each scenario for each player. Finally, through the case study of a real construction conflict, the effectiveness and superiority of the foresight incentive algorithm are verified.","Conflict; Construction; Foresight incentive algorithm; Foresight incentive point; Route","Construction; Decision making; Conflict; Conflict analysis; Foresight incentive point; Incentive algorithm; ITS applications; Multiple equilibrium; Route; Stable equilibrium; Pareto principle",,,,,"Howard, N., (1971) Paradox of Rationality: Theory of Metagame and Political Behavior, , The MIT Press, London, UK; Fraser, N.M., Hipel, K.W., (1984) Conflict Analysis: Models and Resolutions, , North-Holland, New York, U.S. A; Kilgour, D.M., Hipel, K.W., Fang, L., (1987) The graph model for conflicts, Automatica, 23 (1), pp. 41-55; Fang, L., Hipel, K.W., Kilgour, D.M., (1993) Interactive decision making: The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, , New York: Wiley; Howard, N., The Management as Politician and General: The Metagame Approach to Analysing Cooperation and Conflict (1989) Rational analysis for a problematic world, pp. 239-261. , In: Rosenhead, J.

Foresight has made a transition from thematic papers and policy briefs to a complex set of methods integrated in the framework of S&T and innovation policy making. Foresight also addresses broad social and economic issues along with conventional S&T problems. It focuses often on interdisciplinary fields and cross-sector problems. It has witnessed the introduction of such new methods as weak signals and wild cards, and it has benefitted from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Russian S&T foresight follows global trends. It has given support for revisions of the national S&T priorities and critical technologies. In 2007-2010, two cycles of the National S&T Foresight (initiated by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation) were completed. They resulted in the creation of frameworks and expert networks for future studies. Foresight culture has been finding deeper roots in Russia. The paper addresses mainly the key features of the third (ongoing) cycle of the national S&T Foresight (2011) against the background of the first two cycles and the international trends. This cycle represents a wider coverage of issues (macroeconomic scenarios, trends in basic research, S&T resources, future dem and for skills, and global drivers of S&T developments); more complicated methodologies (bibliometric analysis, expert panels, surveys, roadmapping, and quantitative models); and a combination of ""market pull"" and ""technology push"" approaches toward estimating future developments. This cycle is building a wider network of experts at new Foresight centres at various Russian research universities. It concludes with a discussion of some barriers still to be overcome in Foresight studies: integration of sectoral visions, deeper analyses of some scientific disciplines, stronger integration into policy making, and spreading among business and research communities.","Critical technologies; Decision-making; Foresight; Long-term forecasting; National innovation system; Roadmapping; Russian long-term S&T foresight; S&T priorities",,,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Grand challenges - A new framework for foresight evaluation (2011) Paper Presented at the EU-SPRI Conference, , 20-22 September.

Into this broad model we have combined, in a novel way, much-used and well-known concepts and ideas, such as exploration and exploitation, absorptive capacity, three modes of foresight activities, information quality attributes, and information brokerage. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,,,,,,"Becerra-Fernandez, I., Gonzalez, A., Sabherwal, R., (2004) Knowledge Management: Challenges, Solutions and Technologies, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bootz, J.P., Strategic foresight and organizational learning: A survey and critical analysis (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1588-1594; Boschma, R.A., Proximity and innovation.

Methodology/approach – A review of contemporary modelling approaches that consider the future for transport applications, with a focus on complexity and uncertainty issues, the search for foresight, the role of engagement and the credibility of qualitative foresight. Findings – The importance of the need to incorporate socio-economic scenarios in climate change models and the possibilities offered by the tool of systematic qualitative foresight are demonstrated. Originality/value – Explores limitations of quantitative modelling approaches to foresight and introduces a potentially complementary, innovative approach based on the systematic use of qualitative methodologies. © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Foresight; Future; Modelling; Scenarios; Transport",,,,,,"Adam, B., (2007) Future Matters: Action, Knowledge, Ethics, , Netherlands: Brill; Adams, J., London’s third airport (1971) Geographical Journal, 137, pp. 468-504; Adams, J., (1981) Transport Planning, , London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd; (1993) Realising Our Potential: A Strategy for Science, Engineering and Technology, , Anonymous, White Paper, Select Committee on Science and Technology; Banister, D., Hickman, R., (2005) Looking over the Horizon: Visioning and Backcasting for UK Transport Policy, , http://www.vibat.org/vibat_uk/pdf/vibatuk_method_issues.pdf; Bechky, B.A., Sharing meaning across occupational communities: The transformation of understanding on a production floor (2003) Organization Science, 14 (3), pp. 312-330; Bernstein, P.L., (1996) Against The Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk, , New York, NY: Wiley; Bohman, J., (1996) Public Deliberation: Pluralism, Complexity, and Democracy, , MIT Press; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., (2000) Sorting Things Out, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Brown, N., Rappert, B., Webster, A., (2000) Contested Futures: A Sociology of Prospective Techno-Science, , Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Publishing Limited; Carlsson, F., Johansson-Stenman, O., Martinsson, P., Is transport safety more valuable in the air?

Instead, they need to consider all the possible factors that will influence new technological developments and formulate an appropriate future technological development strategy to the country through the technology foresight system. For the sake of gathering more objective evidence to convince stakeholders to support the foresight issues, researchers can employ bibliometric analysis to describe current scientific development and forecast possible future development trends. Through this process, a consensus is reached about the direction of future technology development. However, we believe that bibliometric analysis can do more for technology policy formulation, such as (1) offer quantitative data as evidence to support the results of qualitative analysis; (2) review the situations of literature publication in specific technological fields to seize the current stage of technology development; and (3) help us grasp the relative advantage of foresight issues development in Taiwan and the world and develop profound strategic planning in accordance with the concept of Revealed Comparative Advantage. For those reasons, our research will revisit the role that bibliometric analysis plays for nations while choosing the foresight issues. In addition, we will analyze the development of the technology policy in Taiwan based on bibliometric analysis, and complete the foresight issues selection by processing key issue integration, key word collection related to this field, the searching and confirmation of literature, development opportunities exploration, comparative development advantage analysis and the innovation-foresight matrix construction, etc. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Agricultural technology; Bibliometric analysis; Research strategies; Revealed comparative advantage (RCA); S-curve; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Albuquerque, E., Scientific infrastructure and catching-up process: Notes about a relationship illustrated by science and technology statistics (2001) Revista Brasileira De Economia, 55, pp. 545-566; Albuquerque, E., (2003) Immature Systems of Innovation: Introductory Notes About a Comparison Between South Africa, India, Mexico and Brazil Based On Science and Technology Statistics, , Discussion paper No. 221.

Adequate tools to identify, assess and manage future developments are key to survive in a turbulent environment. In our paper, we present the systematic development process of an innovative, web-based foresight platform, which is a joint research project funded by the German Federal Government and aims to improve the robustness in decision making by collaborative foresight. Its four interlinked applications have the purpose to enable their users a collaborative generation, discussion, evaluation and development of future-oriented knowledge. Thereby, a special emphasis is on the relevance and the timeliness of the provided information. Within the multi-stage requirement analysis of the tool platform we analyzed existing concepts in order to identify strengths and weaknesses and conducted brainstorming sessions and interviews with professionals of 130 companies and organizations to account for different backgrounds, perspectives and intentions. © 2012 ISCRAM.","Collaboration; Foresight; Foresight support system; Prediction market; Trend database","Information systems; Brainstorming sessions; Collaboration; Foresight; German federal government; Prediction markets; Requirement analysis; Support systems; Turbulent environments; Commerce",,,,,"Auer, S., Lehmann, J., Creating knowledge out of interlinked data (2010) Semantic Web Journal, 1, pp. 97-104; Amsteus, M., Managers' foresight matters (2011) Foresight - The Journal of Future Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 13 (2), pp. 64-78; Banuls, V.A., Salmeron, J.L., Scope and design issues in foresight support systems (2011) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 7 (4), pp. 338-351; De Laat, B., Conditions for effectiveness of roadmapping: A cross-sectional analysis of 80 different roadmapping exercises (2004) Proceedings of the EU-US Scientific Seminar: New Technology Foresight, Forecasting & Assessment Methods, pp. 13-14. , European Commission DG JRC-IPTS, Seville; Hayek, F.A., The use of knowledge in society (1945) The American Economic Review, 35, pp. 519-530; Ho, T.-H., Chen, K.-Y., New product blockbusters: The magic and science of prediction markets (2007) California Management Review, 50, pp. 144-158; Höjer, M., Gullberg, A., Pettersson, R., Backcasting images of the future city - time and space for sustainable development in stockholm (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78, pp. 819-834; Hoyer, W.D., Chandy, R., Dorotic, M., Krafft, M., Singh, S.S., Consumer cocreation in new product development (2010) Journal of Service Research, 13, pp. 283-296; Jungk, R., Muellert, N., (1988) Future Workshops: How to Create Desirable Futures, , Institute for Social Inventions, London; Kane, G.C., Fichman, R.G., The shoemaker's children: Using wikis for information systems teaching, research, and publication (2009) MIS Quarterly, 33, pp. 1-17; Koivisto, R., Wessberg, N., Eerola, A., Ahlqvist, T., Kivisaari, S., Myllyoja, J., Halonen, M., Integrating future-oriented technology analysis and risk assessment methodologies (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76, pp. 1163-1176; Leimeister, J.M., Huber, M.J., Bretschneider, U., Krcmar, H., Leveraging crowdsourcing: Activation-supporting components for IT-based ideas competition (2009) Journal of Management Information Systems, 26, pp. 187-224; Martin, B.R., Foresight in science and technology (1995) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 7 (2), pp. 139-168; Nijs, D.E.L., (2009) Imagineering: Towards A Design Approach to Transform the Enterprise Logic, , White paper in the context of the PhD-study under supervision of Prof. dr. ir.

In addition, the article details the next iteration of the program called Future Agenda, which is the world's largest foresight program, and the only one developed on an open source framework. Linking foresight to innovation in order to explore opportunities is an effective method of developing new high margin offerings. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

The influence of internal and external factors on the market of postal money orders of the Republic is constructed and investigated using the statistical regression model of the market of postal money orders of the Komi Republic in the period of 2005-2010. The conceptual foresight of development of the regional market of postal money orders for 2011-2012 is presented. Regression models were analyzed not only for the dynamic sequence of data, but also for sequences of data on territories, which revealed independent correlated factors which are weakly changing and evolving over time. The presented results have important practical and methodological significance for predicting both the volume of postal money orders as well as other types of services.","Conceptual foresight; Forecasting; Internal and external factors; Market of postal money orders; Regression analysis",,,,,,"O Pochtovoy Svyazi.

Innovation is considered as a key driver to foster economic growth and overcome crises. Innovation processes are among the most troubled fields of governance. Today policy-makers and experts face two basic challenges - dealing with increasing complexity of the global context and broadening the range of issues in order to improve the implementation of innovation strategies. This fundamental issue was the focus of discussions held on mid-October 2012 under the HSE ISSEK and OECD joint conference, which coincided with ISSEK's 10-year anniversary. The agenda included three sessions: STI Policy Futures; Responses to Grand Challenges; Strategic Intelligence Tools. Presentations were made by experts from OECD, University of Manchester (UK), University of Ottawa (Canada), Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (Germany); Georgia Technology University (USA), Science and Technology Policy Institute (Republic of Korea), Higher School of Economics etc. The following issues were discussed: future of STI policy; STI policy agenda for Russia; applying Foresight to setting priorities for STI policy; S&T responses to Global Challenges; and new tools of Foresight. The participants concluded that there is a necessity to revise policy instruments established in the last century as well as consolidate resources and ideas in order to meet accelerating global changes. It is unlikely that global challenges have ultimate solutions. However tackling them necessitates purposeful, joint and continuous efforts by stakeholders. Foresight as a tool enabling creation of interdisciplinary knowledge and reconciling stakeholders' interests together can play a crucial role in this process.",,,,,,,,,,,"National Research University",,,,,1995459X,,,,"Russian","Foresight Russ.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896910508

The events organized by the HSE Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge were attended by leading international experts in the field of Foresight and science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. International workshops on technology platforms (TPs) have been held at the HSE on a regular basis since 2010. They address Russian and international practices in the shaping and functioning of TPs and the possibility of adapting international best practices in Russia, thus serving as a learning forum. In 2011 the discussion focused on practicalities of cooperation between Russian and European platforms, including an assessment of the prospects for increasing coordination and building communications. Special attention was paid to some general issues concerning the creation and operation of TPs, like the involvement of companies in pre-competitive research, the distribution of intellectual property rights between parties, the strengthening of university-industry relations as a key element of TPs, the involvement of government in the establishment and operation of platforms, and the role of small and mediumsized enterprises. The workshop participants also discussed opportunities and threats of international cooperation in STI as well as the contribution of TPs to further development of cooperation. The objectives, framework, and interim results of selected Russian and European platforms were presented. The second workshop reported the results of the Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight 2030. Compared to previous rounds, the coverage of economic sectors and pool of experts was significantly increased through expansion of industry-related research. The current round presumes the implementation of 17 projects to be integrated at the next stage. Its findings will form the basis of strategic recommendations for innovative development of selected sectors, and it will be embedded into elaboration of STI policy. The third workshop was devoted to the development of methodologiesand international practices of Foresight studies.

Today's value creation is spread over different actors of value nets and need to be considered appropriately. One of the firm's challenges is to identify change drivers and to systematically estimate their impact on the business model.

One of the most widespread approaches is the development of scenarios, which are alternative hypothetical futures. Research has indicated, however, that the reality of how professionals go about employing scenarios is often starkly at odds with the theory - a finding that has important ramifications for how the resulting images of the future should be interpreted. It also shows the need for rewriting and updating theory. This book, based on an intensive five year study of how experts actually go about assessing the future, provides a groundbreaking examination of foresighting in action. Obtained via ethnographic techniques, the results lay bare for the first time the real processes by which scenarios are made. It is also the first book to examine foresighting for public policy, which is so often overlooked in favour of business practice. From handling of discontinuity to historical determinism, the analysis reveals and explains why foresight is difficult and what the major pitfalls are. Each chapter ends with a toolkit of recommendations for practice. The book aims to help readers to reflect on their own practices of public-oriented foresight and thus to foster a deeper understanding of the key principles and challenges. Ultimately, this will lead to better informed decision making. © Marjolein B.

Successfully dealing with the growing impacts of change on social-ecological systems depends on our ability to anticipate change. But traditional scientific tools are blunt instruments for studying a future that does not exist. We propose that futures research, a transdisciplinary field of inquiry that has been developing for more than 50 years, offers an underused but fruitful set of approaches to address this important challenge. A few futures research methods-notably several forms of scenario analysis-have been applied to environmental issues and problems in recent years. But futurists have developed an array of other useful methods for exploring possible, plausible, and preferable futures, important insights into the nature of change, and perspectives for thinking creatively and deeply about the future. We present an overview of futures research and its potential to enrich environmental planning and policy by offering a cross-fertilization of new ideas and approaches, providing a more complete view of emerging environmental problems, and facilitating the development of strategies to increase adaptive capacity and deal more effectively with surprises. © 2012 by the author(s).","Environmental futures; Futures research; Scenarios; Strategic foresight","adaptive management; environmental impact; environmental planning; future prospect; prediction; research method; social impact",,,,,"Alcamo, J., (2008) Environmental futures: The practice of environmental scenario analysis, , editor., Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of futures studies, volume 1: History, purposes, and knowledge, , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA; Bennett, E.M., Carpenter, S.R., Peterson, G.D., Cumming, G.S., Zurek, M., Pingali, P., Why global scenarios need ecology (2003) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 1 (6), pp. 322-329. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1540-9295(2003)001[0322:WGSNE]2.0.CO;2; Bennett, E.M., Peterson, G.D., Levitt, E.A., Looking to the future of ecosystem services (2005) Ecosystems, 8, pp. 125-132. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-004-0078-y; Bezold, C., Using vision in futures planning (2009) Futures research methodology-version 3.0, , In J.

It is a ubiquitious phenomenon whereby the outcome seems obvious. Students were randomly assigned either to a foresight group, in which they solved the multiple steps of a paired comparison t-test, or a hindsight group, in which they did not solve the steps of the paired comparison t-test but the correct answers were present. They were then asked to make chance and difficulty estimations for each step. Students in the hindsight condition believed they had a greater chance of a correct solution and that it was easier than foresight students.

The active orientation requires that the metropolis involve the resources from the market and direct them towards the goals. This requires a paradigm shift in plans and policies, from legislation and financial incentives, towards the involvement of private sector and citizens, seeking equilibrium among social, private and personal utilities. GranTorino adopted a dialogue model, that is, “a complex model of interacting processes where the directives coming from the top are informed by the perceptions of problems, possible solutions, and situational constraints coming from below, and where these directives in turn structure perceptions and the search for solutions at the section level” (Mayntz 1976). GranTorino has been structured along five tiers: (1) Define the domain of public participation, (2) empower stakeholders’ knowledge, (3) generate personal foresight, (4) evaluate foresight and (5) map the knowledge. GranTorino, by listening to citizens’ preferences and expectations, has provided to a broad public the opportunity to contribute to the shaping of the metropolitan city, in order to assess what the personal foresights are, and has provided feedback through evaluation and measurement. GranTorino provides evidence that when people are actively involved, they can help to generate a heightened sense of public value. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","Active participation; E-governance; Participatory platform; Policy-making",,,,,,"Bagnasco, A., (1986) Torino.

It focuses on gathering and managing the rules that govern the evolution of selected information society technologies (IST) and their applications. The main idea of information gathering and processing here presented refers to so-called real-time expert Delphi, where an expert community works on the same research problems by responding to structured questionnaires, elaborating complex dynamical system models, providing recommendations, and verifying the models so arisen. The knowledge base is structured in layers that correspond to the selected kinds of information on the technology and social evolution, uses, markets, and management. An analytical engine uses labelled hypermultigraphs to process the mutual impacts of objects from each layer to elicit the technological evolution rules and calculate future trends and scenarios. The processing rules are represented within discrete-time and discrete-event control models. Multicriteria decision support procedures make it possible to aggregate individual expert recommendations. The resulting foresight support system can process uncertain information using a fuzzy-random-variable-based model, while a coupled reputation management system can verify collective expert judgments and assign trust vectors to experts and other sources of information. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.","Complex Socioeconomic Models; Foresight Support Systems; Group Model Building; Intelligent Decision Support; Knowledge Fusion","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Discrete event simulation; Dynamical systems; Information science; Knowledge based systems; Surveys; Group model building; Intelligent decision support; Knowledge fusion; Socio-economic model; Support systems; Information management",,,,,"Antoniou, M.R., Stenning, V., The Information Society as a Complex System (2000) Journal of Universal Computer Science, 6 (3), pp. 272-288; Bañuls, V.A., Salmeron, J.L., Scope and Design Issues in Foresight Support Systems (2011) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 7 (4), pp. 338-351; Górecki, H., Skulimowski, A.M.J., A Joint Consideration of Multiple Reference Points in Multicriteria Decision Making (1986) Found.

To assess the probabilities the experts' opinions on the expected time of implementation on the industrial scale of the considered technologies were used. The experts' opinions were obtained by Delphi analysis within the energy foresight carried out by Central Mining Institute in Katowice (Poland). Due to the fact that the results reached are equivocal (they are burdened with a high level of a subjective view of experts) and imprecise, instead of using classical methods of classification, the fussy sets theory is used. The following sets were defined: high, moderate and low probabilities of technology implementation. The results of the carried analysis show that the highest probabilities of implementation (from the point of view of the expected time of implementation) are of those technologies which base on fossil fuels (coal preparation, oil and gas industry) and management of burning by-products.","Foresight; Fuzzy sets; Modern energy technologies","Coal industry; Fuzzy sets; Gas industry; Information management; Sustainable development; Classical methods; Energy technologies; Foresight; Future technologies; Industrial scale; Low probability; Oil and Gas Industry; Technology implementation; Probability",,,,,"Castellano, G., Fanelli, A.M., Mencar, C., Design of Transparent Mamdani Fuzzy Inference Systems (2003) Design and application of hybrid intelligent systems, pp. 468-476. , IOS Press Amsterdam; Driankov, D., Hellendorn, H., Reinfrank, M., An Introduction to Fuzzy Control (1996), Springer -Verlag, Berlin; Fishburn, P.C., The Axioms of Subjective Probability (1986) Statistical Science, 3 (1), pp. 335-358; Halal, W.E., Kull, M.D., Leffmann, A., Emerging Technologies.

We have used the Technological Foresight approach to structure the survey and prospective methods and techniques of multivariate statistical analysis of results. Information has been raised at a panel organized with the participation of 50 experts from the region, and the results showed that levels of technical expertise, supply of technologies and technical assistance are variables which are important to generate employment and future income. In addition, actions of technology transfer are essential in the short run and the R&D with technical training for farmers and workers, in the long run. Production activities related to agribusiness were highlighted for job creation to rural workers. New activities, such as rubber tree, eucalyptus, goats, sheep, crop-livestock integration and ornamental plants were considered important to generate income.","Family farms; Prospecting demands; Rural farmer; Technological foresight; Technology transfer",,,,,,"Aleixo, S.S., Souza, J.G., Ferraudo, A.S., Técnicas de análise multivariada na determinação de grupos homogêneos de produtores de leite (2007) Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia, 36 (6), pp. 2168-2175; Benzecri, J.P., (1973) Analyse de données: analyse de correspondances, , Paris: Dunod; Bliska, F.M.M., Guerreiro Filho, O., Fazuoli, L.C., Silvarolla, M.B., Gonçalves, W., Priorização de estratégias de pesquisa e desenvolvimento para a cadeia de produção do café no Estado de São Paulo.

These scenarios have been designed through a foresight exercise conducted by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) as part of the CROSSROAD Project, a support action of the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme. After presenting the conceptual framework and methodological approach followed, the scenario design framework developed and the resulting views of what the European Information Society might be by 2030 are presented. The article follows with a discussion of the implications of the scenarios design in terms of key areas of expected change and grand challenges to be addressed. It concludes by identifying policy challenges and proposing possible future research directions in the domain of ICT for governance and policy modelling needed to build a truly open Digital Europe twenty years from now. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Governance; Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs); Modelling; Policy making; Research; Scenarios",,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Grossklags, J., What can behavioral economics teach us about privacy?

In order to expand the development of the automotive sector and to create new local and worldwide opportunities, the Federation of Industries of Paraná (FIEP) developed and employed an innovative scenario building methodology to analyze the automotive industry's potential for innovation and attendance of new market demands for 2020; which is Sector Foresight. Therefore, results allow the players to have a clearer managerial view of the industry's possible future. This chapter seeks to publicize the experience as well as the results of this innovative project by focusing on the methodology and tools. Data sources included a review of the literature, document analysis, direct observation, semi-structured interviews and two rounds of questionnaires. This experience contributed to innovate the organizational and methodological processes of FIEP, and to improve the perspective of innovation in the automotive sector through a new approach to scenario building. Results also shown this methodology can be applied to other industries in future studies. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"(2007) European Automotive Industry Report 07/08, , ACEA, Bruxelas: European Automobile Manufacturers Association; Anuário Estatístico Da Indústria Automobilística Brasileira, , ANFAVEA, ANFAVEA, 2007.(in portuguese); (2006) World Development Indicators, , http://dev-data.worldbank.org/wdi2006/contents/cover.htm, Banco Mundial, Retrieved Oct 07, 2008, from; (2007) World Development Indicators, , Banco Mundial, Washington, Banco Mundial; Bardin, L., (1977) Análise De Conteúdo, , Lisboa: Edições 70.(in portuguese); (1999) Pólos Automotivos Brasileiros, pp. 173-200. , BNDES, BNDES Setorial, Rio de Janeiro, n. 10, set.

The project was designed to provide information, what is the level of social acceptance of zeroemission technology. The main objective of the authors was to identify the factors that Polish society perceives to be the most conducive to the development of zero-emission economy, and, on the other hand, recognizes as the strongest barriers in this respect. The presented aspects include the results analysis of a questionnaire-type study, which was conducted on the sample of 1200 respondents. For each of thesis the following questions were answered: 1.When will the thesis be realized? 2. What will be the impact of the thesis assumptions implementation on the individual fields of zeroemission economy? 3.What factors will facilitate and which will impede the implementation of this thesis? The analysis of the responses to question 1 was based on subjective probability theory, assuming that the duration of the thesis implementation is a random variable of Weibull distribution. Answers to question 2 and 3 were presented in the form of individual influence matrices, and then appropriate calculations were performed. This allowed to determine the impact of the factors identified in the study and of the surrounding fields on the zero emission economy. It has been shown that the most potent stimulators are: appropriate public education and the new legal regulations, whereas the barriers are: habits of society firmly rooted in the coal economy and the economic costs of zeroemission policy.","Energetic foresight; Judgement forecasting","Information management; Laws and legislation; Sustainable development; Weibull distribution; CO2 emissions; Economic costs; Energetic foresight; Legal regulation; Public education; Social acceptance; Subjective probability; Zero emission; Economics",,,,,"Coombs, R., Green, K., Richards, A., Walsh, W., Technology And The Market -Demand, Users and Innovation (2001), Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, Cheltenham; Energy technologies: Knowledge, perception, measures (2007) Special Eurobarometer, 262. , European Commission, Wave 65.3 - TNS Opinion & Social; Makridakis, S., Wheelwright, S.C., Forecasting: Methods and Applications (1997), John Wiley, New York; Poradowska, K., Forecasting New events occurrence time on the example of the analysis of foresight research results (2010), Forecasting, Econometrics 28, Research Papers of Wroclaw University of Economics no. 91; (2012), http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2011/STAGING/local_assets/pdf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2012.pdf, Statistical Review of World Energy 2012 [Retrieved August 15; (2003), http://www.oecd.org/environment/climatechange/2956490.pdf, Technology Innovation, Development and Diffusion [Retrived 2003], OECD and IEA Information Paper - COM/ENV/EPOC/IEA/SLT 4",,,"","International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA","19th IBIMA Conference on Innovation Vision 2020: Sustainable Growth, Entrepreneurship and Economic Development","12 November 2012 through 13 November 2012","Barcelona",103298,,,,,"English","Inniv.

Design/methodology/approach: Conceptual frameworks to link the research process with the report structure, and in turn with journal outlets, are presented. Findings: These indicate that the research process and the awareness of the components of the report structure as well as potential journal outlets may at an early stage uncover any pitfalls and flaws in one's scholarly studies in academia. Research limitations/implications: A transparent understanding and foresight of what is ahead in, and interconnected between, the elements of the research process, the components of the report structure and the potential journal outlets are crucial to enhance the ultimate scholarly performance. The discussion is in part limited to the commonly applied ""deductive"" research process in academia, though most parts also are applicable to the ""inductive"" research process. Practical implications: It is important that the elements of the scholarly research process and the components of the report structure are thoroughly thought out in detail before too much investment in time and resources, as well as intellectual effort, have been made in order to avoid frustration and discontent. In addition, the potential journal outlets also need to be considered at an early stage of research. Originality/value: Transparent understanding and foresight of research processes, report structures and journal outlets provide essential and valuable insights for scholars. The author has striven to show that realizing the link between the scholarly research process, the scholarly report structure and the potential journal outlets available will assist in efforts to perform and communicate the outcome of scholarly studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Deductive; Inductive; Journals; Report structure; Research; Research process; Scholars; Study",,,,,,"Booth, W.C., Colomb, G.G., Williams, J.M., (2003) The Craft of Research, , The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL; Day, A., (1996) How to Get Research Published in Journals, , Gower, Aldershot; Lester, J.D., Lester Jr., J.D., (2005) Writing Research Papers - A Complete Guide, , Pearson Education, New York, NY; Rozakis, L., (1999) Writing Great Research Papers, , McGraw-Hill, London; Svensson, G., A counter-intuitive view of the deductive research process - clockwise versus anti-clockwise approaches (2009) European Business Review, 21 (2), pp. 191-196; Gardner, H., (1983) Frames of Mind - The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, , Basic Books, New York, NY","Svensson, G.; Oslo School of Management, Oslo, Norway; email: goran.svensson@hh.se",,,,,,,,0955534X,,,,"English","Eur.

This new book examines the way these constructs govern the production of wealth through 'uncertain' speculation and 'calculable' investment formulae.The way in which risk and uncertainty govern the minimisation of harms through insurance and through the uncertain practices of 'reasonable foresight' is discussed, and O Malley looks at the way these same techniques were historically forged out of moral and social beliefs about how to govern properly. In addition, the book analyzes is how, during this process, ideas such as 'contract' and distinctions between insurance and gambling were invented to order to 'properly' govern the risky and uncertain future. © O'Malley, P 2004.

Hence the surface, being the main habitat of bacteria in most fresh and newly processed seafoods, is an area of interest for efficient bacterial reduction with minimal thermal load. Recent findings in the area of surface decontamination of particular relevance for seafood are summarised, either as reported results for seafood, or as principles applicable to seafoods. In this chapter, the microbiological issues are described first, followed by the technologies and applications. However, the chapter separates the traditional physical/chemical methods from the emerging novel technologies, of which the latter typically lack published data for seafood, but are included to give some foresights into future developments. © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.","Acid; Chlorine; Dipping; Fish; Seafood; Steam; Surface decontamination",,,,,,"(1995) Acmsf Report on vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, , HMSO, London; Acuff, G., Izat, A.L., Finne, G., Microbial-flora of pond-reared tilapia (Tilapia aurea) held on ice (1984) Journal of Food Protection, 47, pp. 778-780; Al Qadiri, H.M., Al Alami, N.I., Lin, M., Al Holy, M., Cavinato, A.G., Rasco, B.A., Studying of the bacterial growth phases using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and multivariate analysis (2008) Journal of Rapid Methods and Automation in Microbiology, 16, pp. 73-89; Al Qadiri, H.M., Lin, M., Al Holy, M.A., Cavinato, A.G., Rasco, B.A., Detection of sublethal thermal injury in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (4000 to 600 cm-1 (2008) Journal of Food Science, 73, pp. M54-M61; Andrews, L.S., Keys, A.M., Martin, R.L., Grodner, R., Park, D.L., Chlorine dioxide wash of shrimp and crawfish: an alternative to aqueous chlorine (2002) Food Microbiology, 19, pp. 261-267; Annous, B.A., Kozempel, M.F., Surface pasteurization with hot water and steam (2006) Microbiology of fruits and vegetables, pp. 479-496. , Taylor and Francis, Boca Raton, FL, G.M.

In this paper, we review and estimate the renewable electricity potentials in France in a long term perspective, considering technical as well as social acceptability factors. Previous assessment studies are reviewed, and specific evaluations are conducted to estimate both the solar electricity potential on residential rooftops and the wind electricity potential in likelydevelopable areas. Potential effects on the grid power balance are examined for typical winter and summer days based on historical data sets. France has the resources to produce a large portion of its annual final electricity consumption with renewable energy. However, further analysis is needed to evaluate more in depth the influence of limiting factors such as the variability of certain resources, the distribution and transmission constraints, and the potential usage conflicts. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity; Foresight; France; Long term perspectives; Renewable energy",,,,,,"Directive 2009/28/ec on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (2009) Official Journal of the European Union, L140, pp. 16-62. , European Parliament and Council; Jacobson, M.Z., Delucchi, M.A., Providing all global energv with wind, water and solar power (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 1154-1169. , 1170-1190; Sun, M., Huld, T.A., Dunlop, E.D., Pv-gis: A web-based solar radiation database for the calculation of PV potential in Europe (2005) International Journal of Sustainable Energy, 24 (2), pp. 55-67; (2011) Bilan EnergStique de la France Pour 2010, , Service d'Observation et dc la Statistique (SOeS); (2009) Plan D'action National Cn Favour Dcs Energies Renouvelables, Periodc, , 2020en ('application dc la directive 2009/28/CE de l'Union europeenne); (2011) Les Français Ct les Energies Renouvelables, , BVA-ADEME, rapport d'etude; (2008) Base de Connaissance Sur Le Mode D'occupation Du Sol, , IAU-MOS; Bergamasco, L., Asinari, P., Scalable methodology for the photovoltaic solar energy potential assessment based on available roof surface area: Apphcation to piedmont region (2011) Solar Energy, 85, pp. 1041-1055. , Italy; (2009) Secteur Residenticl: Suivi Du Pare et des Consommations D'energies, , CEREN; Troen, I., Petersen, E.L., (1989) European Wind Atlas, , Rise National Laboratory.

Not only do students reap benefits from Quality Connection, but also school and office staff and administrators use DL in numerous capacities. Indeed, Quality Connection is slated for replication by other school divisions in Virginia. Although the program was developed originally to offer expanded curricula to students and training opportunities for staff, DL has had the ancillary effect of reprising the division’s long-term goals and revolutionizing short-term strategies.

A new experimental method based on information acceleration (IA) is also applied to improve prediction of future IS service strategies. Both explanation and prediction are important to IS research and these two behaviourally sound methods complement each other. Specifically, the combination of IA and discrete choice analysis removes misspecification artefacts from response variability and generates more accurate parameter estimates that better explain IS decision making. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Unfortunately, Parkinson did not have the foresight to wish that “the relief of this distressing malady” should last indefinitely. Soon after the introduction of levodopa, it became clear that its chronic use is associated with motor Ÿuctuations and dyskinesia that eventually occur in the majority of patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) and can be major causes of disability in their own right.2,3 Thus, paraphrasing Parkinson’s words, we are now confronted with the remaining challenge “to point out appropriate means to prevent or relieve the long-term complications of levodopa treatment.”. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Parkinson, J., (1817) An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, , Sherwood, Neely and Jones, London, U.K; Cotzias, G.C., Van, W.M., Schiffer, L.M., Aromatic amino acids and modification of parkinsonism (1967) N.

As such, any disruption in the infrastructure network poses a significant damage to society, therefore this paper presents a resilience analysis approach to evaluate the reliability of infrastructure networks so as to quantitatively determine the ability of a network to cope with complexity under disruption as well as to develop foresight in safety management. Under resilience analysis, an infrastructure network is modeled as an undirected graph with nodes and edges, and the resilience of the whole network can then be evaluated by the weighted sum of the resilience of all the reliable independent connection paths between all pairs of nodes. The proposed approach is also illustrated in a portion of a rail network, and the results indicate that the ability of the network to cope with complexity under disruption can be explicitly known. © 2012 IEEE.","Infrastructure; Network Theory; Reliability; Resilience Analysis","Circuit theory; Industrial engineering; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Analysis approach; Infrastructure; Infrastructure networks; Rail networks; Resilience Analysis; Safety management; Undirected graph; Weighted Sum; Complex networks",,,,,"Clinton, W.J., Executive order 13010-Critical infrastructure protection (1996) Federal Register, 61 (138), pp. 37347-37350; Lewis, T.G., (2006) Critical Infrastructure Protection Homeland Security, , John Wiley &Sons, New Jersey; Pederson, P., Dudenhoeffer, D., Hartley, S., Permann, M., Critical infrastructure interdependency modeling: A survey of US and international research (2006) Idaho National Laborator, p. 83415. , Idaho Falls, Idaho; Yusta, J.M., Correa, G.J., Lacal-Arantegui, R., Methodologies and applications for critical infrastructure protection: State-of-The-Art (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 6100-6119; Hollnagel, E., Woods, D.D., Leveson, N., (2006) Resilience Engineering Concepts and Precepts, , Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, UK; Vergano, L., Nunes, P.A.L.D., Analysis and evaluation of ecosystem resilience: An economic perspective with an application to the Venice lagoon (2007) Biodivers Conserv, 16, pp. 3385-3408; Scheffel, M.C., Gruber, C.G., Schwabe, T., Prinz, R.G., Optimal multi-topology routing for IP resilience (2006) Int.

The companies have become more open in their futures research process and have come down the ivory tower to practice a more interactive way of looking at the future. The required broad view of the future has also taught the companies not to just collect and analyze as much information as possible but also to give room to intuition and listen very good to external experts. Lastly, the companies more and more use their network to look for 'weak signals' in their business environment thereby attempting to make their companies much more agile so that having a very long view of the future is no longer a dominant approach. Overall, the research shows a contingency perspective towards looking at the future.

However, we will also explore new solution directions based on an integrative approach as proposed by the Dutch Royal Academy of Science foresight committee on renewable energy conversions. These alternative solutions include flexible coproduction and local production of chemicals and fuel that can also fulfill a storage function. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed generation; Energy storage; Micro grids; Renewable energy; Smart grids; System integration","Co-production; Critical issues; Demand side managements; Design and operations; High-capacity; Local production; Micro grid; Power balance; Power production; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Storage function; System integration; Virtual power plants; Distributed power generation; Electricity; Energy storage; Fuel storage; Solar energy; Smart power grids",,,,,"de Wit, J.H.W., (2007) Duurzaamheid duurt het langst.

It is found that although these theorists have various definitions of leadership, administration and management, when they have to distinguish types of leadership, they invariously place leadership over administration and management, and that within leadership, the moral imperative of leadership is the most significant and highest level of leadership, as compared to technical-rational leadership. There are some differences in perceiving whether professional leadership is close to or as a part of moral leadership, but the moral imperative of professional leadership is at the core of leadership, which is the source of insight, foresight and will provide vision and direction that would attract followership and transformational leadership. After the review of major leadership theories in the West and leading to such an observation, the author has found that this is also the essence of leadership ideas in Confucian philosophies, thus concluding that emphaising moral leadership is where Eastern and Western leadership thoughts concur. © 2012 2012 Taylor and Francis Group LLC.","Administration and leadership; Keyword moral leadership; Power and leadership; Servant leadership; Transformational leadership",,,,,,"Barnard, C., (1948) Organisation and Management, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Burkhardt, J., Spears, L.C., Servant-leadership and philanthropic institutions (2002) Focus on Leadership: Servant Leadership for the 21St Century, pp. 223-243. , L.

The study aims to explore the progress and foresight in microbicides development using research papers' analysis. The 317 records were downloaded from the PubMed with the search strategy: (i) ""Microbicide [ti]"" and (ii) ""HIV prevention[ti] + methods[ti] + women[ti]"" till November 2010. Majority of the papers (280, 88.33 %) appeared during the recent decade (2001-2010). Of the 133 publishing journals, only four journals, viz., Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Antimicrob Agents and Chemotherapy, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, and AIDS contributed one-fourths (80 papers, 25.24 %) of the total papers published by researchers from 22 countries with US on the top of the tally. The recent decade has witnessed considerable growth in research output in this field while a successful microbicide still remains elusive. Leading countries in terms of research output like the USA, UK, South Africa, and India are those often directly affected by HIV.

It also aims to assess drivers identified a decade ago on university futures. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews drivers, trends and scenarios. Findings: The paper finds first, globalization will likely continue but innovation will move to Chindia. Second, democratization has resulted by not as imagined a decade ago, rather, peer-to-peer or web 2.0 has changed the game. Three new scenarios are articulated: Wikipedia university; core-periphery reversed and incremental managerialism. Bliss for all remains an outlier. Practical implications: Asian-Pacific universities instead of adopting the used future of the core will find it wiser to innovate and create new visions as well as to develop new global ranking systems. Social implications: Traditional universities are the likely dinosaurs unable to thrive in a dramatically changing world. Increasing inequity in traditional western universities will likely further devalue higher education. New models of inclusion are required. Originality/value: The paper articulates new scenarios of the future, and assesses trends identified a decade ago.

Statements from the pen of theologians about the advantageous trade with the other world are by no means uncommon towards the end of the Middle Ages. In devotional literature, too, there is regularly talk of a profitable, meritorious acquisition, collection and accumulation of pious works which can be related as commendable wares to imperishable heavenly treasures. A typical example is how the much-read Imitatio Christi gives instructions for a well-prepared death. It is a product of the Dutch “Devotio Moderna” of the early fifteenth century and consequently grew out of the milieu of a flowering commercial culture. One can hear in the commercial maxim “time is money” – every period of time must be used profitably with clever, planned foresight – when the author warns his readers: “The present is the most valuable time [...].

It is still of high interest for genetic improvement, adjustment of production to feed availability, to market and reduction of unproductive periods. Detection of oestrous behaviour in cyclic females, synchronization of conceptions and increase of the potency of diffusion of sires are three common objectives among species. The various situations of reproductive systems, which are reviewed here, are very different among the various livestock systems in the world, because of intrinsic properties of species, but also because of the various degrees of intensification of the livestock systems themselves. A clear tendency appears to continue increasing productivity by improving reproductive efficiency, developing new and sustainable techniques without hormones, and continuing to develop AI and reproductive biotechnologies. Future areas of investment in research could be, first, the physiological and ethological bases of the socio-sexual inter-relationships between animals, second the genetic control of reproductive traits, third increasing the efficiency of classical and new reproductive biotechnologies and fourth engineering new and innovative reproductive techniques to be used in farm conditions. These reproductive techniques should be developed respecting the three pillars of sustainability: environment, economy and society. Thus, they should be included within the livestock systems in which they are supposed to be applied and which should be assessed for sustainability.","Mammals; Reproduction; Sustainability","Animalia; Mammalia",,,,,"Alejandrino, A.L., Asaad, C.O., Malabayabas, B., De Vera, A.C., Herrera, M.S., Deocaris, C.C., Ignacio, L.M., Palo, L.P., Constraints on dairy cattle productivity at the smallholder level in the Philippines (1999) Preventive Veterinary Medicine, 38 (2-3), pp. 167-178. , DOI 10.1016/S0167-5877(98)00122-6, PII S0167587798001226; Ali Al Ahmad, M.Z., Chebloune, Y., Bouzar, B.A., Baril, G., Bouvier, F., Chatagnon, G., Leboeuf, B., Fieni, F., Lack of risk of transmission of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) after an appropriate embryo transfer procedure (2008) Theriogenology, 69 (4), pp. 408-415. , DOI 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.10.009, PII S0093691X07006115; Al-Shorepy, S.A., Notter, D.R., Response to Selection for Fertility in a Fall-Lambing Sheep Flock (1997) Journal of Animal Science, 75 (8), pp. 2033-2040; Asmussen, T., Herd Navigator or ""how to benefit from frequent measurements"" (2010) ICAR Technical Series, pp. 291-293; Barbat, A., Le Mezec, P., Ducrocq, V., Mattalia, S., Fritz, S., Boichard, D., Ponsart, C., Humblot, P., Female fertility in french dairy breeds: Current situation and strategies for improvement (2010) Journal of Reproduction and Development, 56, pp. S15-S21; Baxter, E.M., Lawrence, A.B., Edwards, S.A., Alternative farrowing systems: Design criteria for farrowing systems based on the biological needs of sows and piglets (2011) Animal, 5, pp. 580-600; Benoit, M., Tournadre, H., Dulph, J.P., Laignel, G., Prache, S., Cabaret, J., Is intensification of reproduction rhythm sustainable in an organic sheep production system?

Mindful of this, in what follows, I provide some attention to how humanism as an approach to ethics might serve to enhance the life options of communities. In the spring of 2005, former US ambassador Jonathan Dean spoke to a gathering of international peace activists in Cuenca, Spain about the work of Global Action to Prevent War. He addressed our hopes for peace, our aversion to war, and our commitment to respond to crimes against humanity with foresight and creativity. He grounded his proposals in a shift begun in the late nineteenth century within the European peace societies. Rather than expecting or seeking a fundamental change in human nature, Dean claimed that “the peace societies ultimately gave priority to mechanisms and measures to constrain war over intellectual [and moral] arguments to end war.” This turn to a constructive realism is absent in much of the peace movement today in the United States, and yet, such a stance might have great potential for implementing our proposals for enduring peace and sustainable security. CONTEXT CONSIDERED A humanist approach to social ethics and public policy that follows the guidelines of Ambassador Dean echoes many insights of President Obama's Nobel Peace Prize speech without, however, relying on a contrast between the “isness” of the human condition with an eternal “oughtness” that forever confronts us. © Anthony B.

Obesity and its comorbidities not only subtract from quality of overall life, but also claim a substantial cost to life. In this edition of 'Then and now', two seminal papers by D.L. Coleman, 'The influence of genetic background on the expression of the obese (ob) gene in the mouse' and 'Effects of parabiosis of obese with diabetes and normal mice', which featured in Diabetologia in 1973, are appraised for their merit and foresight regarding the present eruption of research into what has consequently been labelled 'the metabolic syndrome'. These two studies determined that a thenunknown circulating factor was responsible for the obese/ diabetic state of the ob/ob mouse by using a parabiosis model.

Section 5.1 presents methods and instruments that innovation networks use. The findings are based on a sample of 107 innovation networks in Germany. While this first section describes methods and instruments that are used by innovation networks in general, Sect. 5.2 is focussing specifically on the methods and measures employed by innovation communities. The chapter differentiates the methods and measures, which have been used in the five innovation cases (see Sects. 3.5–3.9), according to five basic tasks in the management of cooperative innovation projects: (1) Process Support, (2) Foresight, (3) Idea Generation, (4) Technology and Market Analysis and (5) Stakeholder Interaction. Section 5.3 brings together empirical and practical knowledge as to which methods and measures can be used by innovation and network managers for the initiation and development of innovation communities. The findings are summarized in a “toolbox”. Within the InnoCo project, many tools have been tried and tested in innovation community development. Special attention has been given to two methodological approaches which are as important for the development of innovation communities as they are methodologically complex. These are: systemic innovation coaching of innovation communities, and Delphi-based scenario development in innovation networks. These methods are presented in Sects. 5.4 and 5.5. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,,,,,,"Adams, M.E., Day, G.S., Dougherty, D., Enhancing new product development performance: An organizational learning perspective (1998) J Prod Innovat Manage, 15 (5), pp. 403-422; Barczak, G., Griffin, A., Kahn, K.B., PERSPECTIVE: Trends and drivers of success in NPD practices: Results of the 2003 PDMA best practices study (2009) J Prod Innovat Manage, 26 (1), pp. 3-23; Bidault, F., Cummings, T., Innovating through alliances: Expectations and limitations (1994) R&D Manage, 24 (1), pp. 33-45; Brown, B.B., (1968) Delphi Process: A Methodology Used for the Elicitation of Opinions of Experts, , An earlier paper published by RAND (Document No: P-3925, 1968, 15 pp).

These difficulties are exacerbated when, for example, for the long-term development scenarios, the design of entire sets of forecasts' trajectories is required and they have to reach numerous time horizons. Such a problem occurred during the implementation of the energy foresight for Poland, which required the construction of renewable energy production forecasts for the years 2010-2050. Possible solutions to this problem are the main aspects of this article. The paper presents methods of formal prediction models' construction in the absence of the past data. Subjective opinions of experts on the development of a projected phenomenon were used to evaluate the parameters of such models. Thus, those models are called subjective. There are considered four subjective prediction models: a development trend model, Rogers's diffusion model and Bass's diffusion model, ADBUDG model. On the basis of each of the models, as an illustration of theoretical considerations, were built predictions of energy production from renewable energy sources in Poland in the years 2010-2050. In the conclusions part, the individual models are evaluated from the standpoint of their usefulness as well as their advantages and disadvantages in building long-term forecasts of new technologies' development are discussed.","Experts' forecasts; Subjective models","Forecasting; Information management; Mathematical models; Sustainable development; Development trends; Energy productions; Individual models; Long-term development; Long-term forecast; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy technologies; Renewable energy resources",,,,,"Armstrong, J.S., Collopy, F., Integration of statistical methods and judgment for time series forecasting: Principles from empirical research (1998), pp. 269-293. , Forecasting with Judgment, Wright G. and Goodwin P.

Nonetheless roadmaps can be applied to exploratory studies as well. The latter are aimed at identifying key potentially transformative events, whose dynamics could be influenced by a wide range of externalities. Trends in some fields appear to dominate and shape movement in other areas. Roadmapping allows visualizing and assessing probabilities of cross-impact between various areas of forecasting thus identifying possible scenario bifurcations as well as new risks and opportunities. This paper describes the exploratory roadmap being developed for the Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight 2030. According to that roadmap, evolution to 2020 closely follows macroeconomic trends. However, in regard to technological development, either the «rapid inflation» scenario or the «gradual way out of the crisis» one, the rate is the same, in our view. After 2020, the dominating role in evolution is expected to shift to «global technologies». These technologies are grouped into six thematic areas according to countries' S&T priorities, i.e. energy, transport, information and communications technologies (ICTs), medicine, nanotechnologies, and production systems. The most influential scenario bifurcation in the roadmap emerges from the field of energy. Depending on the actual scenario - «the expansion of alternative energy sources» or «the widespread use of non-conventional hydrocarbon fuels» - the global economy will experience rapid growth or slow stagnation respectively.","Exploratory forecast; Long-term forecasting; Macroeconomic trends; Normative forecast; Scenario bifurcation; Scenarios; Technology roadmaps",,,,,,"Beznosyuk, M., Harsh landing (2012) CleanTech, 9 (4), pp. 2011-2012. , http://novostinauki.ru/news/43118/, winter, (accessed 11 April 2012); (2010) Ideas.

Despite efforts by governments worldwide to stabilize the system and return to business as usual, the future remains unclear. Times of crisis are opportunities to introspect and to question deeply the foundations of society, culture and education. According to Einstein, ""problems cannot be solved by the level of awareness that created them"". The hegemony of a critical/rational worldview in modern society, science and education results in the shaping of an artificially narrow, ""money and machines"" future that diminishes universal values and deeper psycho-spiritual needs of human beings. Such a narrow focus of policy will likely aggravate social and psychological problems. The solution according to the author lies in the concept of Deep Futures, which is the base for the emerging discipline of Postconventional Futures Studies. Deep Futures has evolved from earlier expressions of Futures Studies. Deep Futures utilises recognised Futures methodologies and philosophies, but expands the depth of analysis and insight by incorporating additional tools and other ways of knowing not traditionally utilized by Futures practitioners. A primary function of Deep Futures is to act as a provocation to dominant discourses. It provides an enhanced capacity for dissent - to challenge conventional Foresight and Futures work. Deep Futures thus allows overcoming boundaries of the critical/rational worldview, deepening the perceptions of the past, present, and future, and developing more performing strategies. The author examines the tools and processes of Deep Futures in detail and provides practical examples for their application.","Critical rationality; Deep Futures; Money and machines futures; Other ways of knowing; Postconventional Futures Studies",,,,,,"Anthony, M., Education for transformation: Integrated intelligence in the knowledge economy and beyond (2005) Journal of Futures Studies, 9 (3), pp. 31-35; Anthony, M., Integrated intelligence and the psycho-spiritual imperatives of mechanistic science (2005) Journal of Futures Studies, 10 (1), pp. 31-48; Anthony, M., A genealogy of the western rationalist hegemony (2006) Journal of Futures Studies, 10 (4), pp. 25-38; Anthony, M., Rubezhi teorii intellekta (2007) Frontiers of Intelligence, 4, pp. 4-p18. , Foresight-Russia; Anthony, M., Harmonic circles: A new futures tool (2007) Foresight, 9 (5), pp. 23-34; Anthony, M., (2008) Integrated Intelligence, , Rotterdam: Sense Publishers; Anthony, M., (2010) Deep Futures beyond Money Machines, pp. 26-41. , Risk Assessment & Horizon Scanning Nanyang Technological University Singapore; Anthony, M., Civilisational clashes and harmonic circles (2010) Futures, 42 (6), pp. 553-564; Anthony, M., Integrated inquiry: Mystical intuition and research (2011) The Open Information Science Journal, 3, pp. 80-88; Anthony, M., (2012) How to Channel A PhD, MindFutures, , available in eBook formats only; Blackmore, S., (2003) Consciousness: An Introduction, , Oxford: Hodder & Stoughton; Bussey, M., Six shamanic concepts: Charting the between in futures work (2009) Foresight, 11 (2), pp. 29-42; Carr, N., (2010) What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, , New York: Norton; Ching, F., (2009) Learning from the Past, , South China Morning Post 29 July 2009; Curry, A., Shultz, W., Roads less travelled: Different methods, different futures (2009) Journal of Futures Studies, 13 (4), pp. 35-60; Dator, J., The unholy trinity plus one (2009) Journal of Futures Studies, 13 (3), pp. 33-47; Dawkins, R., Egoistichny gen (1993) Egoistic Gene, , Oscow: ir; Dawkins, R., (2006) The God Delusion, , London: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; De Bono, E., (2009) Think! before It's Too Late, , London: Random House; De Grasse Tyson, N., Coming to our Senses (2001) Natural History, 110 (2), p. 84; Eisler, R., A multi-linear theory of cultural evolution (2004) The Great Adventure: Toward A Fully Human Theory of Evolution, , (ed.

It is important that mass communication, with its virtual product is related to two other sectors: telecommunications and information and communication technology. Technological transformations affect these three industries alike; the growth of bandwidth, convergence of terminals and growth of their computational performance are transforming products and markets in all three. Long-term trends in these markets have been well defined by a range of industrial experts. The conclusion of the paper provides recommendations for the revision of public policy. The authors note only a few new tendencies in services and products. However, wide diffusion of these trends due to cheap technologies will lead to radical changes in the sector. New markets will appear as a result of expansion and adjustment of industrial relations between agents, previously independent of each other. Key trends are the abandonment of linear-media in favor of ""user-controlled"" consumption, with a growing amount of content produced by the user, and the spread of social interactions. The trends are interrelated and determine the transformation of business models, the sources of income, and the value of goods produced by the media industry. The most negative trend according to experts is ""deprofessionalization"" of content, which poses a risk for institutionalized forms of media. With such turbulent changes regulation in mass communications will inevitably undergo transformation. Henceforth it will not be able to rely upon content filtering and setting quotas. Instead the regulation should be built upon enabling a diversity of information sources to create the news agenda at the request of the audience.","Content; Foreñasting; Information technologies; Long-term trends; Mass communications; Media market; Scenario analysis",,,,,,"Anderson, C., (2006) The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More, , New York: Hyperion; Booth, P., (2010) Digital Fandom, , New York: Peter Lang Publishing; Bradshaw, P., (2008) News Distribution in A New Media World, , http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2008/01/02/a-model-for-the-21st-century- newsroom-pt4-pushpullpass-distribution, online journalism blog Available at accessed 2 November 2012; Castells, M., (1996) Information Age 1: Rise of the Network Society, , Oxford: Wiley; Castells, M., (1997) Information Age 2: The Power of Identity, , Oxford: Wiley; Castells, M., (1998) Information Age 3: End of Millennium, , Oxford: Wiley; Castells, M., (2009) Communication Power, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Castells, M., (2012) Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age, , New York: Polity; (2011) Cisco VNI Forecast San Jose Cisco, , http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ ns827/white-paper-c11-520862.html, Cisco Available at accessed 9 October 2012; Evans, E., (2011) Transmedia Television: Audiences New Media and Daily Life, , Oxford: Routledge; Televidenie v Rossii: Sostoyanie, tendentsii i perspektivy razvitiya (otraslevoi doklad) (2012) TV in Russia: State-of-Art, Trends and Future Outlook, , FAPMC industry report (ed.

The methodological approach used for scheduling N-fertilization is based on forecast of the daily amount of N uptake by the crop and of N available into the root zone in order to fulfil N-crop requirements by the soundest N supply to the soil, as follows: N-fertilization = N-crop uptake-N-soil availability. The DSS works on a daily basis through a) the estimation of a daily dry mass accumulation on the basis of cumulated degree days; b) the derivation of the daily N-uptake by the crop as a function of the estimated accumulation of DM using specific N-dilution curves; c) the estimation of the daily N-available in the soil intercepted by the roots (mineral and mineralizable); d) the daily N-balance (N-uptake-N-available in the soil); e) make a decision on the N-application rate and application scheduling on the base of the balance result and on the moment of the growing cycle. The program allows to simulate crop growth by using historical meteorological data (multi-annual averaged daily minimum and maximum temperature) specific of the area where the farm is located and thus producing a foresight N-fertilization plan. © ISHS.","Crop growth model; Degree days; Fertilization management; N dilution curve","Cynara scolymus",,,,,"Addiscott, T.M., Whitmore, A.P., Powlson, D.S., Farming, fertilizers and the nitrate problem (1991) CAB International, p. 170. , Wallingford, UK; Boiffin, J., Keli Zagbahi, J., Sebillotte, M., Systemes de culture et statut organique des sols dans le Noyonnais: Application du modele de Henin-Dupuis (1986) Agronomie, 6, pp. 437-446; Gímenez, M., Martínez, J., Ferrández, M., Oltra, M.A., Madrid, R., Rodríguez, V., Rodríguez, O., Initial values of DRIS norms for artichoke cv.

If other relevant drivers are considered at all, expert judgment is often used to create scenarios and the underlying logic is not always apparent. In this paper we describe an algorithm-based method for developing quantitative future scenarios of the built environment in East Anglia, England with a focus on a coastal management unit, designated sub-cell 3b. The four UK Foresight socioeconomic storylines were inputs to the study: World Markets, Local Stewardship, Global Sustainability, and National Enterprise. On the basis of estimated regional demand, the distributions of new residential and nonresidential properties were calculated under all scenarios using a GIS-based multicriteria analysis. The buildings are distributed across a large swath of East Anglia using four attraction factors with different weightings to reflect the storylines. The factors are the existing settlements, transport networks, coastline, and floodplain. The results show increases in the number of residential and nonresidential properties within the coastal flood plain of sub-cell 3b under all socioeconomic scenarios, especially under World Markets and National Enterprise. These increases may lead to a significant increase in flood risk and to a lesser extent in the erosion risk in the study site. More importantly, the multicriteria method presented here demonstrates an algorithm-based approach that provides feasible and flexible tools for the development of socioeconomic scenarios in the context of impact and risk assessment. Hence, the scenario assumptions are explicit, reproducible and easily adjustable, as required. © 2012 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.","Built environment; Climate change; Flood risk; GIS; Multicriteria analysis; Socioeconomic scenarios","algorithm; climate change; coastal zone; coastal zone management; floodplain; GIS; multicriteria analysis; risk assessment; East Anglia; England; United Kingdom",,,,,"Allen, J., Lu, K., Modeling and prediction of future urban growth in the Charleston Region of South Carolina: A GIS-based integrated approach (2003) Conservation Ecology, 8 (2). , http://www.consecol.org/vol8/iss2/art2/; Andersson, C., Lindgren, K., Rasmussen, S., White, R., Urban growth simulation from first principles (2002) Physical Review, 66 (2), pp. 0262041-0262049; Barredo, J.I., Kasando, M., McCormick, N., Lavalle, C., Modelling dynamic spatial processes: Simulation of urban future scenarios through cellular automata (2003) Landscape and Urban Planning, 64, pp. 145-160; Berkhout, F., Hertin, J., Foresight future scenarios: Developing and applying a participative strategic planning tool (2002) Global Modeling Initiative, 37, pp. 37-52. , (Summer); Berkhout, F., Hertin, J., Jordan, A., Socio-economic futures in climate change impacts assessment: Using scenarios as learning machines (2002) Global Environmental Change, 12, pp. 83-95; Carter, T.R., Jones, R.N., Lu, X., Bhadwal, S., Conde, C., Mearns, L.O., O'Neill, B.C., Zurek, M.B., New assessment methods and the characterisation of future conditions (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

It is not, however, easy to decipher the historical process and it may appear difficult to add anything whatever to what has already been written by Hegel, Marx and many others on universal history. That is, however, what a Russian orientalist, Igor Diakonoff, has attempted in a book which appeared in Russia in 1994 and was translated into English five years later as The Paths of History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999). Bernard Cazes has read this highly original work with great interest. Alongside an account of the atypical career of its Russian author, he presents Diakonoff's re-reading of history here, driven as it is by the desire to establish whether certain non-material (in Marx's sense) aspects, present in certain civilizations, were not found elsewhere. Diakonoff proposes a break-down of universal history into eight phases, the originality of this lying largely in the transition mechanism from one phase to another. This is based mainly on psycho-sociological (changes of values, for example) and technological factors (particularly in the field of armaments). Lastly, Cazes highlights the author's comments on the finitude of our planet and his warning against the risks of extinction facing the human species in the relatively short term if nothing is done to check the course of history seen in its current, eighth, ""postcapitalist"" phase.",,,,,,,"Diakonoff, I.M., (1999) The Paths of History, p. 368. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, (traduction de Puti Istorii: ot Arevncishe%o chelovek do nashikh dnei.

Four randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials -VALIANT, EPHESUS, OPTIMAAL, and CAPRICORN evaluated pharmacologic intervention in a total of 28,771 high-risk patients following acute MI complicated with signs of heart failure or evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. The demographic profiles of the 4 study cohorts were similar. The High-Risk MI Database Initiative constructed a common database by merging the data captured by these 4 large trials. The merged data set did not contain the randomized study treatment, so no comparisons could be made between the agents investigated. A total of more than 17,600 subjects experienced a cardiovascular end point. Approximately 5100 deaths occurred, and more than 15,700 subjects experienced a hospitalization. The primary objectives of this initiative were to use this large database to define more precisely the prognostic profile of this high-risk population, to perform rigorous, adequately-sized, subset analyses, to provide epidemiologic information and event rate estimation based on baseline demographics. The methodological challenges and limitations of such an analyses are discussed. It is proposed that some thoughtful foresight and planning could enable us to use the large number of clinical events that accrue during randomized clinical trials to address questions of scientific and clinical interest. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Clinical outcomes; High-Risk MI database initiative; Myocardial infarction; Randomized clinical trials","article; cohort analysis; data analysis; data base; funding; heart infarction; high risk population; human; information processing; methodology; prognosis; systematic review; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Databases as Topic; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Prognosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Statistics as Topic; Young Adult",,,,,"(2011) Global atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control, p. 164. , http://www.who.int/en/, WHO, Geneva, Available at:, World Health Organization, World Heart Federation, World Stroke Organization (Eds.); Pfeffer, M.A., McMurray, J.J.V., Velasquez, E.J., Valsartan, captopril, or both in myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or both (2003) N Engl J Med, 349, pp. 1893-1906; Pitt, B., Remme, W., Zannad, F., Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1309-1321. , for the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study Investigators; Dickstein, K., Kjekshus, J., Effects of losartan and captopril on mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction: the OPTIMAAL randomized trial (2002) Lancet, 360, pp. 752-760; The CAPRICORN Investigators Effect of carvedilol on outcome after myocardial infarction in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction: the CAPRICORN randomized trial (2001) Lancet, 257, pp. 1385-1390","Dickstein, K.; University of Bergen, Stavanger University Hospital, Armauer Hansensvei 20, 4011 Stavanger, Norway; email: kenneth.dickstein@med.uib.no",,,,,,,,00330620,,PCVDA,"22226005","English","Prog.

In 1935, with United States in the throes of the Depression, the nation's rise to superpower status seemed unlikely. Congress reflected the public's deeply isolationist mood, enacting the first of a series of Neutrality Acts intended to keep the nation out of another European conflict. The US military, other than its navy, did not reflect the nation's latent power. Most Americans neither expected nor desired world power. Yet in the space of just a single decade, this situation had completely altered. By 1945, the United States was one of the world's two acknowledged superpowers. Its powerful armed forces had played a major role in the defeat of the Axis in battles spanning the globe. Its economy was by far and away the most powerful in the world. And American diplomacy in large measure shaped the postwar world - a world the United States would dominate in nearly every major category of power and influence. These developments did not happen accidentally. They were, rather, the result of foresight and the creation of a successful strategy that guided American actions, from the neutrality of the interwar period to final victory in 1945. The architect was Franklin D. Roosevelt, a skillful politician who understood both domestic constraints and international realities in crafting American strategy. Roosevelt, ably advised by army chief of staff, General George C. Marshall and the other members of the joint chiefs of staff (JCS), skillfully guarded America's neutrality, carefully managed its entry into the Second World War, and deftly shaped the contours of the postwar world - and did so without the massive national security bureaucracy that guides current administrations in their handling of foreign policy and military affairs. © Williamson Murray and Richard Hart Sinnreich 2014.",,,,,,,"Morton, L., Germany First: The Basic Concept of Allied Strategy in World War II (2007) Command Decisions, , Kent Roberts Greenfield, ed., Annapolis, MD; Germany First, pp. 21-23; Henry, G., Gole, The Road to Rainbow: Army Planning for Global War, 1934-1940 (Annapolis (2003) MD; Emerson, W., Franklin Roosevelt as Commander-in-Chief in World War II Military Affairs, pp. 1958-1959. , Winter; Relyea, H.C., The Executive Office of the President: An Historical Overview (2008) Congressional Research Service, , http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-606.pdf, For an examination of the formation and growth of the Executive Office of the President from 1939 to 2008, 26 November; Matloff, M., Snell, E.M., (1953) Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare, 1941, pp. 7-8. , Washington; Roosevelt had served as assistant secretary of the navy from 1913 to 1920 and was therefore well attuned to the importance of sea power to US security; Mitchell Simpson, B., (1989) Admiral Harold R.

He developed a career as a safety consultant specializing in the human factors aspects of accident causation. Barry is a Fellow of the Safety and Reliability Society.The passing of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill in the UK and increasing public and investor pressure for good Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility, means organizations now, more than ever, need to ensure they do all they can to prevent major accidents. However, past experience shows that just implementing safety management systems is not enough and this book makes the case for a more holistic and ethical approach to improving corporate systems as a whole.Preventing Corporate Accidents shows how major accidents can result from human error and defects in corporate systems. The book describes accident prevention strategies, from safety culture, safety management systems, foresight and planning to safety regulations, corporate ethics, corporate social responsibility and the learning organization. Barry Whittingham illustrates with international case studies from various industries how and why these defences have failed in the past, and more importantly, how to strengthen corporate systems to prevent future major accidents.The case studies include:• The loss of the space shuttle Columbia• Infant heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary• The Davis-Besse nuclear power plant incident• The fire and explosion at the Conoco-Phillips Humber oil refinery• Herald of Free Enterprise and Southall rail accident manslaughter prosecutions © 2008, R.B.

But this book argues that this does not place it beyond the reach of a science that can help to explain and perhaps even to predict social behaviour. As a system made up of many interacting agents – people, groups, institutions and governments, as well as physical and technological structures such as roads and computer networks – society can be regarded as a complex system. In recent years, scientists have made great progress in understanding how such complex systems operate, ranging from animal populations to earthquakes and weather. These systems show behaviours that cannot be predicted or intuited by focusing on the individual components, but which emerge spontaneously as a consequence of their interactions: They are said to be ‘self-organized’. Attempts to direct or manage such emergent properties generally reveal that ‘top-down’ approaches, which try to dictate a particular outcome, are ineffectual, and that what is needed instead is a ‘bottom-up’ approach that aims to guide self-organization towards desirable states. This book shows how some of these ideas from the science of complexity can be applied to the study and management of social phenomena, including traffic flow, economic markets, opinion formation and the growth and structure of cities. Building on these successes, the book argues that the complex-systems view of the social sciences has now matured sufficiently for it to be possible, desirable and perhaps essential to attempt a grander objective: To integrate these efforts into a unified scheme for studying, understanding and ultimately predicting what happens in the world we have made. Such a scheme would require the mobilization and collaboration of many different research communities, and would allow society and its interactions with the physical environment to be explored through realistic models and large-scale data collection and analysis. It should enable us to find new and effective solutions to major global problems such as conflict, disease, financial instability, environmental despoliation and poverty, while avoiding unintended policy consequences. It could give us the foresight to anticipate and ameliorate crises, and to begin tackling some of the most intractable problems of the twenty-first century. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,,,,,,"Helbing, D., (2012) Social Self-Organization, , Springer, Berlin; Buchanan, M., (2007) The Social Atom, , Bloomsbury, London; Ball, P., (2004) Critical Mass, , Heinemann, London; Johnson, N., (2007) Two ’s Company, Three is Complexity, , Oneworld Publications, London; Miller, J., Page, S.E., (2007) Complex Adaptive Systems, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Epstein, J.M., Axtell, R., (1996) Building Artificial Societies, , Brookings Institution Press, Washington DC; Schweiteer, F., (1997) Self-Organization of Complex Structures: From Individual to Collective Dynamics, , Gordon & Breach, London; Helbing, D., Pluralistic modeling of complex systems (2010) Science & Culture, 76, pp. 315-329; Bak, P., Tang, C., Wiesenfeld, K., Self-organized criticality: An explanation of 1/f noise (1987) Phys.

While progress has been made in the implementation of mechanisms to promote innovation (Agendas regional and sectoral agreements Competitiveness Foresight exercises, Network of Innovative Business, Meetings University - Business - State), the reality is there is still much to build in the capabilities of innovation in organizations in the region. The need to generate a new model of innovation management is also related to a paradigm shift in the convergence being represented ICT and Social Networks, and by extension, a set of rules associated with new forms of relationships (between individuals and organizations) , new social patterns, new forms of access and use of knowledge.

The projects resulted in the evaluation of current methods for obtaining and processing scanning data and new conceptual thinking that may bridge the gap between scanning activities and policy-making. This paper provides an overview of conceptual thinking in two projects, SESTI and FAR Horizon. The key thinking is about emerging issues and aboutimaginative or potential wild cards, both considered to be potential storylines for future development or events that require policy action. Storylines come close to the concept of future narratives, as used in the policy discourse regarding aging in the Netherl and s. The shows that narratives are used by policymakers when they fit a particular strategy, but that the narratives must compete with both present-day (experienced ""past reality"") and future stories in policy discourse. The author describes strong ""future"" narratives and gives special attention those that include imaginative wild cards. The communicative strength of a future narrative (and the included issue) is decisive for its uptake in the discourse (in policy and business communities). However, this strength is only partly connected to its scientific or factual evidence base, since it may contain many elements that are not rational to make it strong. The paper is concerned with what makes a ""strong"" narrative. Next to the authority of the messenger and the interests of the receiver, its psychological and emotional appeal to the audience and its historical context make it persuasive. Examplesare given to show that future narratives are used to influence policy debates and decision making. Some have even succeeded in shaping the future to the interest of the author or for the benefit of society. The argument is that strong imaginative wild cards under the right conditions can have a powerful shaping effect, sometimes as shaping as that of real wild cards on the future.","Early warning; Emerging issues; Horizon scanning; Weak signals; Wild cards",,,,,,"Chilton, P.A., (2004) Analyzing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice, , London: Routledge; Friedemann, F., Pre-earthquake signals: Underlying physical processes (2011) Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, , (in print); Georghiou, L., Cassingena Harper, J., Miles, I., Popper, R., (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Hiltunen, E., Good sources of weak signals: Global study of where futurists look for weak signals (2008) Journal of Futures Studies, 12 (4), pp. 21-42; Loveridge, D., (2009) Foresight: The Art and Science of Anticipating the Future, , New York: Routledge; Markley, O., Staying resilient in a wild-card world (2011) Journal of the Institute of Noetic Science, (6); Morrison, J.L., Environmental scanning (1992) A Primer for New Institutional Researchers, pp. 86-99. , (eds.

Design/methodology/approach: The developed global model is based on a cognitive map composed of 28 factors. Among these factors two are independent, namely human consciousness and living standard. These two factors represent the most important levers of control within the designed model. Two approaches to scenario development have been applied, so that the comparison of the results between conventional fuzzy method and dynamic fuzzy method could give some further insights about global climate development and sustainability, as well as about differences between the two approaches. Findings: Results of the first model (no-time-delay in cause-effect relation) show that in general there is no absolute convergence to a single vector C(tn+1) for various initial values for C(0). But an interesting phenomenon of cyclical convergence of the model was observed, which coincides with the empirical research results that observe cycles in the climate change awareness and environmental impact. In the second model, time-delay in the adjacency matrix was considered during the iteration. An interesting phenomenon of cyclical convergence of this model was observed as well. In two antimetric cases the authors have observed the phenomenon of two cycles, where the second, final cycle is developing after the occurrence of the first. Practical implications: The paper can be of interest for foresight practitioners and policy makers who want to employ a hybrid approach to scenario development and use it as a learning device. Originality/value: The paper presents a different approach, based on dynamic fuzzy cognitive maps, to future scenarios development related to climate warning. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Analytic hierarchy process; Climatology; Delphi method; Dynamic fuzzy cognitive maps; Integrated global model; Multi-cyclical stability; Scenarios","Analytic hierarchy process; Climate change; Climatology; Cognitive systems; Decision making; Environmental impact; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Iterative methods; Sustainable development; Time delay; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Delphi method; Design/methodology/approach; Fuzzy cognitive map; Global modeling; Human consciousness; Scenario development; Scenarios; Climate models",,,,,"Adler, M., Ziglio, E., (1995) Gazing into the Oracle: The Delphi Method and Its Application to Social Policy and Public Health, , Jessica Kingsley Publishers, London; Pachauri, R.K., Reisinger, A., (2007) Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report, , Core Writing Team (Eds.), IPCC, Geneva; Eden, C., Ackermann, F., (1998) Making Strategy - The Journey of Strategic Management, , Sage, London; Huff, A.S., (1990) Mapping Strategic Thought, , Wiley, Chichester; Kosko, B., (1997) Fuzzy Engineering, , Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Laukkanen, M., Conducting casual mapping research: Opportunites and challenges (1998) Managerial and Organisational Cognition, pp. 168-209. , Eden, C., Spender, J.C.

Bauer focused on the unique path of religious, economic and institutional developments in a very ‘long’ sixteenth century, from the end of the fifteenth to the beginning of the seventeenth century. The period of papal finances, which had begun in 1417 with the return from Avignon, concluded with the Tridentine Council. The Reformation had upset not only the consciences of the believers, but also the traditional spiritual income, which in the end was regularly guaranteed only by the Italian clergy. In late sixteenth century the spiritual yield still represented a good 20 per cent of all pontifical earnings, but the percentage was on a steep descent. The Apostolic Chamber was obliged to find alternative sources of financial support, more so because the city of Rome, as the shop window of Catholicism, had to demonstrate to the Protestant world its monuments, its welfare and its financial solidity. Internal and external wars, as always, soaked up government coffers, though military costs were not as high for the Church as they were in other Italian regional states. However, on the international stage, the maintenance of alliances was very expensive, as seen in 1598, when a contingency sent into Hungary to aid against the Turks had cost 1,500,000 scudi, almost a whole year’s worth of income. With the conquest of Ferrara, at the end of the century, the extent of the Pontifical State in Italy was second only to the Kingdom of Naples. The annexation of Urbino in 1631 and a few years later that of the much more economically important dukedom of Castro, consolidated a territory that would remain unchanged until the Treaty of Tolentino (1797). Showing considerable foresight, the Apostolic Chamber entrusted the management of the provincial treasury to major Florentine and Genovese bankers, in this way weakening the power of the local feudal aristocracy and extending the area of tax collection. In Rome, the College of Cardinals lost its traditional political role and state affairs were presented to the Consistory only when the Pope and his inner circle had already made decisions. If state absolutism could rely upon trouble-free relations with the provinces, it required the full possession of the capital city. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,,,,,"Bauer, C., Die epochen der p ä pstfinanz (1928) Historische Zeitschrift, 138, pp. 457-503; Gardi, A., (1986) La Fiscalit à Pontii Cia Tra Medioevo Ed Et àmoderna, 33, pp. 509-557. , Societ à e storia; Partner, P., (1980) Papal financial Policy in the Renaissance and Counter-Reformation, 88, p. 47. , Pastand Present; Grisar, I., P ä pstliche finanzen, nepotismus und kirchenrecht unter urban viii (1943) Miscellanea Historiae Pontii Ciae, 7, pp. 221-222; Rosa, M., (1987) La –Scarsella Di Nostrosignore—: Aspetti Della Fiscalit &#x00E0; Spirituale Pontii Cia Nell’ et &#x00E0; Moderna, 38, pp. 830-834. , Societ à e storia; Capra, C., (1999) The Italian States in the Early Modern Period, p. 438. , R.

Studies have shown that with this warming trend, sea ice and glaciers are melting and thus sea levels are rising. However, the situation might be more severe than originally anticipated. The ice is retreating a lot more quickly than was projected, with an absolute low point in 2007. a second low point occurred in 2008 and September 2010 provided us with the third lowest sea ice extent in the satellite record. Maybe even more important than the decline in sea ice extent, is the fact that the ice volume is decreasing with it. The ice pack is becoming more and more vulnerable to melting due to the decline in the amount of old, thick ice and it appears that five-year or older ice has nearly completely disappeared from the Arctic. This Arctic melt opens up new possibilities for (trans) Arctic shipping. Of particular importance was key finding # 6 of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) report, which stated that ""Reduced sea ice is very likely to increase marine transport and access to resources"". Indeed, due to this warming trend, the Northwest Passage, the Northern Sea Route and maybe even the Central Arctic Route in the future, are opening up. In the fall of 2008 the first commercial ship transported cargo from the east through the Northwest Passage and in 2009 two German cargo vessels, the MV Beluga Fraternity and the MV Beluga Foresight were the first foreign flag ships to sail the entire Northern Sea Route. This year navigation has really picked up in the Northern Sea Route and therefore 2010 can be viewed as the breakthrough year for trans-Arctic commercial shipping, with more voyages planned for 2011. These new developments are again raising questions concerning the outstanding maritime boundaries in the area, the legal status of the waters concerned, the efficiency of current solutions and the extent of national jurisdiction. As national legal regimes will need to adapt, substantial changes are to be expected to meet these new challenges. Meanwhile, as shipping increases, the stress on the already fragile environment increases with it, which results in great concerns regarding the preservation and protection of the environment. Environmentalists warn about the dangers of vessel-source pollution and emphasize that the lack of infrastructure, information and mandatory legislation, are issues that should urgently be addressed at an international level. This paper will provide insights about recent developments in the Arctic in the abovementioned areas.",,,,,,,"Arctic Council, (2009) Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Report, , http://www.pame.is/images/stories/PDF_Files/AMSA_2009_Report_2nd_print.pdf, 2nd printing, hereinafter 2009 AMSA Report. une of the present authors contributed to this 2009 AMSA Report see ibid., p. 188; Van Der Zwaag, D.L., Chircop, A., (2008) Governance of Arctic Marine Shipping, p. 108. , http://arcticportal.org/uploads/vZ/6u/vZ6uVo9aTTQv45iwl93oFw/AMSA-Shipping-Governance-Final-Report-Revised-November-2008.pdf, Halifax: Marine & Environmental Law Institute; Clark, L., Canada's oversight of Arctic shipping: The need for reform (2008) Tulane Maritime Law Journal, 33 (1), pp. 79-110; Franckx, E., The legal regime of navigation in the Russian arctic (2010) Journal of Transnational Law and Policy, 18 (2), pp. 327-342; United nations convention on the law of the sea (10 December 1982) U.

This is such a moment. Times are hard, and we are called to help revive our economy and sustain our communities while opening our doors even wider to a whole generation of talented youth: The fast-growing population of students who will be the first in their families to go to college, the sons and daughters of newly immigrated families, veterans returning from post-9/11 conflicts, and the students who are now in often under-resourced inner-city and rural schools. We must find ways to welcome them to our ranks. The challenge, as I would frame it, is to engage our students and faculty and staff in creative work that is tuned to the world's most pressing issues as we as institutions become more innovative, effective, and valuable, as we become vital contributors to a newly thriving America. At the same time-to draw on the wise words of our neighbors in Syracuse, the onondaga Nation-we must be ever vigilant for the well-being of the ""seventh generation yet to come."" History shows that higher education can do this. Nearly 150 years ago, between the years in which Baylor and Syracuse were founded, when the Civil War threatened the very existence of our nation, we were challenged to tap the productivity of our land and the promise of the Industrial Age. President Lincoln had the foresight to see beyond the conflict and sign into law the Morrill Act-the landmark legislation creating our land-grant university system to conserve, encourage, and promote agriculture, which employed more than half the nation's population and deeply influenced its prosperity.1 Today, in many respects, we are again in such an era. This time, we are making a transition from an industrial to a knowledge economy. once again, our nation and our world are challenged by conflict and divisions. In our so-called flat, fully wired, and interconnected world-where nearly 70% of Americans live in metropolitan areas- there are thousands who are not connected at all, who are falling further and further behind in education, income, and employment.2 Simultaneously, the aftereffects of industry and overconsumption have given warning that our natural resources are fast becoming depleted. The sustainability of our water, energy, food, and land- resources all absolutely critical for our survival on this planet- unfortunately has also become an issue that has pitted whole groups, cultures, and religions against one another, as if we've forgotten how to raise a barn together! Against this fraught backdrop-and with an eye on that seventh generation yet to come-it is imperative that great institutions roll up their sleeves and get to the world's work. If not, we should rightly be criticized for breaking our social compact, whether we are public or private, religiously affiliated or not. As your new President, Ken Starr, wrote recently in the journal First Things, ""All too often, the modern academy appears as something smugly remote and arrogantly aloof from the people who support and sustain it.""3 We cannot afford, nor should we want, to be tarred with that description. And in very deep ways, it would be inconsistent with the legacies of commitment to public engagement at both of our institutions. In the case of Syracuse, for example, World War II was a defining moment for our institutional identity. overnight, we literally tripled our enrollment to welcome returning veterans on the GI Bill. Today we still proudly embrace our veterans and support their road to opportunity, breaking new ground with our award-winning Entrepreneurs Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities that has expanded to include five other universities, from Connecticut to California. Baylor's touchstone is ensconced in your motto-""Pro Ecclesia"" followed by ""Pro Texana."" Your passionate embrace of faith serves as a motivator for public service, a tradition with roots in your very founding. It is a living legacy, as expressed by the desires of ""nearly one-third of first-year Baylor students to pursue careers in health care,"" as President Starr proudly described in his essay ""The Soul of a College."" Syracuse and Baylor are both private research universities that are acutely aware of their responsibility to serve the public good. A modern research university can and should go beyond its boundaries to tackle the ""messy"" intractable problems that are best addressed through many disciplines with many partners, on campus and off. Education, side by side with research embedded in our rich array of academic disciplines, can make a huge impact in partnerships of all kinds with our many communities. © 2012 by Baylor University Press.
