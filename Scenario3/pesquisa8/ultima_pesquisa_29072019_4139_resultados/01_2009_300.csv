This paper presents a new kind of workshop process aiming at co-creation in a research network. We piloted the process at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland during January - May 2009. The originality of our approach is in combining the methods of foresight and developmental impact evaluation. Furthermore, the process builds up a collaborative network and its research strategy from below, from above and together with customers and collaborators. Our paper describes the pilot process phase by phase and the first results and experiences from the workshops.

However, there are few current implementations in existence, and the majority of those that do exist are bespoke developments which support a restricted number of processes and analyses. This presentation characterizes the wide range of technical challenges which are faced by those delivering on the promise of integrated design solutions. It examines the levels of IT support that can be offered for aspects such as: collaborative work processes; repositories of integrated data; management of information integration; and knowledge management processes. Alongside each of these challenges it identifies current approaches to supporting IDS, both at a commercial level with tools that can be deployed today, and from the viewpoint of researchers working on future improvements to the IDS ideal. The last part of the presentation establishes a technology foresight for the technical development of IDS. Providing a view of the technical future of IDS over the coming decades with projections of the pathways that will lead to adoption of various forms of IDS and the major obstacles where the dearth of solutions will delay the uptake of IDS.","Framework; Interoperability; IT future; Technology review","Collaborative Work; Future technologies; Information integration; Integrated data; Integrated designs; Technical challenges; Technical development; Technology foresight; Buffer storage; Design; Interoperability; Knowledge management; Information technology",,,,,"Eastman, C., Teicholz, P., Sacks, R., Liston, K., (2008) BIM Handbook, , ISBN 978-0-470-18528-5, John Wiley & Sons; (2009), http, International Alliance for Interoperability IAI, Website last accessed May 2009; Amor, R., Jiang, Y. & Chen, X. 2007.

Due to the imperative of corporate social responsibility the car industry can no longer ignore this scapegoat role. This paper identifies two strategic options car manufacturers can espouse to tackle this challenge: (a) anticipating external developments and trends (corporate foresight) and (b) participating in policy making and agenda setting. While the first option aims at increasing economic objectives, i.e. preparing for changing market conditions, the latter can help achieve corporate responsibility objectives if based on principles of sustainable development. Drawing on selected examples of anticipating and participating activities of the automotive industry and their respective opportunities and limits, this paper will explore how these activities, if based on sustainable development principles, can help companies adopt a more favorable role and strengthen the cooperation of the public and private sectors in the quest for sustainable development. © 2009 WIT Press.","Car manufacturers; Corporate foresight; Participation in policy making; Sustainable urban transport","Car industry; Car manufacturers; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; First options; Market condition; Policy making; Public and private sector; Road traffic; Selected examples; Strategic options; Urban transport; Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Decision making; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Environmental protection; automobile industry; manufacturing; market conditions; participatory approach; policy making; private sector; sustainable development; transportation economics; urban transport",,,,,"Müth, M., Verkehrspolitik in Metropolen Südostasiens (2003) Politische Entscheidungsprozesse im Spannungsfeld gesellschaftlicher Interessen: Der Personenverkehr in Singapur und Bangkok, Abera, p. 206. , Hamburg, p; Unsustainable Transport is the title of David Banister's most recent work which summarizes and synthesizes the last decades of the urban transport debate: Banister, David (2005): Unsustainable transport.

Foresight is used on the regional level as a tool for developing common visions about the future, strengthening the cohesion between regional actors and enabling coordinated action towards common goals. Based on broad participation, foresight represents a departure from expert-based scenario building and planning. The emphasis on building common goals and achieving coordinated action makes it feasible to conceptualize foresight processes as instances of governance. Based on a discussion on generalized modes of governance, a contention is made to the effect that foresight processes most closely resemble network governance as a general mode. With this point of departure, the paper uses arguments from the debate on democratic network governance to substantiate the discussion on the democratic aspects of foresight. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",,"democracy; expert system; governance approach; modeling; planning method; regional planning",,,,,"Andersen, J., Pløger, J., The dualism of urban governance in Denmark (2007) European Planning Studies, 15 (10), pp. 1349-1367; Asheim, B.T., Learning and innovation in a globalising economy: The role of learning regions (2007) Learning Together for Local Innovation: Promoting Learning Regions, pp. 218-234. , B.

In current design curricula, there is little distinction between different types of design problems, yet foresight engineering design teams often struggle with their broad, sometimes under-defined, design problems. Based on a case study from Stanford University's well-documented graduate design course, ME310, we discovered three insights that can be applied to other foresight engineering projects. The first is to use the ambiguity of the design space as an impetus for innovation; the second is to ensure that a chosen project concept complies with tacit limitations within the design field; and the third is to use parallel prototyping.","Ambiguity; Design education; Foresight engineering; ME310; Project-based learning","Ambiguity; Design course; Design curricula; Design education; Design problems; Design spaces; Engineering design; Engineering design projects; Engineering project; ME310; Project based learning; Stanford University; Design; Curricula",,,,,"Buchanan, R., Wicked problems in design thinking (1992) Design Issues, 8 (2), pp. 5-21; Dym, C.L., Agogino, A.M., Eris, O., Frey, D.D., Leifer, L.J., Engineering design thinking, teaching, and learning (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 103-120. , Jan; Van Dusen, J., Project engineer hathaway dinwiddie construction company (2008) Personal Interview and Site Visit, , 10 Nov; Kunz, J., (2008) Professor Center for Integrated Facilities Engineering, , Stanford University Personal Interview. 6 Nov; Brown, N., Autodesk, building information management (2008) Phone Interview: Regarding the Use of Building Information Management Software in the Construction Industry, , 14 Nov; Michael, B., (2009) Consulting Professor in Mechanical Engineering Design, , Stanford University Lecture on Cross Cultural Design Process. 23 March; Cockayne, W., (2009) Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering, , Stanford University.

Wood industry is more, than it usually is the case, concerned by that issue due to the fact that it uses natural raw material; hence there are constraints of the process of steady improvement of products and technologies and introducing radical changes to them. At the same time, this industry is of special importance for sustainable development of the Polish economy, for it is a production sector strongly determined by nature (production capability of forests) and offering ecological products. In that context it is important to know which lines of long-term development of wood science and industry are expected and desired by society. It is possible to gain that knowledge thanks to the research project entitled ""Foresight in the wood science and industry - research development scenarios in Poland till 2020"" carried out in the Wood Technology Institute in Poznan.

In the proposed method, as a main part of the simulator-based foresight control system, a simulator of an exact plant model of non-affine nonlinear plant is first constructed. If relative degree of disturbance is smaller than control input, servo type filter will be then installed in series of disturbance line in order to adjust relative degree. Next, a control target equation which defines pole assignment for stable output error convergence is determined. Based on this control target equation, the control input for non-affine type nonlinear plant is generated. In this paper, the control of a boiler was implemented by use of the proposed method. The simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2009 SICE.","Control target equation; Nonlinear plant; Servo type filter; Simulator-based foresight control; System identification","Control approach; Control inputs; Control target; Nonlinear plant; Output errors; Plant model; Pole assignment; Relative degrees; Servo type filter; Simulation result; System identifications; Identification (control systems); Nonlinear equations; Simulators; Targets; Boiler control",,,,,"Baruch, I., Albino, J.M.F., Garrido, R., Gortcheva, E., An indirect adaptive neural control of nonlinear plants (2000) Proceedings of Int.

The continued use of physical prototyping is based on its strength in helping teams to make ideas tangible, iterate quickly at a low cost, and develop a shared language. Over the past seven years, our team has used prototyping in an industry-research program focused on foresight engineering-the development of new products and services that are three or more product cycles in the future. Through the discussion of three international cases drawn from India, Europe and the United States, this paper offers insight into the value and application of physical prototypes earlier in the innovation process and before the traditional handoff from strategy to product design. In summary, physical prototypes are exemplary tools for envisioning complex systems, serving an unmet need in helping teams explore potential service applications, and helping reveal the path of progression from today's solutions to tomorrow's opportunities.","Foresight engineering; Innovation; Prototyping; Service development; System design","Continued use; Design practice; Innovation process; Low costs; New product; Physical prototyping; Product cycle; Service applications; Service development; Shared language; Product design; Software prototyping; Systems analysis; Innovation",,,,,"Carleton, T., Communicating technology visions (2009) Funktioneering, 1 (1), p. 13; Carleton, T., Prototyping in three-dimensions: Rough mockups in practice Design Studies, , submission; Cockayne, W., Becoming a foresight thinker (2009) Funktioneering, 1 (1), p. 12; Cutkosky, M., Developments in (global) project-based design education (2000) Workshop on Global Project-Based Learning, , presentation to the.

Risk assessment of such interdependent systems is challenging; the identification of the interdependencies as well as the identification of potential consequences in case of disturbances is demanding. The existing knowledge of the dependencies and interdependencies and related potential risk of cascading effects is still insufficient to provide immediate solutions. Therefore, novel proactive, systematic tools for risks assessment are needed. In order to investigate what the novel risk factors of CIs and their implications are, foresight and scenario methods as a tool for analysing risks and interdependencies of CIs are studied.

A key feature of the model is that individuals differ in their ability to accumulate human capital, which is the main source of wage inequality in this model. We examine the response of this model to skill-biased technical change (SBTC), which is modeled as an increase in the trend growth rate of the price of human capital starting in the early 1970s. The model displays behavior that is consistent with several important trends observed in the US data, including the rise in overall wage inequality; the fall and subsequent rise in the college premium, as well as the fact that this behavior was most pronounced for younger workers; the rise in within-group inequality; the stagnation in median wage growth; and the small rise in consumption inequality despite the large rise in wage inequality. We consider different scenarios regarding how individuals' expectations evolve during SBTC. Specifically, we study the case where individuals immediately realize the advent of SBTC (perfect foresight), and the case where they initially underestimate the future growth of the price of human capital (pessimistic priors), but learn the truth in a Bayesian fashion over time. Lack of perfect foresight appears to have little effect on the main results of the paper. Overall, the model shows promise for explaining a diverse set of wage distribution trends observed since the 1970s in a unifying human capital framework.",,,,,,,"Abowd John, M., Card, D., On the covariance structure of earnings and hours changes (1989) Econometrica, 57 (2), pp. 411-445; Daron, A., Why do new technologies complement skills?

Germany further developed this principle in the 1970s as a foundation for its environmental law and policies on global warming and acid rain. Embracing the principle has also led to a strong and innovative environmental industry in Germany. The European Union has continued to advance a precautionary approach through its new legislation on chemicals, i.e. Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), first introduced as a proposal in 2003 and finally adopted in 2006. The precautionary principle often functions as a statement of values, to be used as a guideline in the decision-making process.

Without action this will have a cost of around £49.9 billion per year. To address this increasing problem, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde developed a steering group that included acute, community and local authority services - leading to the launch of the Glasgow and Clyde weight management service in 2004.

The evaluation index system provides an objective reference for the selection, check-up and training of CEOs, and its validity is verified via empirical example.","CEO; GIOWA operator; Leadership evaluation; Strategic leadership","Evaluation index system; Ordered weighted averaging; Strategic leadership; Triangular fuzzy numbers; Public relations; Fuzzy sets",,,,,"Nahavandi, A., (2003) The Art and Science of Leadership, pp. 103-104. , Beijing: China Machine Press; Leadership, F.E.A., (1969) The Handbook of Social Psychology, pp. 205-282. , 2nd ed.

We propose a third alternative for inter-firm contract governance. The social network capital offers a measure of reputation that can indicate to future trading partners the reduced likelihood of opportunistic behavior. The network of trading partners enables a community enforcement of contracting terms by providing safeguards that may not be offered by traditional measures. Based on a large dataset of public ITO announcements we examine the role that structural embeddedness can play in predicting contract duration. We find preliminary evidence suggesting that network position does matter in predicting contract structure over and above the traditional economic variables.","IT outsourcing; Network-level effects; Node-level; Reputation; Social network","IT outsourcing; Network-level effects; Node-level; Reputation; Social Networks; Commerce; Information systems; Social networking (online); Outsourcing",,,,,"Anselin, L., (1988) Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, , Springer; Baker, G., Gibbons, R., Murphy, K.J., Relational Contracts and the Theory of the Firm (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (1), pp. 39-84. , Feb; Banerjee, A.V., Duflo, E., Reputation Effects and the Limits of Contracting: A Study of the Indian Software Industry (2000) The Quarterly Journal of Economics (August), pp. 989-1017; Beckman, C.M., Haunschild, P.R., Phillips, D.J., Friends or Strangers?

As elsewhere in the world, ICTs have affected how Singapore functions as a nation and lives as a society but the approach and impact of government planning and implementation of ICT strategies are of exceptional quality even by world standards. Looking back, one can see that much of the hard work of laying the foundation of creating a digital Singapore was done during and by the Goh Chok Tong administration and much credit should be given to it. However, it is not a story of flawless foresight and planning or unqualified success. There were misconceptions, miscalculations, and misapplications.

Furthermore, practical knowledge from other pre-service teachers who were receiving on-site training at schools served as foresight to pre-service teachers who were yet in earlier stages of preparation, and served as useful information for members training simultaneously but in different locations.","Learning community; Pre-service teacher training; Reflection; Social networking service; Social support","Learning community; On-site training; Pre-service teacher; Pre-service teacher training; Social networking service; Social support; Reflection; Social networking (online); Personnel training",,,,,"Ohnogi, H., Miyakawa, J., Structures and changes in perceptions of student teachers' anxiety towards practice teaching (1996) Japanese Journal of Educational Psychology, 44, pp. 454-462. , (in Japanese); Imae, K., Shimizu, H., The effects of the teaching practicum on becoming a teacher (1994) Japan Journal of Educational Technology, 17 (4), pp. 185-195. , (in Japanese); Hisata, M., The current trends and future issues of social support research (1987) Nursing Research, 20 (2), pp. 170-179. , (in Japanese); Boberg, E., Gustafson, D.H., Hawkins, R.P., Peressini, T., Chan, C., Brickev, E., Development, acceptance and use patterns of a computer-based education and social support system for people living with AIDS/HIV infection (1995) Computers in Human Behavior, 11, pp. 289-311; Cummings, J., Sproull, L., Kiesler, S., Beyond hearing: Where real world and online support meet (2002) Group Dynamics, 6, pp. 78-88; Festinger, L., A theory of social comparison processes (1954) Human Relations, 7, pp. 117-140; Wenger, E., (1998) Community of Practice - Learning, Meaning, and Identity, , Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press","Mochizuki, T.; School of Network and Information, Senshu UniversityJapan",,"The Hong Kong Institute of Education;Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education (APSCE);Microsoft;Center for Learning, Teaching and Technology (LTT)",,"17th International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2009","30 November 2009 through 4 December 2009","Hong Kong",88498,,9789868473539,,,"English","Proc.

As such they can enable firms to access new markets or threaten them with an array of new competitors and a lack of knowledge. This makes an early identification of convergence trends highly important. In the present paper we focus on the application of a frequency-based analysis and visualization software (STN AnaVist) for the forecasting of converging industries. Scrutinizing 3,836 patent and scientific publication references on phytosterols in the areas of nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals, we employ research landscape, co-authorship and International Patent Classification (IPC) co-classification analyses. The results demonstrate partial convergence between the pharmaceutical, the chemical, the nutrition and the cosmetics industries and the suitability of the employed approach. According to this study, scientific as well as technology convergence have taken place in this segment, with a time-lag of roughly 25 years. © 2009 Imperial College Press.","Co-authorship; Converging industries; Cosmeceuticals; Nutraceuticals and functional foods; Patent analysis; Phytosterols; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Adams, J.D., Fundamental stocks of knowledge and productivity growth (1990) The Journal of Political Economy, 98, pp. 673-702; Bainbridge, W.S., Transformative concepts in scientific convergence (2006) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1093, pp. 24-45; Bierly, P.E., Chakrabarti, A.K., Managing through industry fusion (1999) The Dynamics of Innovation: Strategic and Managerial Implications, pp. 223-228. , K Brockhoff, et al.

However, the deployment of firm-specific knowledge often requires key employees to make specialized human capital investments that are not easily redeployable to other settings. Thus, in the absence of effective safeguards and trust building devices, employees with foresight may be reluctant to make such specialized investments. This study explores both economic- and relationship-based governance mechanisms that might mitigate this underinvestment problem. Effective use of these governance mechanisms enables a firm to obtain greater performance from its efforts to deploy firm-specific knowledge resources. Empirical results further support these key arguments. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Employee governance mechanisms; Employee human capital; Firm-specific knowledge resources; Resource-based view of the firm","Competitive advantage; Empirical results; Employee governance mechanisms; Employee human capital; Firm-specific knowledge resources; Firm-specific resources; Human capital investments; Knowledge resource; Resource-based view of the firm; Specific knowledge; Sustainable Competitive Advantages; Trust building; Competition; Investments; Personnel",,,,,"Alchian, A.A., Demsetz, H., Production, information costs, and economic organization (1972) American Economic Review, 62, pp. 777-795; Amit, R., Schoemaker, P.J.H., Strategic assets and organizational rent (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (1), pp. 33-46; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barney, J.B., Is the resource-based 'view' a useful perspective for strategic management research?

The concept of efficiency expresses a specific form of rationality, used in attempts to control a changing situation by bringing it into conformity with a vision of how the world works. Efficiency became an important technological value during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as part of the construction of modern industrial society. It was integral in achieving the purposeful and measurable effects in an industrial modernity that championed rationality, foresight, and planning in the control and manipulation of the social and material worlds, and it remains an important post-industrial value, particularly in continuing concern about waste and wise resource management. Efficiency may be used in two different ways, as a general term, usually of approval, indicating a job well and economically done; and as a specific technical assessment, growing out of the experience of industrialization and tied to measurements of performance in machines and the thermodynamics of energy. Efficiency in general use may be quantified; in engineering traditions, it is quantified, almost without exception. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The main goal is to capture the physics of the gear mechanism well close to the actual machine as well take the engineering insight of the bearing behaviour and performance through a multiphysics simulation. In designing, beyond the reliability, the bearings performance is one of the most foresights of the compressor mechanism design. Thus, the bearings were simulated as hydrodynamic joints (Elastohydrodynamic). Here the crankshaft, the con rod and the crankcase are considered as flexible elastic bodies and modelled by a FEM. It has been noticed the flexibility of the bodies has a huge influence in the mechanical performance concerning power losses, minimum oil film thickness and so one. The capability of using flexible bodies when designing a reciprocating compressor mechanism has shown an improved approach concerning reliability and performance. © Embraco, 2009.",,"Dynamic behaviours; Elastic body; Flexible bodies; Gear mechanisms; Mechanical performance; Mechanism design; Minimum oil film thickness; Multiphysics simulations; Power-losses; Reciprocating compressor; Bearings (structural); Crankshafts; Elasticity; Elastohydrodynamics; Machine design; Compressors",,,,,"Bearing analysis of a reciprocate compressor using elastohydrodynamic joints and flexible bodies Proceedings of IMECE2008 2008 ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, p. 2008. , Bosco, October 31-November 6, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; AVL-EXCITE Manual (Version 7.0), AVL LIST GmbH, Graz, 2007; Bosco, R., Weber, G., Challenges on the development of a CO2 compressor focusing on structural strength and reliability (2008) 8th IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Working Fluids, , Copenhagen","Bosco Jr., R.; Embraco, Whirlpool SABrazil",,"PTG Holroyd;PTG Precision Components;PTG Precision Technologies Group;IOR;British Compressed Air Society Limited",,"International Conference on Compressors and their Systems","7 September 2009 through 9 September 2009","London",80286,,9781843345817,,,"English","Inst.

Floods are the primary hazard affecting Malaysia, ranking in the top deciles for most of the western half of the country. Landslides and droughts are also significant though their effects are limited to much smaller areas in the eastern regions. When weighted by mortality, landslides pose a large risk for the northeastern part of the country. Deforestation due to uncontained development of hill slope areas is partly the cause of a majority of landslides in Malaysia. Over the past four decades, Malaysia has sustained more than USD 100 million in total estimated damages due to floods and landslides. Health emergency and disaster preparedness includes getting ready (readiness), anticipating consequences or impacts from hazards or emergencies (foresight), planning for a variety of scenarios (anticipatory planning), and taking the necessary measures in order to avoid or reduce risk (precautionary action).

The outcome of financial reporting represents useful information for decision making. Meanwhile the mechanisms of the capital markets determine reactions on behalf of accounting regulatory bodies who take action through standard setting. It is these standards that will have a big influence on the aforementioned outcome of financial reporting. Beside, there are other influential factors such as accounting practices, the accounting profession, national history, culture, and economy acting at different levels. It was this reasoning that motivated this research demarche of achieving a complete diagnosis of two emergent capital markets, shaped into a SWOT analysis for financial instruments' reporting and the current financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach - A special emphasize is put on analyzing formal harmonization on issues related to financial instruments by performing an empirical study. Moreover, the analysis is completed by a descriptive approach of the influential factors such as economic, cultural, and political background of the two nations. The paper also comparatively positions the foresights of the national, European, and international referential. Statistical indicators help quantifying the similarity and dissimilarity degree. Findings - In times of financial crisis, when everybody is trying to point his finger on somebody else, an empirical analysis of national accounting regulations proving a high level of formal harmonization with and among the international referential and European directives proves an interesting point. The results make us think twice before designating a scapegoat. Research limitations/implications - The paper only creates the framework proving that individual experiences should be put into good use especially in an area that is continuously exposed to financial engineering. Further developments completing the study focusing on accounting regulations with accounting practices should indicate more precise actions to be taken. Practical implications - Findings show a significant similarity level between the two national accounting standards, and most importantly between the international referential and the European accounting regulations, and should determine us to furthermore rationally approach the accounting regulation process instead of impulsive reacting to the current financial crisis. Original aspects - The originality of the paper consists in offering insights on the specific case of Romania and Czech Republic, correlating the state of facts with the foresights of national accounting regulations, by reference to the international referential and the current financial crisis. © 2009 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,,,,,"Aisbitt, S., Measurement of harmony of financial reporting within and between countries: The case of the Nordic Countries (2001) European Accounting Review, 10 (1), pp. 22-51; Alexander, D., Nobes, C., (2004) Financial Accounting.

Correspondingly, the demand for technologies to enhance animal performance through natural and organic solutions continues to increase. One such technology receiving considerable attention is the feedstuff application of live, beneficial bacteria, commonly called probiotics, but properly referred to as direct-fed microbials (DFM). The use of DFM in animal agriculture has grown continually over the last decade, yet the commercial success of DFM in poultry production to date has been limited. Overviewed here are the history, commercial applications, and research trials of DFM technology in animal agriculture as a means to gain some foresight into the future commercial use of DFM in poultry. We discuss successful probiotic trials in animal agriculture and emphasize those in poultry production that demonstrate 1) improved BW gain, 2) decreased morbidity, 3) decreased incidence of bird and human pathogens, and 4) increased economic profitability. Last, we present current and future obstacles and basic microbiological concepts that are essential for functional probiotic technologies. © 2009 Poultry Science Association, Inc.","Antibiotic alternative; Direct fed microbial; Natural; Organic; Poultry; Probiotic","Animalia; Aves; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,,,,"Casewell, M., Friis, C., Marco, E., McMullin, P., Phillips, I., The European ban on growth-promoting antibiotics and emerging consequences for human and animal health (2003) J.

The study was carried out as a case study, and Anthropological Theory of Didactic was used as theoretical framework. The study was carried out in the 2007-2008 academic year, with 33 primary and secondary postgraduate students who were studying at Karadeniz Technical University, Institute of Science. Data were collected with a questionnaire, including open-ended questions, and interviews with eight volunteer students. Data showed that the participating students personal relations originated in the framework of four fundamental themes; acceptances, foresights, expectations and factors. It was also determined that students faced some problems resulted from external and personal factors. It is expected that the findings of this study would shed light on criteria on how prospective postgraduates need to select courses. This study also makes a contribution to the understanding of the close relationship between the courses and research phase. It is also believed that this study will be a ground for further studies in the area.","Course election approaches; Courses in post-graduate education; Post-graduate education; Post-graduate students",,,,,,"Chevallard, Y., (1992) Fundemantal concepts in didactics: perspectives provided by an anthropological approach, Recherches en Didactique des Mathematiques, pp. 131-167. , Selected Papers, Grenoble: La Pense Sauvage; Cohen, L., Manion, L., (1994) Research Methods in Education, , Fourth Edition, Routledge, London; Cikrikci-Demirtasli, N., Lisansüstü Eǧitim Programlarina Girişte Lisansüstü Eǧitimi Giriş Sinavi (Les) Sonucunun ve Diǧer Ölçütlerin Kullanimina İlişkin Bir Tarama (2002) Ankara Üniversitesi Eǧitim Bilimleri Fakültesi Dergisi, 35, pp. 1-2; İçli, G., Eǧitim İstihdam ve Teknoloji (2001) Pamukkale Üniversitesi Eǧitim Fakültesi Dergisi, 9, pp. 65-71; Kaya, S., Sezgin, G., Kavcar, N., Lisansüstü Eǧitim Sorunlarinin Öǧrenci ve Öǧretim Üyesi Açisindan Deǧerlendirilmesi (2005) Buca Eǧitim Fakültesi Dergisi, 17. , (Özel Sayi); Kurnaz, M.A., (2007) Üniversite 1. sinif seviyesinde enerji kavraminin öǧrenim durumlarinin analizi., , Yayinlanmamiş Yüksek Lisans Tezi, KTÜ, Trabzon; Kurnaz, M.A., Saǧlam Arslan, A., Using the Anthropological Theory of Didactics in Physics: Characterization of the Teaching Conditions of Energy Concept and the Personal Relations of freshmen to this Concept (2009) Journal of Turkish Science Education, 6 (1), pp. 72-88; Lisansüstü Öǧretim Yönetmenliǧi, Resmi Gazete, Sayi:17830, 6.10.1982; Merriam, S.B., (1998) Qualitative Research and Case Study Applications in Education, , (2nd Ed.)

This paper focuses on the previously neglected relationship between personal debt and mental health. Aims: Using the UK as a case study, this paper considers the public health challenges presented by debt to mental health. We then propose solutions identified in workshops held during the UK Government's Foresight Review of Mental Capital and Wellbeing. Results: Within their respective sectors, health professionals should receive basic 'debt first aid' training, whilst all UK financial sector codes of practice should - as a minimum - recognise the existence of customers with mental health problems. Further longitudinal research is also needed to 'unpack' the relationship between debt and mental health.Across sectors, a lack of co-ordinated activity across health, money advice, and creditor organisations remains a weakness. A renewed emphasis on co-ordinated 'debt care pathways' and better communication between local health and advice services is needed. Discussion: The relationship between debt and mental health presents a contemporary public health challenge. Solutions exist, but will require action and investment at a time of competition for funds. © 2009 Radcliffe Publishing.","Debt; Mental health; Recession","adult; article; economics; finance; health service; human; major clinical study; mental disease; mental health; mental health care; money; patient counseling; primary medical care; United Kingdom; work",,,,,"Round Table: Reducing the psychosocial impact of the financial and economic crisis, , www.ec.europa.eu/health/ph-determinants/life-style/mental/ev-20090427-en.htm, 27 April 2009, accessed 14 August 2009; Dorling, D., Unemployment and health (2009) BMJ, 338, p. 1091; Stuckler, D., Meissner, C.M., King, L.P., Can a bank crisis break your heart?

Two construction types were represented in the project, masonry cavity and light steel frame. Phase 1 of the project sought to assess in detail the design, construction and air permeability of 25 dwellings that were constructed to conform to the requirements of Approved Document Part L1 2002. While the total number of dwellings reported here is small, the results suggest that there is not a consistent approach to the way in which developers present information on air leakage to those on site, a mixture of approaches are utilised on site to achieve the same specification and there appears to be a lack of foresight in the detailed design stage, resulting in specifications that are practically very difficult to achieve. Despite this, the air permeability results suggest that dwellings constructed with a wet/mechanically plastered internal finish, can default to a reasonable standard of airtightness by UK standards, without much additional attention being given to airtightness.","Air leakage; Airtightness; Housing; Pressurisation testing","Air leakage; Airtightness; Design and construction; Detailed design; Key message; Light steel frames; Masonry cavities; Participatory action research; Phase 1; Air permeability; Apartment houses; Housing; Project management; Research; Specifications; Buildings",,,,,"Borland, S., Bell, M., (2003) Airtightness of Buildings - Towards Higher Performance, , A Project Proposal to ODPM Building Regulations Division Under the Building Operational Performance Framework.

We propose a third alternative in addition to dyadic measures of inter-firm reputation. The reputation of an actor may be associated with how the firm is positioned in a network, which in turn influences how information about a particular actor flows within the network. Such aspects of structural embeddedness suggest a role in predicting characteristics of inter-firm exchange. The network capital offers a measure to mitigate the uncertainty associated the nature of service outsourced and the service provider. The network of trading partners enables a community enforcement of contracting terms by providing safeguards that may not be offered by traditional measures of formal or relational governance. Based on a large dataset of publicly announced ITO arrangements, we examine the role that structural embeddedness can play in predicting contract duration. Our preliminary results are very encouraging. We find evidence suggesting that network position does matter in predicting contract structure over and above the traditional economic variables.","Contract governance; IT outsourcing; Reputation; Social network","Data sets; Economic variables; Embeddedness; Information technology outsourcing; IT outsourcing; Reputation; Service provider; Social Networks; Trading partners; Forecasting; Industry; Information systems; Public policy; Social sciences computing; Outsourcing",,,,,"Baker, G., Gibbons, R., Murphy, K.J., Relational contracts and the theory of the firm (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (1), pp. 39-84. , Feb; Banerjee, A.V., Duflo, E., Reputation effects and the limits of contracting: A study of the indian software industry (2000) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, , Aug; Banker, R.D., Slaughter, S.A., The moderating effects of structure on volatility and complexity in software enhancement (2000) Information Systems Research, 11 (3), pp. 219-240; Bannerjee, Duflo, Reputation effects and the limits of contracting: A study of the indian software industry (2000) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, , Aug; Beckman, C.M., Haunschild, P.R., Phillips, D.J., Friends or strangers?

For example, Castel, McCabe, and Roediger (2007) recently demonstrated an illusion of competence for identical word pairs (mouse-mouse). In two experiments, the authors examined possible sources for this overconfidence, including phonetic, semantic, and orthographic similarity. An illusion of competence was found for homophones, synonyms, orthographically similar, and unrelated items, whereas no illusion of competence was found for word pairs with a relatively high forward-semantic association. Self-paced study times indicated that encoding fluency was not closely associated with the magnitude of overconfidence. Error data revealed participants may have been engaging in strategic responding in order to maximise correct recall. Our results underscore the importance of considering factors that influence both JOLs and recall performance when considering sources of (mis)calibration in absolute accuracy. © 2009 Canadian Psychological Association.","Cued-recall; Judgments of learning; Metacognition","article; association; decision making; human; illusion; linguistics; mental capacity; methodology; neuropsychological test; paired associate learning; phonetics; photostimulation; physiology; reaction time; recall; semantics; Cues; Humans; Illusions; Judgment; Mental Competency; Mental Recall; Neuropsychological Tests; Paired-Associate Learning; Phonetics; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Semantics; Vocabulary",,,,,"Begg, I., Duft, S., Lalonde, P., Melnick, R., Sanvito, J., Memory predictions are based on ease of processing (1989) Journal of Memory and Language, 28, pp. 610-632; Benjamin, A.S., Bjork, R.A., Hirshman, E., Predicting the future and reconstructing the past: A Bayesian characterization of the utility of subjective fluency (1998) Acta Psychologica, 98, pp. 267-290; Carroll, M., Nelson, T.O., Kirwan, A., Tradeoff of semantic relatedness and degree of overlearning: Differential effects on metamemory and on long-term retention (1997) Acta Psychologica, 95 (3), pp. 239-253. , PII S0001691896000406; Castel, A.D., McCabe, D.P., Roediger, H.L., Illusions of competence and overestimation of associative memory for identical items: Evidence from judgments of learning (2007) Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 14, pp. 107-111; Connor, L.T., Dunlosky, J., Hertzog, C., Age-related differences in absolute but not relative metamemory accuracy (1997) Psychology and Aging, 12 (1), pp. 50-71. , DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.12.1.50; Dunlosky, J., Matvey, G., Empirical analysis of the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction of judgments of learning (JOLs): Effects of relatedness and serial position on JOLs (2001) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition, 27 (5), pp. 1180-1191. , DOI 10.1037//0278-7393.27.5.1180; Hertzog, C., Dunlosky, J., Robinson, A.E., Kidder, D.P., Encoding fluency is a cue used for judgments about learning (2003) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition, 29 (1), pp. 22-34. , DOI 10.1037//0278-7393.29.1.22; Higham, P.A., Tarn, H., Generation failure: Estimating metacognition in cued recall (2005) Journal of Memory & Language, 52, pp. 595-617; Higham, P.A., Tarn, H., Release from generation failure: The role of study list structure (2006) Memory & Cognition, 34, pp. 148-157; Koriat, A., Monitoring one's own knowledge during study: A cue-utilization approach to judgments of learning (1997) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 126 (4), pp. 349-370. , DOI 10.1037//0096-3445.126.4.349; Koriat, A., Bjork, R.A., Illusions of competence in monitoring one's knowledge during study (2005) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition, 31 (2), pp. 187-194. , DOI 10.1037/0278-7393.31.2.187; Koriat, A., Bjork, R.A., Illusions of competence during study can be remedied by manipulations that enhance learners' sensitivity to retrieval conditions at test (2006) Memory and Cognition, 34 (5), pp. 959-972; Koriat, A., Bjork, R.A., Mending metacognitive illusions: A comparison of mnemonic-based and theory-based procedures (2006) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition, 32 (5), pp. 1133-1145. , DOI 10.1037/0278-7393.32.5.1133; Koriat, A., Ma'Ayan, H., The effects of encoding fluency and retrieval fluency on judgments of learning (2005) Journal of Memory and Language, 52, pp. 478-492; Koriat, A., Sheffer, L., Ma'Ayan, H., Comparing objective and subjective learning curves: Judgments of learning exhibit increased underconfidence with practice (2002) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 131, pp. 147-162; Nelson, D.L., McEvoy, C.L., Schreiber, T.A., The University of South Florida free association, rhyme, and word fragment norms (2004) Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers, 36, pp. 402-407; Nelson, T.O., Narens, L., Metamemory: A theoretical framework and new findings (1990) The Psychology of Learning and Motivation: Advances in Research and Theory, 26. , G.

Within the first year the newly formed group grew in membership to several hundred, sponsored technical sessions at the National Electronic Conference, Acoustical Society Symposium, and IRE National Convention, and had published the first issue of the Transactions. The IRE Group chose as its focus, ultrasonic measurements, communications, and processing, with emphasis on applications, devices, techniques, and associated circuitry. In 1985 we became the IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control (UFFC) Society to reflect the expanded interests of the membership. The UFFC Society sponsors three annual Symposia; the International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS), the International Symposium on the Application of Ferroelectrics (ISAF) and the International Frequency Control Symposium (IFCS). In the past 56 years our Society has grown and flourished as a top technical IEEE society through its symposia, publications, member sponsorship and awards, and its cooperative activities with other technical societies. We presently have 2000 members in 68 countries.

In particular, land use and land management change affect the hydrology that determines flood hazard, water resources (for human and environmental needs) and the transport and dilution of pollutants. It is increasingly recognised that the management of land and water are inextricably linked (e.g. Defra, 2004). ""Historical context, state of the science and current management issues"" section of this paper addresses the science underlying those linkages, for both rural and urban areas. In ""Historical context, state of the science and current management issues"" section we discuss future drivers for change and their management implications. Detailed analyses are available for flood risk, from the Foresight Future Flooding project (Evans et al., 2004a,b) and other recent studies, and so we use flooding as an exemplar, with a more limited treatment of water resource and water quality aspects. Finally in ""Science needs and developments"" section we discuss science needs and likely progress.

The term Technology Augmented Health (TAH) is introduced. TAH is incorporating the ""citizen as co-producer"" in health and in care related activities by augmenting the context and societal cross-sectional knowledge-share between the citizen(s) and the professionals, e.g. concerning health, in healthcare, environmental, food, and welfare functions. In an extended time-frame TAH should provide the citizen with knowledge and response ability in relation to exogenous (e.g. lifestyle, food, environment, family and work conditions) and endogenous (e.g. disease, physiology, genetics) factors of life.

In France, the 2000 law of Urban Reform and Solidarity (""Solidarité et Renouvellement Urbain"") provides a legal framework to land use decentralization. It requires the planning design process to be participative and to involve civil society through consultation phases. It also addresses the issue of coherence among legal planning documents along the scale hierarchy, the larger scale plan conditioning the others. In the Reunion Island, the multi-level institutional system includes a region, its four micro-regions and 26 districts; each having their own land use plan. The revision of the regional plan (""Schéma d'Aménagement Régional"", SAR) was the opportunity to revisit the various plans to make them more coherent across scales. This paper presents how research was included in this political process. The SAR revision was initially thought as a one-scale regular participatory foresight process in three stages, i.e. (1) a land use assessment (diagnostic); (2) the definition and discussion of contrasted scenarios; (3) the development of the final land use plan. The overall consultation process involved a large group of participants, including members of various institutions and of the civil society. They defined the logic of four contrasted land use scenarios, and sorted key challenges for the future of the Reunion Island. Stage 2 was however handled in an innovative way due to the collaboration with a research project called DOMINO-Reunion. The DOMINO-Reunion Project put together a team of researchers from various disciplinary backgrounds, and members of extension and support services for rural and agricultural development involved in the various debate on land use at each scale. Together, the team followed a companion modelling approach to develop a prototype of a dynamic model meant to assist the main players in building various land use scenarios and simulating their mid- to long-term consequences on urban, agricultural and natural stakes. A subset of participants of both processes, the SAR revision and DOMINO-Reunion, collaborated to adapt the model prototype to the SAR scenarios and feed the regional land use debate. This paper analyses how our companion modelling approach in two steps has helped integrating multi-scale stakes in the SAR revision process. It discusses specific challenges for participatory modelling, which are linked to power balance such as stakeholder's exclusion, over representation of specific interests and political co-optation, focussing on two specific processes: &βυλλ; the integration of multi-scale negotiation processes and indicators in the evolving model; &βυλλ; the implication of stakeholders, which are involved in various land use decision-making arena, in the participatory modelling of the system. We showed that companion modelling helped increase the representation and the weight of agricultural issues in the debate, although urban considerations still prevailed in the regional arena. The paper concludes on the benefits and drawback of integrating progressively different decision-marking scales in a participatory process.","Decision support system; Land use governance; Modelling; Multi-scale; Participatory approach","Agricultural development; Civil society; Consultation process; Design process; In-buildings; Land-use plan; Land-use scenario; Large groups; Legal frameworks; Microregions; Modelling; Multi-level; Multiscales; Negotiation process; Participatory approach; Participatory process; Political process; Power balance; Regional plans; Support services; Three stages; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Land use; Landforms; Laws and legislation; Regional planning; Research; Mathematical models",,,,,"Agrawal, A., Ribot, J., Accountability in decentralization: A framework with South Asian and West African cases (1999) Journal of Developing Areas, 33 (4), pp. 473-502; Botta, A., David, D., Manglou, S., Clavaud, N., Payet, D., (2007) Modèle DOMINO-SMAT: Guide Utilisateur, p. 41; Barreteau, O., Antona, M., D'Aquino, P., Aubert, S., Boissau, S., Bousquet, F., Daré, W., Weber, J., Our companion modelling approach (2003) Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 6 (2). , http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/6/2/1.html; Bousquet, F., Barreteau, O., D'Aquino, P., Etienne, M., Boissau, S., Aubert, S., Le Page, C., Castella, J.-C., Multi-agent systems and role games: Collective learning processes for ecosystem management (2002) Complexity and Ecosystem Management: The Theory and Practice of Multi-agent Approaches, pp. 248-285. , M.

The plant analysed was built formerly as an incineration plant and was recently refurbished with a heat recovery steam generator to drive a condensing steam turbine. In the foresight of an enlargement of the plant capacity, the Technical Office of the Company asked the Energetica Department of University of Pisa for an analysis of the recovery capability. The Technical Office and the Energetica Department decided to create a lumped parameter model in order to simulate the temperature behavior of the combustion products. This model was created inside Matlab/Simulink environment. The followed procedure led to the reproduction of the system interested by the cycle in steady state conditions in order to obtain a model simple enough but at the same time rigorous of the real behavior of steam cicle. After the description of the plant modeling, model calibration and validation is shown, by means of the comparison between the measured and simulated values of temperatures and mass flows in several load conditions. The model developed is currently used by the Technical Office of the Company for further developments of the plant.

After briefly introducing some of the challenges characterizing the building of an ""ICT-enabled Knowledge-Society"", and the implications of ICTs for development, the paper discusses potential and limits of e-Government vs. e-Governance. In defining the organizational and institutional dimension underpinning ICT-enabled Governance models, the paper positions e-Government activities within the broader framework of e-Governance (i.e., the governance with and of ICT), as a learning type of dynamics. e-governance involves at the same time a constrained and open relationship with local and global actors and the redefinition of the interaction between freedom and dependencies. Furthermore, the paper presents an overview of selected mega-trends in the area of ICTs and their policy implications for Governments, with a special focus on the case of the European Union. In doing so, the paper introduces some key policy issues around the governance ""with and of ICTs"", exploring future perspectives towards building an ICT-enabled Knowledge-Society. In this regard, it is important to outline a key question around which the paper is built: what kind of changes will take place in society in the next 10 - 20 years? And what will be the role of ICTs and emerging technologies in particular, in government operations? The paper concludes identifying clues of the potential benefits, as well as the risks and barriers connected to ICT-enabled governance, and the expected impacts on society in view of further research.

Some of these active safety systems are based on environment recognition to detect critical situations or imminent crashes. These systems give warnings to the driver and can provide assistance (e.g. by setting the proper brake power). One key requirement for such systems is robust and reliable knowledge of the car environment. Today, the underlying environment recognition very often uses the data of single sensors. Due to increasing requirements in robustness, operating range (field of view, foresight, level of intervention) and number of different applications running in parallel, the fusion of data from different sensors may be necessary. This paper describes a fusion architecture which provides a base for safety and non-safety applications. The development objective for this architecture was the possibility to combine different sensors with only little adaptation effort for the various applications running in parallel. It should provide the ability to take both complementary and competitive aspects into account to ensure a reliable environment recognition. The paper shows the fusion architecture based on an example system - fusion of a Laser Scanner and a Mono Camera for a Collision Mitigation System (CMS). A Fusion Core combines the object lists from the Laser Scanner, a result of further development of the IDIS® sensor, and an Object Verification System based on a Mono Camera.

Apart from range extenders, flow batteries (redox batteries as one variant) which might be refilled with electrolyte similar to conventional vehicles and technological improvements, the exchange of batteries is a method allowing BEV's similar ranges and similar usability like vehicles with internal combustion engines as they are currently used. The suggested way for the investigation into the success of the concept holds a two fold approach: Mapping the innovation: Enumerating the influencing factors Assessing: In-depth research of acceptance In step one influence analysis (causal loop) is applied to determine the most active factors and the system dynamics. In step two a multi criteria decision analysis is employed in order to quantify the potential impact of the factors/characteristics on the probability of the success of the concepts. The two step methodology is presented for the battery exchange system (swappable battery), because for this system it is easiest to determine the technological aspects being purely mechanical and also the market impact based on the pre-existing knowledge of the facts. The range extenders and flow batteries still need technological research clarifying the operational characteristics of an industrialised concept before a robust assessment may be conducted. The paper anticipates the acceptance of the first mentioned concepts and enumerates the questions that have to be solved in order to allow a successful use case. The closing chapter analyses the influence of paradigm change on the assessment introducing uncertainties. In this respect it is shown how in depth foresight studies may reduce the risk for the innovator by introducing the actors/users introducing criteria for success and failure.","BEV's; Marketing; Taxation","Battery electric vehicles; BEV's; Flow batteries; Influence analysis; Market impacts; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Operational characteristics; Potential impacts; Redox batteries; Structured approach; System Dynamics; Technological aspects; Technological improvements; Vehicle technology; Commerce; Electric vehicles; Exhibitions; Factor analysis; Fuel cells; Internal combustion engines; Knowledge management; Marketing; Taxation; Uncertainty analysis; Innovation",,,,,"Swartbooi, A.M., Van Vuuren, D.S., Investigating Improvements on Redox Flow Batteries, , CSIR/MSM/EP/EXP/2006/0099/A; US Patent 6014597 - Distributed electric vehicle battery exchange network, or presented by the betterplace project of Shai Agassi; http://wot.motortrend.com/6250134/green/renault-debuts-electric-car- prototype-with-swappable-battery/index.html; Existing implementations are with the PEDELEC called flyer in tourism in Switzerland, planned implementation is claimed by the better place project by Shai Agassi; Matheys, J., Comparison of the environmental impact of 5 electric vehicle battery technologies using LCA PROCEEDINGS of LCE2006; Gamma, Topsim - Tata Interactive Systems; Diakoulaki, D., Grafakos, S., Multicriteria analysis, final report on work package 4 ExternE-pol externalities of en-ergy: Extension of accounting framework and policy (2004) Applications National Technical University Athens, Greece; Hausschildt, J., (1993) Innovationsmanagement, , Vahlens Handbücher; http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/10/30/video-of-project-better-places- battery-exchange-system; http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/49929/max- well_technologies_drives_standardization_of_ultracapacitors_with_introduction_o f_new; Winkler, Ch., Engineering Assessment of Current and Future Vehicle Technologies, , for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. Department of Transportation Washington DC 20590 March, 2005 The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI)","Cebrat, G.; FGM-AMOR, Schoenaugasse 8a, 8010 Graz, Austria; email: gcebrat@fgm.at",,,,"24th International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium and Exhibition 2009, EVS 24","13 May 2009 through 16 May 2009","Stavanger",93692,,9781615674558,,,"English","Int.

The article questions the inherent logic that tries to give a purpose to the military and gain international reputation by reinterpreting article 9 indiscriminately. Since 2004, the overseas dispatch of SDF forces into the Iraq combat zone has split the nation more than ever and a national consensus on what article 9 should stand for is further threatened by Government attempts to extend the application of article 9 to military activities outside Japan under the banner of collective defense. Ahead of the 2009 general election for the Lower House opposition and ruling parties have apparently agreed that time has come to review the text of article 9 for the first time after the war based on the premises of Realpolitik. Article 9 in its current wording still represents a very cherished core principle to the nation as a whole despite the military buildup and despite the tacit acceptance of the SDF and of the right to limited self-defense. The current popular mood against collective self-defense, against the overseas deployment of SDF, against the unequitable US-Japan Security Treaty and against nuclear weapons- termed ""negative pacifism""- differs from the voluntarist security policies in the election platforms of the LDP and DPJ. Ordinary citizens in and outside Japan have challenged the political elite by teaming up to preach the peaceful spirit of article 9 to the world. It is asserted that the intended revision of article 9 has caused lasting changes in civic political grass-root culture. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article 9; Japan; Pacifist principles; Realpolitik; Revision","armed forces; comparative study; election; elite politics; literature review; military government; party politics; peacekeeping; political theory; Japan",,,,,"Arendt, H., (2005) The Promise of Politics, , Schocken Books New York; (2007) Article 9's Global Impact.

Eskişehir, Turkey","Wind speed and solar radiation characteristics belonging to past years of a region are the main input parameters in wind-photovoltaic hybrid system (WPHS) sizing studies. Classically, these data are fed to several scenarios with different solar panel, wind turbine, and storage battery number combinations. The solutions with minimal cost which also satisfy the desired maximum loss of energy probability are selected. Since the utilized data have random fluctuations because of atmospheric phenomenon, past years' data are unlikely to appear in a similar manner in future years. Hence, using a robust model that characterizes the general behavior of the data instead of directly using past data should yield more accurate sizing solutions. In order to compare the sizing accuracy obtained by directly using the data to the accuracy obtained by indirect modeling from data, an analytical solar radiation model is first explained. Using this model, 3-year solar radiation data of three geographical sites are analyzed. It was observed that the differences between sample-by-sample hourly recordings corresponding to different years are significantly larger than the difference between these recordings and the data model obtained from an arbitrary year. This provides a hint that a sizing approach carried out using the data of a previous year would not be accurate in producing the same Loss of Load Probability (LLP) for a future year. On the contrary, the accuracy would improve if a generic analytical model of the solar radiation is used in the sizing process. This foresight is tested by comparing the LLPs obtained in the two ways mentioned above. Results obtained using available data are in accordance with the aforementioned propositions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, the context of transport policies is about to shift from a transport infrastructure network design towards the development of a large socio-technical system, depending largely on ICT technology and applications. Dynamic decision making clusters or networks, consisting of different actors and having a variety of goals, are growing around policy items or transport system innovations, and they need information and knowledge as the basis for their mutual decisions. This development will change the roles of the different actors within the system as well as the nature of strategies and measures. My key argument is that in this new context the traditional, analytical knowledge production approaches (such as ""planning"" and ""impact assessment"", referring to infrastructure investments and project appraisals) are alone not sufficient in providing the knowledge needed to understand the socio-technical nature of the transport system or the dynamics between the different actors, as a basis for transport policy development. The knowledge provided to make informed transport decisions needs to include, in addition to the traditional issues, also new forms to serve the needs of a wider variety of societal actors. Based on the field of science and technology studies (STS), which aims to illuminate the relationship between knowledge and political power as well as investigating the place of science and technology in society, I have identified five emerging forms that I consider relevant to transport policy knowledge production in the future. These are knowledge production through system-based foresight, knowledge production through system-based evaluation, knowledge production in networks, knowledge production as processes of social learning and argumentation, and knowledge production as a source of renewal. Further, I have identified the basic characteristics of these forms. I believe that the presented forms can shed light on the relationships between knowledge production, policy making and the society, which may lead to the implementation of new, socially embedded ways of developing transport systems and policies. The dissertation also presents implications of these emerging knowledge production forms for transport policy and business development (in Finland) and related future research needs. The thesis is an article dissertation including four scientific papers (Papers I-IV) and this summary chapter, bringing together and elaborating further on the ideas of the individual papers.

Asserting the predictive uncertainty of the simulation is important in the comparison of planning options. The valley wide regulated river system model is a cluster of independently calibrated component models such as irrigation model, a number of rainfall-runoff models, a number of hydrologic river routing models etc. Assigning confidence bands to simulation outputs is onerous as the multivariate residual errors are spatially related with strong serial correlation and unstable variance. For example, during spill periods the residual error of the reservoir level variable resets at every time step whilst during recession residuals exhibits long memory. Non linear error propagation towards both the upstream and downstream direction in the system is notable. Different calibration periods and the sample size of different component models mean that a multivariate set of residuals with sufficient sample size is often nonexistent. This paper uses a meta Gaussian approach to infer the simulation error. It does so by first transposing all the variable of interests using a Normal Quantile Function. The calibration error is then measured in the transformed space. A linear model is then fitted to the calibration error where the predictors are chosen from other simulated variable that exhibits physical dependence to this error. The linear model allows the separation of the bias and white noise portion of the calibration error. The confidence interval is then inferred from the fitted cumulative distribution of the white noise. The case study examined the simulations of the river system model known as the Integrated Quantity Quality Model (IQQM). The study selects the Peel River system of which the variables of interest are flow at three key locations, irrigation and urban water usage and storage volume. The calibration version of the full ensemble runs for 1982 to 2000 and long term planning model simulates from 1892 to 2005. The paper presents the predictive uncertainty of the flow at Carroll Gap by computing confidence band of the simulation. It does so by developing a linear model in meta Gaussian space where the predictors of flow residuals are storage volume, total diversion and the flow persistence. It filters the biased naïve residuals into white noise and thus infers confidence interval to long term flow simulation as shown in Figure 1. The paper also discusses various relevant unresolved issues for example calibration uncertainty versus predictive uncertainty and unstable transformation that offer foresight into future research opportunities.

Shared responsibility and consequently collective learning is a prerequisite for improvement of single activities, work processes to increased safety and total performance. In this paper we argue that collective learning is an important condition in creating improved safety and resilience in drilling operations. This is to say that HSE is about organizational development (OD) focusing specifically on collaborative capability for communication and operational decision-making. We elaborate on this issue in relation to implementation of new advanced information and communication technology (ICT) and the participatory process in exploring how to use ICT to support collaborative work and integration of all disciplines and participants involved in one shared real-time collaboration environment (SCE). The paper is based on a large R & D program on drilling and well within Integrated Operations (IO) in the Norwegian petroleum industry including empirical work done in the drilling and well (D&W) department in two Norwegian oil and gas companies. Parts of the empirical work relates to the implementation of equipments for optimization and automatisation of drilling operations on the rig as well as the development and use of an Integrated Drilling Simulator (IDS-) system in one of the drilling units on Ekofisk area (Rommetveit et al. 2008). Resilience is being defined in Hollnagel (2006) as - ""the ability of a system or an organization to react to and recover from disturbances at an early stage, with minimal effect on the dynamic stability"". This ability depends on the capability of foresight, coping and recovery, as described by Westrum (2006): ""Foresee and avoid"" - resilience is the ability to prevent something bad from happening, ""Coping with ongoing trouble"" - or the ability to prevent something bad from becoming worse and ""Repairing after Catastrophe"" - or the ability to recover from something bad once it has happened. The different types of threats are understood as deriving from combinations of normal variability in complex sociotechnical systems. As normal variability of both system conditions and performance is a source of both successes and failures, it is necessary to understand the nature of normal work and the strategies that are used to cope with conditional variations in order to understand how these are turned into success, which is seen as the flip side of failure. We argue that the collective learning involved in establishing and maintaining situational awareness of operational conditions is an important factor for building resilient organizations. We have observed that collective learning is about balancing and optimizing together three principal kinds of learning dimensions labelled How-, What- and Why-learning. These dimensions are identified as essential for developing improved collaborative capabilities and building the resilient organization. Each dimension is supported by its corresponding learning arena for common knowledge sharing and reflection of the drilling process as a whole. In this way, we have found that more effective work processes supporting knowledge sharing and learning can take place independently of organizational barriers, disciplines and across interfaces and consequently creating more resilient drilling operations.

Water authorities and communities have responded with a range of demand management and supply augmentation measures that include water conservation, water restrictions, irrigation system modernisation and renewal, new connections and pipelines and alternative supplies such as rainwater, stormwater, recycled water and seawater desalination. For water resources systems that relied on relatively inexpensive surface water, the 'costs' involved in the construction and operation of some of the new supply schemes present new challenges in planning and operations. There is now an increasing need to optimise water systems considering economic, social and environmental factors. Simulation modelling tools such as REALM have been widely used by many water authorities in Australia to assist with system planning and operations. REALM simulates the water allocation within a system in accordance with user-defined operating rules, but does not optimise the system operations over time. The operating rule inputs are often based on historical experience, or identified through trial-and-error processes. With the introduction of more expensive sources for which the optimum operating rules are yet to be identified, the limitations of such simulation tools have become increasingly evident. However, practical optimisation tools are not widely available or used, due to reasons that include the complexity of the approaches, expertise required, and the relatively inexpensive surface water sources that had been available. This situation has prompted Melbourne Water to develop an optimisation tool OPTIMISIR (OPTIMISIng Resources) to serve two purposes: (1) link with and supplement the existing REALM model to improve its simulation outcomes and (2) perform standalone optimisation to assist in identifying the optimum annual operating outlook. When supplementing a monthly-time-step REALM model, OPTIMISIR identifies at each month the optimum operations for the next 12 months, and passes the optimum solution to REALM to simulate next month's operations in detail. This corresponds to a scenario in real operations of a monthly update of the optimum annual operating plan. When used standalone, OPTIMISIR outputs the optimum annual operating outlook through a user interface. In both modes of use, OPTIMISIR accommodates optional inputs from less detailed long-term optimisation approaches. OPTIMISIR provides the choice of two optimisation methods: Linear Programming or Quadratic Programming, together with the flexibility for the user to specify system parameters and input scenarios and construct the objective function. When using Linear Programming, the model developed for the Melbourne Water Supply Headworks System representing 7 major harvesting reservoirs, the bulk water transfer system and 3 seasonal storage reservoirs close to Melbourne runs in less than 2 seconds in performing an optimisation for 12 months on a standard desktop computer used at Melbourne Water. The same model reformulated to run with Quadratic Programming takes about 6 seconds. OPTIMISIR has been tested through a range of example scenarios and has shown the potential to be a suitable optimisation tool for the Melbourne Water Supply System. Further development and more detailed testing of the OPTIMISIR are currently being undertaken by Melbourne Water prior to its potential application as part of a suit of tools to optimise the water supply system. The planned improvements include the incorporation of an 'imperfect streamflow forecast' capability. This aims to address the current shortcoming of assuming perfect foresight of next 12-month's streamflows when the tool is linked to the REALM model. The paper presents the key features of OPTIMISIR and its application to the Melbourne Water Supply System under several hypothetical streamflow and demand scenarios.","Linear programming; Quadratic programming; REALM; Water resource optimisation","Australia; Bulk water; Environmental factors; Further development; Historical experience; Irrigation systems; Key feature; Melbourne; Objective functions; Operating rule; Optimisation method; Optimisations; Optimum operations; Optimum solution; Potential applications; REALM; Recycled water; Seasonal storage; Seawater desalination; Significant impacts; Simulation tool; Standard desktop; Stormwaters; Streamflow forecast; Surface water sources; System operation; System planning; Trial-and-error process; Water allocations; Water resource systems; Water resources systems; Water restrictions; Water supply headworks; Water system; Computer simulation; Computer systems programming; Desalination; Linear programming; Mathematical models; Optimization; Quadratic programming; Seawater; Stream flow; Surface water resources; Surface waters; User interfaces; Water conservation; Water filtration; Water management; Water supply; Water supply systems; Reservoirs (water)",,,,,"Hughes, N., Hafi, A., Goesch, T., Brownlowe, N., (2008) Urban Water Management: Optimal Price and Investment Policy under Climate Variability, , Research Report 08.7, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics; Kularathna, M.D.U.P., (1992) Application of Dynamic Programming for the Analysis of Complex Water Resources Systems: A Case Study on the Mahaweli River Basin Development in Sri Lanka, , PhD Dissertation, Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands; Loucks, D.P., Stedinger, J.R., Haith, D.A., (1981) Water Resource Systems Planning and Analysis, pp. 44-93. , Prentice-Hall Inc, New Jersey; McMahon, T.A., Mein, R.G., (1986) River and Reservoir Yield, , Water Resources Publications, Colorado; Perera, B.J.C., Codner, G.P., Reservoir Targets for Urban Water Supply Systems (1996) Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 122 (4), pp. 270-279; Perera, B.J.C., Kularathna, M.D.U.P., Rhodes, B.G., Robust Operating Rules for Urban Water Supply Headworks Systems (1999) 25thHydrology and Water Resources Symposium, Brisbane, 6-8 July, pp. 202-207; Perera, B.J.C., James, B., Kularathna, M.D.U., Computer software tool REALM for sustainable water allocation and management (2005) Journal of Environmental Management, 77 (4), pp. 291-300. , DOI 10.1016/j.jenvman.2005.06.014, PII S0301479705002641","Kularathna, M.D.U.P.; Strategic Planning, Melbourne Water, PO Box 4342, Melbourne 3001, VIC, Australia; email: udaya.kularathna@melbournewater.com.au",,"CSIRO;Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute;Griffith University;eWater Cooperative Research Centre;Department of Sustainability and Environment",,"18th World IMACS Congress and International Congress on Modelling and Simulation: Interfacing Modelling and Simulation with Mathematical and Computational Sciences, MODSIM09","13 July 2009 through 17 July 2009","Cairns, QLD",86475,,9780975840078,,,"English","World IMACS Congr.

Production and provision costs aside, the resource cost is associated to the idea of opportunity cost, that is, the cost of the foregone opportunities other alternative users must bear as a consequence of the choice of allocating the resource to a certain use. Marginal resource opportunity costs (MROC) represent the benefit foregone for having available one unit less of resource at a given time and location. As such, they are a function of system's configuration as well as of the relevant socio-economic water - related variables in the area. MROC evaluation relies upon the concept of opportunity cost as second best alternative foregone for making a choice and is hence based on the idea that they must be assessed starting from some equilibrium (optimal) maximum - efficiency allocation of water resources in the system. Maximum efficiency is usually related to the idea of achieving minimum variable costs, including scarcity costs. Scarcity costs reflect the economic losses caused by water unavailability and must be assessed by appropriate loss functions for different water uses (urban, irrigation, etc.). A unit perturbation in the availability of a given resources at a certain time generates a new equilibrium condition, quantified by the selected efficiency measure (total costs). The shift in the value of the objective function (cost minimization) divided by the value of the perturbation provides an assessment of the MROC. Such assessment are directly provided by standard linear programming tools supplying shadow prices for relaxing the constraints (on maximum capacity) on a given resource. It may be questioned, however, whether long-term maximum efficiency water allocation assessed by an optimization model is realistically achievable in real world operation of water resources systems. Given perfect input foresight and other factors, marginal opportunity costs obtained by an optimization algorithm may be a lower bound for their likely values. As an alternative, it maybe worthwhile using simulation models for a description of system's operation using current allocation criteria. The MROC is obtained by decreasing of unit quantity resources availability at a given point and time step and evaluating the response (in terms of costs) of the system, thus obtaining an approximation of the opportunity cost. The paper is provocative to some extent, in that one of its goals is to quantify the impact of inefficient management of a system on the perception of resources costs and on the subsequent decisions on infrastructures that must be built to substitute or expand them, should this become necessary. The paper compares the outputs of a linear programming based - water allocation procedure and of a plain simulation model for the assessment of the marginal opportunity cost of groundwater resources in a realworld water resources system located in Southern Italy, where aquifer overexploitation concretely poses the problem of comparing different expansion alternatives to cope with the planned reduction of underground water withdrawals. The simulation model uses very simple operation rules (purposely oversimplistic, to some degree) to contrast results with those obtained adopting the idealized behavior of the omniscient decision maker of the optimization model. Results show that marginal opportunity costs can vary considerably with the methodology, as a consequence of the different underlying assumptions, optimization yielding an ideal maximum efficiency allocation and simulation providing an inefficient, but somehow more realistic, description of the allocation process. As the operating rule specifically employed in the simulation model pushes to the limits the contrast with those The results may be seen as upper and lower bounds for the marginal opportunity cost of resources in this specific context.","Optimization; Resource opportunity cost; Water resources system planning","Allocation process; Cost minimization; Decision makers; Decision making process; Economic loss; Efficiency measure; Equilibrium conditions; Framework directives; Integral part; Loss functions; Lower bounds; Maximum Efficiency; Objective functions; Operating rule; Opportunity costs; Optimization algorithms; Optimization models; Overexploitation; Real world operations; Related variables; Resource costs; Resource opportunity cost; Shadow price; Simple operation; Simulation model; Socio-economics; Southern Italy; Time step; Total costs; Upper and lower bounds; Variable costs; Water allocations; Water resources exploitation; Water resources system planning; Water resources systems; Water use; Aquifers; Computer simulation; Cost accounting; Costs; Decision making; Economics; Efficiency; Function evaluation; Linear programming; Losses; Mathematical models; Optimization; Rating; Water management; Water supply; Groundwater resources",,,,,"Andreu, J., Capilla, J., Sanchis, E., AQUATOOL, a generalized decision-support system for water-resources planning and operational management (1996) Journal of Hydrology, 177 (3-4), pp. 269-291; Andreu Alvarez, J., Velazquez, P., Collazos, G., Methodology and tools for integrated assessment of resources and environmental requirement costs (2008) Second International Workshop on Implementing Economic Analysis in the Water Framework Directive, Paris, France,17-18 February 2008, , Conference CD; Griffin, R.C., (2006) Water Resources Economics - The Analysis of Scarcity, Policies, and Projects, , MIT press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Haab, T.C., Mc Connell, K., (2002) Valuing Environmental and Natural Resources, p. 324. , Edwar Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham UK; Ilich, N., Shortcomings of linear programming in optimizing river basin allocation (2008) Water Resources Research, 44, pp. W02426. , doi: 10.1029/2007WR006192; Jenkins, M.W., Lund, J.R., Howitt, R.E., Using economic loss functions to value urban water scarcity in California (2003) Journal AWWA, 95 (2), pp. 58-70; Jenkins, M.W., Lund, J.R., Howitt, R.E., Draper, A.J., Msangi, S.M., Tanaka, S.K., Ritzema, R.S., Marques, G.F., Optimization of California's water supply system: Results and insights (2004) Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 130 (4), pp. 271-280. , DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(2004)130:4(271); Loucks, D.P., Van Beek, E., (2005) Water Resources Systems Planning and Management - An Introduction to Methods, Models and Applications, , Studies and Reports in Hydrology, UNESCO Publishing; Hsu, N.-S., Cheng, W.-C., Cheng, W.-M., Wei, C.-C., Yeh, W.W.-G., Optimization and capacity expansion of a water distribution system (2008) Advances in Water Resources, 31, pp. 776-786; Oliveira, R., Loucks, D.P., Operating rules for multireservoir systems (1997) Water Resources Research, 33 (4), pp. 839-852; Pulido-Velazquez, M., Jenkins, M.W., Lund, J.R., Economic values for conjunctive use and water banking in southern California (2004) Water Resources Research, 40, pp. W03401. , doi: 10.1029/2003WR002626; Tsur, Y., Dinar, A., On the relative efficiency of alternative methods for pricing irrigation water and their implementation (1997) World Bank Econ.

Especially technology management in changing markets has to deal with long lead times and high sunken costs, and hence handling the risk requires strategic agility and foresight. Scenarios, as a set of multiple possible future development paths, can inform decision makers of the drivers, which shape the future and thus help open-minded planning of actions. The objective of the study is to discuss the present scenario practice in relation to business and technology management, and to present a fresh alternative; the electronically mediated scenario process. Electronic tools offer an effective way to engage decision makers and stakeholders to the scenario process and facilitate efficient use of the time enabling equal contribution from diverse participants. This paper discusses two group support system (GSS)-mediated scenario methods, one heuristic and the other intuitive-logical, compares them to each other and to previous research. The contribution is a thorough discussion of the two method artifacts, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses and limitations, and positioning them to the present scenario practice. © 2009 PICMET.",,"Decision makers; Development path; Electronic tools; Fundamental changes; Group support systems; Long leads; Possible futures; Technology foresight; Technology managements; Decision support systems; Fluorine containing polymers; Heuristic methods; Industrial management; Technology; Risk perception",,,,,"Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of Futures Studies, 1-2. , New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers; Bergman, J.-P., (2005) Supporting Knowledge Creation and Sharing in the Early Phases of the Strategic Innovation Process, Lappeenranta, FI: Acta Universitatis Lappeenrantaesis, 212. , 180 p; Blanning, R.W., Reinig, B.A., A Framework for Conducting Political Event Analysis Using Group Support Systems (2005) Decision Support Systems, 38, pp. 511-527; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K.-H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario Types and Techniques: Towards a User's Guide (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 723-739; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., van der Heijden, K., The Origins and Evolution of Scenario Techniques in Long Range Business Planning (2005) Futures, 37, pp. 795-812; Chermack, T.J., Improving decision-making with scenario planning (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 295-309; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive Capacity: A new Perspective on Learning and Innovation (1990) Administrative Sci.

This modeling is the conceptual model describing the multilayer construction of technology flow and social trends. The multilayer consists of the field of science, technology, engineering, commerce, economy and policy. This multilayer operates with affecting each other. The multi-spiral is created by the phenomena of friction on the borders of each field. If the friction occurs with resulting from a variety of factors, for instance, the economic and the environmental crisis, the small spirals are created. The gathering small spirals become a tremendous spiral to give rise to new innovative market. Technology development makes economic active, creates and expands an innovative market. However the stagnation of innovative activities has a serious impact on society, market and technology. This study shows the framework of foresighting an innovative market by multiplayer modeling of intermittent economic society and progressive technology development. If the friction is discontinued, the creation of new innovative market is not valid.

If we consider that-according to an exhaustive study on small and medium enterprises in EU member countries-within one European SME out of six, strategies are issued and operated, we notice that from the point of view of strategic approach frequency, small and medium companies in our country are close to their homologues from developed countries, in spite of the big difference as competitiveness is concerned.

Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831, United States","The National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) was a collaborative effort between ORNL and PPPL. PPPL provided the assembly techniques with guidance from ORNL to meet design criteria. The individual vacuum vessel segments, modular coils, trim coils, and toroidal field coils components were delivered to the Field Period Assembly (FPA) crew who then would complete the component assemblies and then assemble the final three field period assemblies, each consisting of two sets of three modular coils assembled over a 120° vacuum vessel segment with the trim coils and toroidal field coils providing the outer layer. The requirements for positioning the modular coils were found to be most demanding. The assembly tolerances required for accurate positioning of the field coil windings in order to generate sufficiently accurate magnetic fields strained state of the art techniques in metrology and alignment and required constant monitoring of assembly steps with laser trackers, measurement arms, and photogrammetry. The FPA activities were being performed concurrently while engineering challenges were being resolved. For example, it was determined that high friction electrically isolated shims were needed between the modular coil interface joints and low distortion welding was required in the nose region of those joints. This took months of analysis and development yet the assembly was not significantly impacted because other assembly tasks could be performed in parallel with ongoing assembly tasks as well as tasks such as advance tooling setup preparation for the eventual welding tasks. The crew technicians developed unique, accurate time saving techniques and tooling which provided significant cost and schedule savings. Project management displayed extraordinary foresight and every opportunity to gain advanced knowledge and develop techniques was taken advantage of. Despite many risk concerns, the cost and schedule performance index was maintained nearly 1.0 during the assembly phase until project cancellation. In this paper, the assembly logic, the engineering challenges, solutions to those challenges and some of the unique and clever assembly techniques, will be presented.","Assembly; Coil joint; Field period; Metrology; Welding","Assembly tasks; Assembly techniques; Assembly tolerance; Coil joint; Coil winding; Collaborative efforts; Component assembly; Cost and schedule; Design criterion; Engineering challenges; Field period; In-field; Laser tracker; Low distortion; Metrology; Modular coils; National compact stellarator experiments; Outer layer; Strained state; Time-saving techniques; Toroidal Field coils; Vacuum vessel; Welding tasks; Distributed computer systems; Dust collectors; Magnetic fields; Phase interfaces; Project management; Vacuum; Welding",,,,,"Ellis, R., (2009) Dimensional control of NCSX field period assembly, , SOFE; Priniski, C., (2009) Metrology techniques for the assembly of NCSX, , SOFE; Dodson, T., (2009) Advantages of high tolerance measurements in fusion environments applying photogrammetry, , SOFE; Dudek, L.E., (2009) Testing of compact bolted fasteners with insulation and friction-enhanced shims for NCSX, , SOFE; Freudenberg, K.D., (2009) Performance evaluation and analysis of critical interface features of the national compact stellarator experiment (NCSX), , SOFE; Denault, M., (2009) Low distortion welded joints for NCSX, , SOFE; Strykowsky, R.L., (2009) Engineering cost & schedule lessons learned on NCSX, , SOFE","Viola, M.; Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), P.

These tensions include the ability (or otherwise) to underpin the foresight process with suf- ficient and appropriate 'objectivised' knowledge (including national statistics, international benchmarking data, and future-oriented 'intelligence'), the organisation of dialogic spaces that are not solely 'hijacked'by special interests and setting the 'granularity'of emergent priorities at a level that makes them 'operationalisable' in informing research and development fund- ing programmes. The exercise was organised by the FNR (Fonds national de la recherche or National Research Fund), the only research council in Luxembourg. The paper shows that the position of the FNR in the research landscape had both benefits and drawbacks during the conduct of the exercise as well as for the follow-up implementation. The paper builds upon an earlier paper which described the first phase of the FNR Foresight exercise. The current paper extends this analysis to the second and third phases of the exercise, as well as to the immediate implementation phase after the publication of its results. By doing so, it covers the evolution of the foresight exercise over its two-year life span, highlighting the different meanings given to the exercise by different stakeholder groups as the process unfolded and interim results were made known. The paper draws lessons not only for other small countries and regions hoping to use foresight, but also highlights principles for using foresight for priority-setting more generally. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Foresight; Luxembourg; Priority-setting; Research system","benchmarking; research and development; science and technology; stakeholder; technological development; Belgium; Luxembourg [Belgium]",,,,,"Crehan, P., Cassingena-Harper, J., Technology foresight in smaller countries (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight, , eds.

To achieve them, a tailor-made combination of methods was applied. This paper focuses on the concept design of the process and explains one of the methods - the future online survey - in more detail. The German Foresight Process of the BMBF delivers results on different levels: broader future fields as well as single future topics. Both kinds are relevant and selected according to a set of criteria. Some of the results of this foresight process will be directly integrated into national policy activities, others are just more indirectly filtered into the innovation system of the specific sectors in the country. The future fields are all cross-cutting issues based on science and technology. All of them are specifically knowledge dynamic fields. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It is based on a study of strategy processes in national research councils and programmes and the challenges faced by their strategy activities. We analysed the strategy processes of two organisations: the Danish Technical Research Council and the Danish Energy Research Programme. We analysed the mechanisms of the strategy processes and studied the actors involved. The actors' understanding of strategy was also included in the analysis. Based on these analyses we argue that the impact of foresight exercises can be improved if we have a better understanding of the traditions and new challenges faced by the research councils. We also argue that a more formal use of foresight elements might improve the legitimacy and impact of the strategic considerations of research councils and research programmes. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Foresight; Public research organisations; Science and technology and innovation policy studies; Socio-technical; Technology and innovation studies","innovation; organizational framework; research and development; research program; science and technology; technology policy; traditional knowledge; Denmark",,,,,"Eerola, A., Loikkanen, T., Joergensen, B.H., Dannemand Andersen, P., Eriksson, E.A., NordicH2energy foresight -complementary contribution of expert views and formal analyses (2004) Proceedings From the Eu-us Scientific Seminar: New Technology Foresight, Forecasting and Assessment Methods, pp. 13-14. , May, Seville, Spain; (2005) Final Report.

Empirically, the case at hand illustrates the challenges posed by stakeholder participation based on the concept of 'Inclusive Foresight'. A still understudied aspect of inclusive foresight is how these inclusion procedures are publically and politically legitimised, except with reference to the demand for more genuinely democratic decision-making. Drawing on fieldwork studies of a Norwegian municipal vision project conducted in 2006 it is shown how a specific image of young people was constructed which explained their participatory potential and argued for their authenticity as important social stakeholders. The term stakeholder image construction describes here a pre-defined process in which a social group is associated with seemingly inherent characteristics, including social, cognitive and political dimensions. By creating a specific image of young people, the project leadership resolved issues of stakeholder interests and futures literacy before they received their contributions. Constructing a desired image of specific stakeholders predefines considerably their potential as participants and the scope of their contributions in visioning projects. The article contributes to discussions of inclusive foresight by showing how stakeholder image construction poses questions of power relationships in municipal long term governance. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Foresight; Municipal planning; Participation; Stakeholder; Visioning","decision making; democracy; governance approach; local participation; stakeholder; urban planning; young population; Norway",,,,,"Beck, U., Bonss, W., Lau, C., The theory of reflexive modernisation: Problematic, hypotheses and research programme (2003) Theory, Culture & Society, 20, pp. 1-33; Berkhout, F., Hertin, J., Foresight futures scenarios: Developing and applying a participative strategic planning tool (2002) Greener Management International, 37, pp. 37-52; Böhle, K., Onkey issues of foresight: Participation, prioritisation, implementation, impact (2003) Technikfolgenabschätzung, 12 (2), pp. 32-8; Bood, R., Exploring the future as social practice (2002) Paper Presented At Conference On 'probing the Future: Developing Organizational Foresight In the Knowledge Economy, , 11-13 July 2002, University of Strathclyde Graduate School of Business, Glasgow, UK; The sociology of expectations in science and technology (2006) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 18 (3-4), pp. 285-298. , Borup, M., N.

Due to long life times of infrastructures, strategic decision making has to explicitly consider uncertainties in context conditions, value considerations and available technological alternatives. However currently, strategic infrastructure planning is often carried out in a very narrow perspective. The present paper argues that foresight informed strategic planning, allows addressing trade-offs related to context uncertainties, value conflicts and sustainability deficits in a structured way.

In this paper practical ways to reduce the deficit are proposed that ought to increase the responsiveness of Foresight programmes to society's values, concerns and expectations. The existence of the deficit is examined placing ever more emphasis on the need for the active participation by a balanced but wide spread of stakeholders who will help to shape the future of society through the practical scheme proposed. The notions of 'situations' and Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) are combined into a metaphor to suggest how the deficit in Foresight might be reduced. The purpose is to ensure, as far as that is possible, that the process of participation is genuine, inclusive and effective: practical steps toward this are suggested. The subjective nature of the metaphors assists the interpretation of these suggestions. The notion of 'situations' and Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) represents an attempt to provide a metaphorical foundation for inclusive Foresight. At their core, 'situations' and CSH consider that problem definitions, proposals for improvement, and evaluations of outcomes depend on prior judgements about the relevant system. The resulting framework that emerges from CSH is a set of boundary concepts usable as a checklist of critical boundary questions. The checklist may be grouped under four issues relating to sources of: (i) motivation, (ii) power, (iii) knowledge, and (iv) legitimization. The current paper discusses the application of the 'situation' cum CSH metaphor for the case of nano-science, nano-technology and nano-artifacts that are being widely adopted in areas such as materials, ICTs, and medicine. As a result of the growing interest for nano-field, nano-artifacts are now reaching the consumer markets within a large number of branches. On the other hand there is a growing scepticism about the nano-field regarding the environmental and health risks of nano-artifacts along with the ethical and legal issues arising as a result of the widespread use of these products. A number of processes have been designed and implemented concerning the legal, ethical and social impacts of nano-sciences, -technologies, and -artifacts. The paper suggests that inclusive Foresight, reinforced with the principles of CSH, can be of use in the nano-field providing wider stakeholder representation during the research and development processes. Such processes will contribute to the development of more socially and environmentally responsive nano-artifacts. © 2009.","Critical Systems Heuristics; Foresight; Inclusivity; Nanotechnology","Consumer market; Critical boundaries; Critical systems; Critical Systems Heuristics; Critical systems thinking; Legal issues; Practical schemes; Problem definition; Research and development; Social impact; Economic and social effects; Environmental regulations; Heuristic methods; Nanotechnology; Health risks; heuristics; nanotechnology; participatory approach; research and development; stakeholder; technological development",,,,,"Loveridge, D., European knowledge society foresight: The EUFORIA Project synthesis report (2003) Report to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living Conditions, Working Conditions and Industrial Relations, October; Cuhls, K., Government foresight activities in Germany: the Futur process (2003) Second International Conference on Technology Foresight Tokyo, 27-28 February; Loveridge, D., Street, P., Inclusive foresight (2005) Foresight: The Journal of Futures Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 7 (3), pp. 31-47; Weinberg, A.M., Science and trans-science (1972) Minerva, 10, pp. 209-222; (1993) The Politics of Expert Advice: Creating, Using and Manipulating Scientific Knowledge for Public Policy, , Barker A., and Peters B.G.

This process undoubtedly had a major impact on policy; in fact, several of the recommendations of the process were immediately translated into policy decisions, others are planned to be implemented in the years to come. In spite of this apparent success, a more critical and systematic assessment of the process shows that the apparent short-term success of the process seems to come at the cost of limited medium- to long-term impact, associated with a low degree of novelty and the avoidance of controversy. The impact assessment is based on a framework that focuses on three key functions of foresight in relation to policy making: informing, counselling, and facilitating policy making at short-, medium- and longterm. Obviously, only the short-term impact assessment can rely on empirical observations, but there are also several indications of likely shortcomings with respect to the medium- and long-term impacts. Moreover, evidence can be given of process mechanisms that have been conducive to the generation of rather conservative outcomes. After introducing the impact assessment framework and the general process design, objectives and results of the Viennese innovation policy foresight and strategy process and the different impact dimensions will be analysed and assessed for different time horizons. The reasons for success in terms of shortterm policy impacts will be highlighted, but also the factors that seem to hamper mediumand long-term impacts from arising. Finally, some generic lessons learned from the Viennese experience will be discussed. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Foresight; Innovation policy; Policy impact; Strategy process","innovation; policy analysis; policy making; strategic approach; technology policy; trade-off; urban area; Austria; Vienna",,,,,"Carlsson, B., Elg, L., Jacobsson, S., Reflections on the co-evolution of innovation theory, policy and practice: The emergence of the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (2006) Paper Presented At the 40th Anniversary Conference of Spru, 'the Future of Science, Technology and Innovation Policy: Linking Research and Practice', Brighton, , 11-13 September 2006; Cassingena Harper, J., Georghiou, L., The targeted and unforeseen impacts on innovation policy: The eFORESEE Malta case study (2005) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 2 (1), pp. 84-103; da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Scapolo, F., Cagnin, C., The impact of foresight on policy-making: Insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 20, pp. 369-87; (2007) Wiener Strategie Für Forschung, Technologie Und Innovation, p. 2007. , City of Vienna, Executive version, City of Vienna, November; (2007) Wiener Strategie Für Forschung, Technologie Und Innovation, p. 2007. , City of Vienna, Long version, City of Vienna, November; Dosi, G., The nature of the innovative process (1988) Technical Change and Economic Theory, pp. 221-38. , ed.

We find that, under a symmetric externality assumption, our static model admits a potential function, which allows us to identify a stationary state that is uniquely absorbing and globally accessible under the perfect foresight dynamics whenever the degree of friction in relocation decisions is sufficiently small. In particular, when trade barriers are low enough, full agglomeration in the country with the highest barrier is the unique stable state for small frictions. New aspects in trade and tax policy that arise due to forward-looking behavior are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research focused on the short run because of a widespread belief that in the long run the market reverts to well-established fundamentals. The authors' research suggests this belief should be questioned. First, they show actual dividends cannot account for the secular trends of stock market values. They then consider a more comprehensive measure of capital income, which displays large secular fluctuations that roughly coincide with changes in stock market trends. Under perfect foresight, however, this measure fails to properly account for stock market movements. The authors thus abandon the perfect foresight assumption and instead assume that forecasts of future capital income are performed using a distributed lag equation and information available up to the forecasting period only. They find that standard asset-pricing theory can be reconciled with the secular trends in the stock market. This study, nevertheless, leaves open an important puzzle for asset-pricing theory: The market value of U.S. corporations was much lower than the replacement cost of corporate tangible assets from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. © 2009, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",,,,,,,"Barsky, R.B., de Long, J.B., Why Does the Stock Market Fluctuate?

The similarities and development challenges of foresight, Technology Analysis (TA) and risk assessment methodologies are discussed in the light of the empirical material gathered from projects performed at VTT. Among the projects are IRRIIS project focusing on risk assessment of critical infrastructures, INNORISK project aiming at managing opportunities, risk and uncertainties in new business creation and a project related to the climate change (CES). The case projects are positioned according to their important design dimensions (informative vs. instrumental outcomes; consensual vs. diverse future perspectives, extensive vs. exclusive stakeholder involvement, and autonomous vs. fixed management). The common and complementary features of FTA and risk assessment are discussed, suggesting new ways to evolve the modular design when integrating FTA and risk assessment methodologies and tools. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A 71-year-old man with Klinefelter's syndrome who suffers from postural hand tremor is described. The electromyogram indicated lower motor neuron disturbance and chronic neurogenic change. The muscle biopsy indicated neurogenic muscle atrophy. Upon testosterone administration, the amplitude of tremor was reduced and a gradual improvement in handwriting was observed. The tremor in this patient was different from essential tremor. The foresight by Baughman in 1969 proved to be true in this patient.

We develop two versions so that we can solve the model either as a fully inter-temporal optimization problem (forward-looking, perfect foresight) or recursively. The standard EPPA model on which these models are based is solved recursively, and it is necessary to simplify some aspects of it to make inter-temporal solution possible. The forward-looking capability allows one to better address economic and policy issues such as borrowing and banking of GHG allowances, efficiency implications of environmental tax recycling, endogenous depletion of fossil resources, international capital flows, and optimal emissions abatement paths among others. To evaluate the solution approaches, we benchmark each version to the same macroeconomic path, and then compare the behavior of the two versions under a climate policy that restricts greenhouse gas emissions. We find that the energy sector and CO2 price behavior are similar in both versions (in the recursive version of the model we force the inter-temporal theoretical efficiency result that abatement through time should be allocated such that the CO2 price rises at the interest rate.) The main difference that arises is that the macroeconomic costs are substantially lower in the forward-looking version of the model, since it allows consumption shifting as an additional avenue of adjustment to the policy. On the other hand, the simplifications required for solving the model as an optimization problem, such as dropping the full vintaging of the capital stock and fewer explicit technological options, likely have effects on the results. Moreover, inter-temporal optimization with perfect foresight poorly represents the real economy where agents face high levels of uncertainty that likely lead to higher costs than if they knew the future with certainty. We conclude that while the forward-looking model has value for some problems, the recursive model produces similar behavior in the energy sector and provides greater flexibility in the details of the system that can be represented. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For determining risks, hazards have to be identified and representative accident scenarios defined. This needs effort and technique. Man is quite limited in foresight without having experience and lessons from the past. For knowing the risk of an incidental, undesired event both its severity and probability has to be estimated. Then ways to reduce risk become clear. In a process plant risks are many and it is not possible to remove them all. One has to attribute priorities. Intuitive and qualitative methods can do much, but plant complexity may be large and communication on risk may become difficult without formal methodology. Quantitative risk analysis offers much, but has its weaknesses and drawbacks. The required effort is considerable, specialists are needed, and variability in answers is large. Yet, a model built to go along with the life of an installation and updated periodically may be very useful. This paper presents an overview of the demand, problems encountered, possible remedies, and an outlook on useful improvement and extension of risk analysis methodology, including decision making. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are three established approaches to anti-pneumococcal vaccination: capsular polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV), protein-polysaccharide conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (CPV) and protein-based pneumococcal vaccine (PBPV). At present, only a 23-valent PPV for use in adults and a seven-valent CPV for use in infants are available in clinical practice. This study reviews available data on the efficacy of the available vaccines in different age groups and disease presentations, and the advantages and shortcomings of each type of vaccine, including future perspectives. Special attention is given to controversies regarding the efficacy of PPV against pneumonia in adults and its protective effects against myocardial infarction. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Myocardial infarction; Pneumococcal vaccine; Pneumonia","Pneumococcus vaccine; child; clinical trial; drug efficacy; heart infarction; human; morbidity; mortality; prevention and control; priority journal; review; Streptococcus pneumoniae; vaccination; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Pneumococcal Infections; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Vaccines, Conjugate",,"Pneumococcal Vaccines; Vaccines, Conjugate",,,"Ortqvist, A., Hedlund, J., Kalin, M., Streptococcus pneumoniae: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical features (2005) Semin Respir Crit Care Med, 26, pp. 563-574; Hausdorff, W.P., Feikin, D.R., Klugman, K.P., Epidemiological differences among pneumococcal serotypes (2005) Lancet Infect Dis, 5, pp. 83-93; Fedson, D.S., Pneumococcal vaccination for older adults: Tthe first 20 years (1999) Drugs Aging, 15 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 21-30; Prevention of pneumococcal disease: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) (1997) MMWR Recomm Rep, 46 (RR), pp. 1-24. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Bogaert, D., Hermans, P.W., Adrian, P.V., Rumke, H.C., De Groot, R., Pneumococcal vaccines: An update on current strategies (2004) Vaccine, 22, pp. 2209-2220; Vila-Corcoles, A., Advances in pneumococcal vaccines: What are the advantages for the elderly?

Foresight and road-map exercises are aimed at supporting planning and priority-setting of R&D and have become indispensable elements of policy-making. Besides technological development decision-makers need all-inclusive knowledge of future developments of society, economy and impacts of science and technology. When the worldwide competition is about the attractiveness of innovation systems, such knowledge is important for comparing the innovation performance of nations to other economies. Finland is among the countries improving her position in worldwide performance comparisons since the late 1990s and reached leading nations in early 2000s. This attainment raised national interest and critical debate of the reliability of the data basis and methodologies used in comparisons. In The Finnish Association of Graduate Engineers (TEK) this discussion led to a decision to develop an own comparative exercise together with VTT. In addition to performance analysis based on ex-post indicators the barometer includes the questionnaire of the views and visions of the future development by relevant national actors. The theoretical framework of the barometer is based on the evolution of economies from industrial development phase to sustainable knowledge society. The barometer has been undertaken in 2004, 2005 and 2007, and a wide interest and emerged discussion of barometer proves that a social interest and order exists for the barometer. The article presents the background, methodology and results of technology barometer, discusses its impacts on national discussion, and gives perspectives for the future development of barometer. © 2009.","Barometer; Future-oriented knowledge; Indicators; Innovation policy; Science and technology","Decision makers; Finland; Finnish; Graduate engineers; Indicators; Industrial development; Innovation performance; Innovation policies; Innovation system; Knowledge society; National innovation systems; Performance analysis; Performance comparison; Policy making; Roadmap; Science and Technology; Socio-economic development; Technological development; Theoretical framework; Barometers; Economics; Technological forecasting; Technology; Innovation; decision making; future prospect; innovation; policy making; research and development; science and technology; technological development; technology policy; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",,,,,"Nardo, M., Saisana, M., Saltelli, A., Tarantola, S., Hoffman, A., Giovannini, E., (2005) Handbook on constructing composite indicators.

Methods: We used a trans-theoretical analysis referring to three theories: (1) Construal Level Theory (Trope and Liberman) suggests that the human mind tends to assign remote events as ""high-level"" criteria, abstraction, in particular, and to proximal events as ""low-level"" criteria, a concrete description, in particular. (2) Intertemporal Choice Theory (Ainslie) explains why people often prefer short-term small rewards over long-term large rewards. (3) The theory developed by Parfit suggests that the personal identity of human beings is made of a succession of multiple individuals, in time, who find their identity by the fact that there is a connectedness between them. Since this connectedness is weaker for prolonged periods of time, this Personal Identity Theory may explain why we may be less interested in our future. Results: In the minds of people who are supposed to benefit from such programmes, there may be a striking contrast between the objectives of preventive medicine (typically a high-level construal), which represents an abstract and long-term concept (e.g. ""to avoid complications""), and that of the representation of inaction, a low-level construal which is by contrast immediate and concrete and can be readily imagined (e.g. a nap in front of the TV set). Conclusion: The very concept of prevention entails features that jeopardize the efficiency of educational programmes used for its implementation. Practice implications: (1) In chronic diseases, designing programmes proposing concrete and short-term preventive measures may represent a way to overcome this obstacle. (2) Habit may be used to reinforce connectedness which forms personal identity. (3) Thus, taking into account this temporal dimension of educational programmes is essential. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These systems have a common feature: under perfect foresight (or rational expectations) they all possess a unique fixed point steady state. This long-term outcome is obtained also under learning if the quality underlying the learning process is high. Otherwise, when the degree of inefficiency of the learning process is relatively strong, nonlinear dynamics (periodic and a-periodic cycles) arise. The specific properties of each one of the proposed systems is explored both in terms of local and global dynamics.

Fifty-seven governments were involved, together with many development actors and representatives of the agricultural and agrifood sectors, the academic world and civil society. This innovative, cross-disciplinary study marked an important paradigm shift, representing a broad consensus among the experts to the effect that agriculture is multi-functional and multi-factorial; that it requires approaches that take account of the specific contexts in which it is carried out, involving all the players in the supply chain and having regard to local forms of knowledge. This new paradigm, which marks a retreat from reductive, universal solutions, offers diverse options for action. Beyond questions of the quantity of knowledge accumulated and its limitations, IAASTD marks a decisive development that the various actors must now take on board.

However, in studying both past and future trends, network perspectives are often missing. Since networks are capable of revealing the structure that underpins relationships between stakeholders, key issues and actions in the past, they are powerful to help envisage the future. The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodological framework to incorporate network analysis in foresight. Design/methodology/approach: The paper develops a generic framework to incorporate network analysis into foresight's five stages. Trends identified by respondents of the Big Picture Survey are used to demonstrate how we operationalize this framework. Findings: A network perspective can enrich foresight analysis in that it helps reveal structural linkages between trends and thus can better identify emerging future issues, both of which are critical in foresight. Research limitations/implications: The inclusion of network analysis can shed light on the process of understanding complex data and assist in building a model based on links and relationships. Network analysis can reveal otherwise unobservable structural features of the data and can help boundary setting discussions in foresight. Practical implications: Network concepts and measures could usefully enrich the interpretation of foresight data for further analysis, or plausible scenarios. Originality/value: Network analysis offers a new way of looking at the foresight data by disentangling complicated issue webs. As shaping the future becomes more essential because of the complexity of science, technology and society interrelationships, the incorporation of network perspectives in foresight might be one of the ways to propel future studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Networking; Social networks",,,,,,"Allen, J., James, A.D., Gamlen, P., Formal versus informal knowledge networks in R&D: A case study using social network analysis (2007) R&D Management, 37 (3), pp. 179-196; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., How to analyze large networks with Pajek (2003), Workshop at SUNBELT XXIII, Cancún, México; Borgatti, S.P., How to explain hierarchical clustering (1994) Connections, 17 (2), pp. 78-80; Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., Freeman, L.C., (2002) Ucinet VI for Windows: Software for Social Network Analysis, , Analytic Technologies, Harvard, MA; (2005) Models and Methods in Social Network Analysis, , Carrington, P.J., Scott, J., Wasserman, S.

First, to describe in detail a particular sub-class of powerful prospective methods based on the method of “morphological analysis”. And second, to extend their use to create a basis for strengthening strategic analysis and policy development. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the history and use of morphological methods in foresight work, and briefly describes three main “lineages” currently in use, and proposes some extensions to models of practice. Findings – Recent research in cognitive psychology suggests that requiring a detailed and systematic examination of future possibilities before a decision is made leads to more effective assessments of futures. Morphological methods, by design and construction, are perfectly suited to this, and so can form an exceptionally strong basis for thinking systematically about the future. Practical implications – The paper also describes how to go about designing a foresighting capacity based on a systematic evaluation of future systemic contexts, as well as discussing what aspects of the external environment to include in robust competitive intelligence, strategic monitoring, environmental scanning, and “horizon scanning” activities. Originality/value – The paper proposes some extensions to existing practice and describes some ways to tie the development of a strategic meta-language to clearly-targeted intelligence scanning. This paper should be of interest to anyone involved in trying to strengthen strategy development, policy planning or intelligence analysis. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Competitive strategy; Intelligence; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Abraham, A., Schubotz, R.I., von Cramon, D.Y., Thinking about the future versus the past in personal and non-personal contexts (2008) Brain Research, 1233, pp. 106-119; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45 (7), pp. 1363-1377; Addis, D.R., Pan, L., Vu, M.-A., Laiser, N., Schacter, D.L., Constructive episodic simulation of the future and the past: distinct subsystems of a core brain network mediate imagining and remembering (2009) Neuropsychologia, 47 (11), pp. 2222-2238; Ainslie, G., Foresight has to pay off in the present moment (2007) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 30 (3), pp. 313-314; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ayres, R.U., (1969) Technological Forecasting and Long-Range Planning, , McGraw-Hill, New York, NY; Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies, , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: an overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K.-H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario types and techniques: towards a user's guide (2006) Futures, 38 (7), pp. 723-739; Buckner, R.L., Prospection and the brain (2007) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 30 (3), pp. 318-319; Buckner, R.L., Carroll, D.C., Self-projection and the brain (2007) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11 (2), pp. 49-57; Chermack, T.J., Disciplined imagination: building scenarios and building theories (2007) Futures, 39 (1), pp. 1-15; Cornish, E., (2004) Futuring: The Exploration of the Future, , World Future Society, Bethesda, MD; Coyle, R.G., Morphological forecasting – field anomaly relaxation (FAR) (2003) Futures Research Methodology, , in Glenn, J.C. and Gordon, T.J.

Gene patents for therapeutics have often been litigated but have received surprisingly little public outcry. In stark contrast, genetic diagnostics have been highly controversial but rarely litigated: no case has gone to trial and there is little case law to guide policy. Most recently the Secretary's Advisory Committee for Genetics Health and Society (SACGHS) released a draft report examining how patenting and licensing affect access to clinical genetic testing in the US. The SACGHS reported that patents neither greatly hindered nor facilitated patient access to genetic testing; both the harms and the benefits of patents on genetic diagnostics have been exaggerated. Problems do occur when patents are exclusively licensed to a single provider and no alternative is available. Courts have been changing the thresholds for what can be patented, and how strongly patents can be enforced. Technologies for sequencing, genotyping and gene expression profiling promise to guide clinical decisions in managing common chronic diseases and infectious diseases, and will likely be an integral part of personalized medicine. Developing such genomic tests may require mapping a complex intellectual property landscape and cutting through thickets of patented DNA sequences and related methods. Our preliminary studies have found patent claims that, if strictly enforced, might block the use of multi-gene tests or full-genome sequence data. Yet new technologies promise to reduce the costs of complete genomic sequencing to prices that are comparable to current genetic tests for a single condition. Courts, companies, and policy makers seem unlikely to allow intellectual property to obstruct such technological advance, but prudent policy will depend on careful analysis and foresight. The SACGHS report signals that the US government is paying attention, and increases the odds that policy will foster socially beneficial uses of genetic testing while preserving intellectual property incentives and mitigating the problems that arise from legal monopolies. © 2009 BioMed Central Ltd.",,"complementary DNA; advisory committee; cost; DNA determination; DNA sequence; evidence based medicine; gene expression profiling; genetic screening; genetic variability; genetics; genomics; genotype; human; jurisprudence; law; law suit; licence; note; patent; policy; priority journal; uncertainty",,,,,"Georgetown University: DNA Patent Database http://dnapat-ents.georgetown.edu/, (accessed 10 September 2009); Jensen, K., Murray, F., Intellectual property, Enhanced: intel-lectual property landscape of the human genome.

JAFC has expanded coverage of current areas of intense interest, such as bioactive constituents of foods, biotechnology, and biobased products and biofuels, as well as continuing strong coverage of such mainstream categories as food chemistry/ biochemistry, analytical methods, safety and toxicology, and agrochemistry. In 2008 alone, JAFC published over 1650 peer-reviewed manuscripts, several symposia (largely from AGFD symposia at ACS National Meetings), and a number of reviews. The synergy between AGFD and JAFC offers many benefits and exciting opportunities for advancing the science of agricultural and food chemistry for the future. © 2009 American Chemical Society.","Agfd 100th anniversary symposium; History; Jafc","agriculture; article; food; food analysis; health care organization; history; organization and management; publication; United States; Agriculture; Food; Food Analysis; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Periodicals as Topic; Societies, Scientific; United States",,,,,"Murphy, W.J., Why the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistryl (1953) J.

The emergence of the community oriented web (web 2.0) opens a window of opportunity for a new generation of foresight exercises, with a higher interactivity, better focus of expertise, a larger use of Internet resources and, most important, an accumulative content development. The paper describes the framework architecture of a web 2.0 based platform for foresight and describes its properties in the perspective of cognitive psychology and evolutionary economics. The paper concludes that such platforms may represent the basis of future oriented communities able of developing complex databases of future trends related to complex systems.","Delphi method; Evolutionary cognitive systems; Foresight; Online communities; Web 2.0",,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., (2000) Learning and Memory, , 2nd, John Wiley and Sons; Bunsdorf, G., Process of knowledge sharing: From cognitive psychology to economics (2003) The Economics of Knowledge Sharing, , Helmstadter Ernst (ed.)

Entrepreneurs carry out a highly complicated composite act. They need intelligence to collect and digest information about business opportunities. They need foresight about the possibilities new technologies and other developments create. They need judgement and leadership skills to found a company and guide its growth. They need communication skills to enthuse financiers to back their vision. The number of active entrepreneurs therefore depends on how many individuals possess these skills. But skills are not endowments. Individuals decide to develop those skills that advance their well being and to forgo developing those that do not. The prospects of a career as an entrepreneur depend on the economic environment, which can be facilitative or detrimental. A multitude of factors determine this environment: rules and regulations, the quality of government, the availability of education, and the ambient culture. © Oxford University Press, 2006.

By examining likelihood estimates rooted to specific time points during an unfolding event sequence (videos and short text stories), judged both in foresight and hindsight, we conceptualized hindsight bias as a contrast between two ""inevitability curves,"" which plotted likelihood against time. Taking timing into account, we defined three new indicators of accuracy: linear accuracy (how well hindsight judgments capture the linear trend of foresight judgments over time), rate accuracy (how well hindsight judgments reflect the slope of foresight judgments over time), and temporal accuracy (how well hindsight judgments specify the overall timing of the full envelope of foresight judgments). Results demonstrated that hindsight judgments showed linear and rate accuracy, but were biased only in terms of lack of temporal accuracy. The oft-used catchphrase ""knew it all along effect"" was found to be a misnomer, in that participants were well aware in hindsight that their earlier foresight judgments reflected uncertainty. The current research therefore points to one way in which retrospective judgments can be considered biased, yet simultaneously suggests that considerable accuracy exists when people render such judgments. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A five-round Delphi exercise (with 1454 contributions), based on the priorities of the 2005-2007 Latin American and Caribbean Action Plan for the Information Society (eLAC2007), was implemented. This exercise aimed at identifying future priorities that offered input into the inter-governmental negotiation of a 2008-2010 Action Plan (eLAC2010). It is believed to be the most extensive online participatory policy-making foresight exercise in the history of intergovernmental processes in the developing world to date. In addition to the specific policy guidance provided, the major lessons learned include (1) the potential of Policy Delphi methods to introduce transparency and accountability into public decision-making, especially in developing countries; (2) the utility of foresight exercises to foster multi-agency networking in the development community; (3) the usefulness of embedding foresight exercises into established mechanisms of representative democracy and international multilateralism, such as the United Nations; (4) the potential of online tools to facilitate participation in resource-scarce developing countries; and (5) the resource-efficiency stemming from the scale of international foresight exercises, and therefore its adequacy for resource-scarce regions. Two different types of practical implications have been observed. One is the governments' acknowledgement of the value of collective intelligence from civil society, academic and private sector participants of the Delphi and the ensuing appreciation of participative policy-making. The other is the demonstration of the role that can be played by the United Nations (and potentially by other inter-governmental agencies) in international participatory policy-making in the digital age, especially if they modernize the way they assist member countries in developing public policy agendas. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, none of the estimates made in the European Delphi surveys have been formally assessed in retrospect, while this process has been incorporated into the Japanese surveys since 1996. Taking the UK Technology Foresight Programme, this research sets out to assess the estimates of three of the fifteen panel Delphi surveys. Whilst on average 2/3 of Delphi statements were predicted to be realised by 2004, it will be shown that only a fraction of these statements had been realised by 2006. Based on the evidence collected from the published panel reports, the 'Hindsight on Foresight' survey conducted by OST in 1995 and interviews with panel members, it will be argued that the overwhelming majority of estimates were overly optimistic. While optimism and strategic gaming of experts is the most convincing explanation for these results, process factors were also explored, including the quality of expert panels used, the Delphi statements and the respondents of the Delphi questionnaire. It is argued that at least the issue of short-range optimism and strategic gaming of experts should be addressed in future Delphi exercises, as decision makers relying on expert advice cannot deal with this issue alone. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Subjects overinvest, relative to Nash. We separately consider whether subjects draw inferences, in hindsight, and use foresight to delay profitable investment and learn from market activity. In contrast to Nash, cursed equilibrium, and level-k predictions, behavior hardly changes across our experimental treatments. Maximum likelihood estimates are inconsistent with belief-based theories. We offer an explanation in terms of boundedly rational rules of thumb, based on insights about the game, which provides a better fit than quantal response equilibrium.

On the basis of a longitudinal case study of the evolution of three network security software firms, we find that the effects of managerial cognition can be detected at three distinct levels of capability development. At the level of operational capabilities, instrumental cognition affects the way in which capabilities are developed. At the level of a firm's capability portfolio, shifts in management's attention regarding capability development cause different evolutionary paths to emerge. Finally, at the extended enterprise level, managerial foresight influences the way in which a firm's capability constellation morphs over time. Our findings provide novel empirical evidence and contribute to an improved understanding of the role of managerial cognition in capability development. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Adner, R., Helfat, C.E., Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities (2003) Strategic Management Journal, 24, pp. 1011-25; Afuah, A., How much do your co-opetitors' capabilities matter in the face of technological change?

If a coalition replaces the status quo a with a contestant b, then b becomes the new status quo, and the vote goes on until a candidate is reached that no winning coalition is willing to replace. It is well known that the core, that is, the set of undominated alternatives, may be empty. To alleviate this problem, Rubinstein [Rubinstein, A., 1980. Stability of decision systems under majority rule. Journal of Economic Theory 23, 150-159] assumes that voters look forward one vote before deciding to replace an alternative by a new one. They will not do so if the new status quo is going to be replaced by a third that is less interesting than the first. The stability set, that is, the set of undominated alternatives under this behavior, is always non-empty when preferences are strict. However, this is not necessarily the case when voters' indifference is allowed. Le Breton and Salles [Le Breton, M., Salles, M., 1990. The stability set of voting games: Classification and generecity results. International Journal of Game Theory 19, 111-127], Li [Li, S., 1993. Stability of voting games. Social Choice and Welfare 10, 51-56] and Martin [Martin, M., 1998. Quota games and stability set of order d. Economic Letters 59, 145-151] extend the sophistication of the voters by having them look d votes forward along the iterative process. For d sufficiently large, the resulting set of undominated alternatives is always non-empty even if indifference is allowed. We show that it may be unduly large. Next, by assuming that other voters along a chain of votes are also rational, that is, they also look forward to make sure that the votes taking place later on will not lead to a worst issue for them, we are able to reduce the size of this set while insuring its non-emptiness. Finally, we show that a vote with sufficient foresight satisfies a no-regret property, contrarily to the classical core and the stability set. © 2009.","Core; Foresighted core; No-regret property; P-core; Stability set; Voting games",,,,,,"Andjiga, N.G., Moyouwou, I., A note on the non-emptiness of the stability set when preferences are weak orders (2006) Mathematical Social Sciences, 52, pp. 67-76; Arrow, K.L., (1963) Social Choice and Individual Values. 2nd ed., , Yale University Press, New Haven Connecticut; Brams, S.J., (1976) Paradoxes in Politics, , Free Press, New York; Chakravorti, B., Far-sightedness and the voting paradox (1999) Journal of Economic Theory, 84, pp. 216-226; Chwe, M., Farsighted coalitional stability (1994) Journal of Economic Theory, 63, pp. 299-324; Condorcet, M., (1785) Essai sur l'Application de l'Analyse à la probabilité des décisions rendues à la pluralité des voix, , Paris, France; Harsanyi, J.C., An equilibrium-point interpretation of stable sets and a proposed alternative definition (1974) Management Sciences, 20, pp. 1472-1495; Le Breton, M., Salles, M., The stability set of voting games: Classification and generecity results (1990) International Journal of Game Theory, 19, pp. 111-127; Li, S., Stability of voting games (1993) Social Choice and Welfare, 10, pp. 51-56; Martin, M., Quota games and stability set of order d (1998) Economic Letters, 59, pp. 145-151; Martin, M., A note on the non-emptiness of the stability set (2000) Social Choice and Welfare, 17, pp. 559-565; Martin, M., Merlin, V., The Stability set as a social choice correspondence (2002) Mathematical Social Sciences, 44, pp. 91-113; Martin, M., Merlin, V., On the characteristic numbers of voting games (2006) International Game Theory Review, 4, pp. 643-654; Nakamura, K., The vetoers in a simple game with ordinal preferences (1979) International Journal of Game Theory, 8, pp. 55-61; Pongou, R., Diffo, L.L., Tchantcho, B., Cooperation, stability and social welfare under majority rule (2008) Economic Theory, 35, pp. 555-574; Roth, A.E., Subsolutions and the supercore of cooperative games (1976) Mathematics of Operations Research, 1, pp. 43-49; Rubinstein, A., Stability of decision systems under majority rule (1980) Journal of Economic Theory, 23, pp. 150-159; Vickrey, W., Strong and weak solutions in the theory of games (1953) Mimeograph; von Neumann, J., Morgenstern, O., (1944) Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, , Princeton University Press","Tchantcho, B.; University of Yaounde 1, Higher Teachers Training School, Department of MathematicsCameroon; email: btchantcho@yahoo.fr",,,,,,,,01654896,,MSOSD,,"English","Math.

Frequently we allow access to these common resources when bad luck is assisted by foolishness and lack of foresight. Sometimes we may even help ourselves to a few of those common assets since others are doing so and they are public goods, the cost of which is shared and has already been paid. Moral hazard is the questionable ethical practice of increasing opportunity for individual gain while shifting risk for loss to the group. Bailout is an example. What makes moral hazard so widespread and difficult to manage is that it is easier for individuals to see their advantage than it is for groups to see theirs. Runaway American healthcare costs can be explained in these terms. Cheating, overtreatment, commercialism, and other moral problems in dentistry can be traced to the interaction between opportunistic individual behavior and permissive group responses common in moral hazard.",,"article; decision making; ethics; human; medical ethics; morality; United States; Decision Making; Ethical Relativism; Ethics, Dental; Humans; Moral Development; Principle-Based Ethics; United States",,,,,,"Chambers, D.W.",,,,,,,,00027979,,,"19928367","English","J Am Coll Dent",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-75349110751

W. Gregory arrived in Glasgow from Melbourne in 1904 to take up the post of foundation Professor of Geology in the University of Glasgow. Soon after his arrival in Glasgow he began to push for the setting up of teaching in Geography in Glasgow, which came to pass in 1909 with the appointment of a Lecturer in Geography. This lecturer was based in the Department of Geology in the University's East Quad. Gregory's active promotion of Geography in the University was matched by his extensive writing in the area, in textbooks, journal articles and popular books. His prodigious output across a wide range of subject areas is variably accepted today, with much of his geomorphological work being judged as misguided to varying degrees. His 'social science' publications - in the areas of race, migration, colonisation and economic development of Africa and Australia - espouse a viewpoint that is unacceptable in the twenty-first century. Nonetheless, that viewpoint sits squarely within the social and economic traditions of Gregory's era, and he was clearly a key 'Establishment' figure in natural and social sciences research in the first half of the twentieth century. The establishment of Geography in the University of Glasgow remains enduring testimony of J.W. Gregory's energy, dedication and foresight. © 2009 Royal Scottish Geographical Society.","Fiords; Great Rift Valleys; History of geography; JW Gregory and tectonics","geography education; history of geography; research; teaching; twenty first century; Africa; East Africa; Kenya; Rift Valley; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,"Balestrieri, M.L., Stuart, F.M., Persano, C., Abbate, E., Bigazzi, G., Geomorphic development of the escarpment of the Eritrean margin, southern Red Sea from combined apatite fission-track and (U-Th)/He thermochronometry (2005) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 231, pp. 97-110; Bishop, P., Long-term landscape evolution: Linking tectonics and surface processes (2007) Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 32, pp. 329-365; Bishop, P., Tectonic and Related Landforms (2008) The History of the Study of Landforms or the Development of Geomorphology Volume 4: Quaternary and Recent Processes and Forms (1890-1965) and the Mid-Century Revolutions, pp. 56-105. , in: R.

However,they have difficulty in supporting their claims, since previously their evidence typically was derived from individual case studies. Constituents and decision makers are often sceptical, believing that individual cases are either inapplicable to their situation or non-randomly selected to support a particular view. Planners need objective evidence based on a large body of experience to support the case for mitigation. Such is the unique contribution of a recent U.S. study that found that each dollar spent in three federal natural hazard mitigation grant programs (the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Project Impact, and the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program) saves society an average of $4 in future avoided losses. Complementing the aggregate benefit-cost analysis with community-based evaluations, the study yielded insights on how planners can improve long-term community resilience in the face of extreme events. Valuable lessons for mitigation planners and policy makers emerged: the need to consider a wide variety of losses, the importance of mixing qualitative with quantitative analysis, the value of averaging results over a large number of projects, and the need to more explicitly address social issues and data collection in order to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience to cope with twenty-first century hazards. © 2009 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.","Aggregate benefit-cost analysis; Hazard mitigation","cost-benefit analysis; extreme event; hazard management; natural hazard; policy making; North America; United States",,,,,"(2000) Mitigation Success Stories in the United States, , http://floods.org/Publications, Association of State Floodplain Managers, [online].

We present a case of northern possibilities to utilise renewable energy sources within agriculture in a form of alternative bioenergy scenarios. Altogether 20 experts participated in the Delphi process which outlines the future of bioenergy production in Finland. The first round of the Delphi study was carried out by semi-structured interviews and the second feedback round by means of a mail questionnaire. Background information of key variables was presented to the panellists who responded with their views on developments between 2004 and 2025. Alternative scenarios were then constructed from these dimensions with cluster analysis in line with the Disaggregative Policy Delphi (DPD) approach. Quantitative statements were complemented with the experts' argumentation. Five scenarios were constructed: 1) Renewable prosperity, 2) Incremental change, 3) Vision of sun, wind and wood, 4) Let's burn it all, and 5) Flood of waterpower. After the Delphi rounds, a dialogue seminar for the agri-technology experts and policy-makers was organised. These results bring to the table an agri-food technology expert community view of the future directions for Finnish agro-bioenergy use. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper outlines the overall approach and the methods it employed, along with some implications and emerging themes from this first iteration. Findings – The paper casts new light on patterns of activity in the futures/foresight arena that, in turn, lead to policy questions, including those of purpose and effectiveness. Originality/value – The SoPiFF project is of interest not only for its early results, but also for the use of the metascanning methodology outlined here. At one level it draws attention to the nature of the foresight practitioner's toolkit. At another it may also help to guide decisions about future resourcing options and the nature of training that is offered within the domain. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Forecasting; Forward planning; International cooperation; Research",,,,,,"Australian Foresight Institute (AFI) monograph series on social foresight (2004-2006), available at: www.swin.edu.au/agse/courses/foresight/monographs.htm.

To ""lack one's own government"" is a status neither precise nor transparent. At a minimum, though, it includes the situation captured by the definition of statelessness in international law: a person is stateless if ""not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law."" 2 The international community has acknowledged Arendt's insight about the perils of this situation by enshrining and widely supporting three interrelated principles: the right to a nationality, 3 the right to a legal identity, 4 and the obligation to reduce child statelessness. 5 Yet, over half a century since Arendt wrote about the unenforceability of human rights, and despite the proliferation of human rights institutions, regional agreements, diasporic identities, and celebrations of global citizenship, child statelessness appears to be a growing problem. In 2006, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced that 5.8 million people were stateless. 6 Even though this figure is already more than double the number identified in any prior year, UNHCR emphasized that ""the real total is believed to be nearer 15 million."" 7 The disjuncture between the two figures is revealing. The first represents those who are technically stateless- people who do not have a nationality according to the international law definition cited above. But, those in the second group (nearly three times the size of the first according to UNHCR) also ""lack their own government"" in Arendt's sense: they are de facto or functionally stateless, unable to enforce rights that are supposedly inalienable. A peculiarly disenfranchised population that clearly illustrates this functional statelessness and its dire consequences is the subset of child migrants who lack their own government. I will call this population Arendt's children. This article explores their ambiguous position between inalienable and unenforceable rights. It inquires what it means-to invoke Arendt again-to assert that these migrant children, like all children, have a right to have rights. First, it discusses what statelessness means for children today and how legal and functional statelessness impinge on their lives. It enquires into the rights that children are entitled to as a matter of law and contrasts this with the enforcement capabilities of states in practice. It also examines the effect of treaty ratification on rights realization and investigates particular areas of relevant policies such as age determination and information gathering. The discussion then turns to the consequences of rights denial, including detention and expulsion, and the efficacy of litigation as a rights enforcement strategy. Migrant children's access to economic and social rights, particularly education and health care, is reviewed. Finally, the article investigates what is required to reduce the functional statelessness of migrant children, concluding with a discussion of whether Arendt's children can be considered citizens and the consequences of their compromised status.",,"child health; human rights; international law; migratory population",,,,,"HANNAH ARENDT, THE ORIGINS OF TOTALITARIANISM 291-92, 293 (1966); Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, adopted 28 Sep. 1954, art. 1(1), 360 U.N.T.S. 117 (entered into force 6 Jun. 1960); Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted 10 Dec. 1948, G.A.

As stated above, not all left behind children are functionally stateless; those whose parents are migrant workers sending back remittances and eventually planning to return may be in a relatively satisfactory situation, The picture is complex, and the evidence on the impact of parental migration on children left behind shows that while some groups benefit from the enhanced income and related opportunities, others suffer from isolation, lack of supervision, and other difficulties, However, children whose parents are refugees and who are left behind pending family reunification are likely to be marginalized by the home state and to lack access to protection and fundamental rights. In this sense, they too can be considered Arendt's children; Mayeka v. Belgium, App. No. 13178/03, 2006-XI Eur. Ct. H.R; Id. ¶¶ 87, 105, 114.

Belgian law allows undocumented migrants to be detained for five months without charge or other legal procedures. Each time the migrant resists removal or deportation, the clock restarts. As a result, many migrants endure long periods in this state of exception, including the 1,000 to 2,000 unaccompanied minors who arrive in Belgium each year.

Factor analysis was used to examine a sample of 3,154 knowledge workers to reveal a four factor solution of Framer, Adapter, Tester, and Reactor. The first and last factors partially matched Dian's original conceptualization of Futurist and Reactionist. The four new factors, when taken together, explained 41.72% of the variance with scale reliability ranging from .66 to .89. Item analysis eliminated 19 questions from the FSA that had relatively lower correlations with items in their set. The refined 26-item FSA is a valid and reliable instrument with construct validity, although further efforts could be undertaken to locate Dian's original factors.","Assessments; Cognitive styles; Diffusion innovation; Factor analysis; Foresight; Futures studies; Leadership; Quantitative research; Strategic foresight; Temporal perspective",,,,,,"Ackoff, R.L., (1969) A concept of corporate planning, , New York: Wiley-Interscience; Argyris, Chris, Putnam, R., Smith, M.D., (1985) Action science, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; Aritzeta, A., Barbara, S., Swailes, S., Team role preference and cognitive styles: A convergent validity study (2005) Small Group Research, 36 (4), pp. 404-436. , August; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice-Hall; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York: W.H.

The physiochemical properties of PEG [poly(ethylene glycol)] and advantages of PE-Gylation for drug conjugates are introduced briefly. The technology of PEGylation of protein and small molecular drug conjugates and application to drug investigation are presented in detail. It is found that PEGylation technology can effectively improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs by altering the structures of drug conjugates. It also presents a method to extend the area of clinic application of drug conjugates. The foresight of development and investigation of PEGylation of drug conjugates is also brought forward based on the discussion of advantages and investigation status in quo of PEGylation technology.","PEGylation; Protein; Small molecular drug",,,,,,"Bailon, P., Berthold, W., (1998) Pharm.

This relies on an available seismotectonic zonation and earthquake catalogue, but makes use of a set of very recent, expressly developed attenuation relations. The long period picture of ground motion hazard is illustrated vis-à-vis the conventional one based on ground acceleration, and the feasibility of simple approximations of the displacement spectra, useful for design purposes, is shown. We give some foresight on the differences to be expected in hazard maps resulting from the use of a predominantly fault-based seismic source model, as opposed to the more conventional model that includes only spatially extended zones. Finally, we highlight the different hazard exposure of different regions depending on whether we represent hazard with a long or a short period parameter and we discuss the adequacy of recent code provisions regarding elastic displacement spectra. © 2009, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.",,"Conventional models; Displacement response spectra; Elastic displacements; Elastic response spectra; Fault-based; Ground accelerations; Ground motion hazard; Hazard map; Seismic hazards; Seismic source; Seismotectonics; Short periods; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Geotechnical engineering; Hazards",,,,,"Abrahamson, N.A., State of practice of seismic hazard evaluation (2000) Proceedings of GeoEng 2000, , Melbourne, Australia; Akkar, S., Bommer, J.J., Prediction of elastic displacement response spectra in Europe and the Middle East (2007) Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics, 36 (10), pp. 1275-1301. , DOI 10.1002/eqe.679; Baker, F., Korista, S.D., Novak, L.C., Engineering the world's tallest-Burj Dubai (2008) Proc.

Many feel intuitively that these distinctions are morally significant, but attempts to explain why this might be so have been unconvincing. In this paper, I explore the problem from an explicitly consequentialist point of view. I first review and endorse the arguments that the distinctions cannot be drawn with perfect clarity, and that they do not have the kind of fundamental significance required to defend an absolute prohibition on killing. I go on to argue that the distinctions are nonetheless important. A complete consequentialist account of morality must include a consideration of our need and ability to construct and follow rules; our instincts about these rules; and the consequences (to the agent and to others) that might follow if the agent breaks a good general rule, particularly if this involves acting contrary to moral instinct. With this perspective, I suggest that the distinctions between killing and letting die and between intending and foreseeing do have moral relevance, especially for those involved in the care of the sick and dying. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","Double effect principle; Euthanasia; Intention; Terminal care; Withholding treatment",,,,,,"Anscombe, E., Medalist's address: Action, intention, and 'double effect' (2001) The Doctrine of Double Effect: Philosophers Debate a Controversial Moral Principle, , ed.

The paper examines the exercises and consequent responses to this shift at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The paper develops and applies a coherent classification framework for foresight exercises. The framework provides practical support for the design and management of foresight projects, as well as supports the overall management of the portfolio of different kinds of foresight activities.

In order to enhance the reflexive capacity of foresight practice, a reframed perspective can be proposed, by considering individual foresight projects within the broader conceptual framework of 'future-oriented debates', analogous to the models of 'hybrid forum' or of 'strategic conversation' developed respectively in the fields of sociology of science and strategy, consisting both of the succession of foresight operations on a common theme, and of the community of actors associated to their discussion. Foresight can then be considered as an intervention in such a future-oriented debate, aiming at incremental change, with the objective to improve its quality, for which some criteria can be proposed. The usefulness of this change of perspectives from project management to the management of change is illustrated by the example of the international debate on future water scarcity.","Foresight; Forum; Future-oriented debate; Incremental change; Intervention","conceptual framework; future prospect; operations technology; project management; strategic approach",,,,,"Alcamo, J., Henrichs, T., World water in 2025: Global modelling and scenario analysis for the World Commission on Water for the 21st Century (2000), Kassel; Berkhout, F., Normative expectations in systems innovation (2006) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 18 (3), pp. 299-311; Bootz, J.P., Prospective et apprentissage organisationnel (2001) Travaux Et Recherches De Prospective, p. 2001. , Futuribles International, Paris; Callon, M., Lascoumes, P., Barthe, Y., (2001) Agir Dans Un Monde Incertain: Essai Sur La Démocratie Technique, , Seuil, Paris; Clark, P., Booth, C., Rowlinson, M., Procter, S., Delahaye, A., Project Hindsight: Exploring necessity and possibility in cycles of structuration and co-evolution (2007) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 19 (1), pp. 69-81; Cosgrove, W., Rijsberman, F., (2000) World Water Vision: Making Water Everybody's Business, , Earthscan/World Water Council, London; De Jouvenel, B., (1964) L'art De La Conjecture, , Editions du Rocher, Monaco; Falkenmark, M., Lindh, G., How can we cope with the water resources situation by the year 2050?

The aim of this article is to discuss the usefulness of developing foresight in a business wargame. Wargaming, a role-playing simulation of a dynamic situation, has been used mainly by the military, but more recently, it has also been used in the context of competitive intelligence and strategy-testing in organisations. A business wargame typically evolves several years into the future, allowing the participants to 'experience' future dynamics in the organisational environment and, consequently, to develop foresight. This article argues that, because of its participative and dynamic nature, business wargaming can overcome cognitive barriers, challenge mental models, detect weak signals of change in an organisational environment, re-direct attention in an organisation, and assist an organisation in developing foresight.","Business wargaming; Foresight; Scenario planning; Weak signals","business; computer simulation; future prospect; organizational framework; signal",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan, New York; Andlinger, G.R., Looking around: What can business games do?

The article presents and analyses results from a green technology foresight of nano-, bio- and information- and communication technologies initiated by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency with the purpose of acquiring knowledge about the environmental potentials and risks related to the three areas of technology. The foresight was organised with a social shaping of technology (SST) approach to the field in order to cater for the complex relationship between societal demands, technology options, innovation dynamics and environmental impacts. The approach involved studying actor-networks, laboratory programmes and technology trajectories as well as deconstructing different stakeholders' high tech visions. The identified environmental potentials and risks related to the three areas of technology and recommendations for future governance of research, innovation and application areas are discussed.","High tech visions; Laboratory programmes; Research and innovation policy; Social shaping of technology; Technology foresight","biotechnology; environmental impact; governance approach; high technology industry; information and communication technology; laboratory method; nanotechnology; technological development",,,,,"Andersen, M.S., Jørgensen, U., The support for cleaner technologies: Results, diffusion and future activities - An evaluation of the support programmes 1987-1992 (1997), Danish Environmental Protection Agency, Copenhagen; Berkhout, F., Hertin, J., Impacts of information and communication technologies on environmental sustainability: Speculations and evidence (2001), Report to the OECD.Science and Technology Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex, Brighton; Bijker, W.E., (1995) Of Bicycles, Bakelites and Bulbs: Towards A Theory of Sociotechnical Change, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Bras-Klapwijk, B., (1998) Adjusting Life Cycle Assessment Methodology for Use in Public Policy Discourse, , Delft University of Technology; Brown, N., Rappert, B., Webster, A., (2000) Contested Futures: A Sociology of Prospective Technoscience, , Ashgate, Aldershot; Callon, M., Some elements in a sociology of translation: Domestication of the scallops and fishermen of St Brieuc Bay (1986) Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge?, pp. 196-233. , Routledge & Paul Kegan, London; Callon, M., Techno-economic networks and irreversibility (1991) A Sociology of Monsters: Essays on Power, Technology and Domination, , Routledge, London; Clausen, C., Yoshinaka, Y., Social shaping of technology in TA and HTA (2004) Poiesis & Praxis, 2 (2), pp. 221-246; Dosi, G., Technological paradigms and technological trajectories: A suggested interpretation of the determinants and directions of technological change (1982) Research Policy, 11, pp. 147-162; Elam, M., Bertilsson, M., (2002) Consuming, Engaging and Confronting Science: The Emerging Dimensions of Scientific Citizenship, , STAGE (Science, Technology and Governance in Europe) Discussion Paper 1, Gothenburg University and Copenhagen University; Freeman, C., Perez, C., Japan: A new national system of innovation?

A novel method is needed to take into account the wide-ranging and complex factors, shaping the future of the higher education system. 'Futures' should be devised in a multi-level structure as the bulk of trends and driving forces are international in their nature and universities are embedded in broader socio-economic systems. This new approach is demonstrated here by devising 'cascading' futures for the European Union (EU), the European Research and Innovation Area (ERIA) and universities. Several advantages can be expected from this type of prospective analysis: (i) the potential changes of these broader settings, in which universities operate, as well as their impacts on higher education can be explored; (ii) the huge diversity of higher education systems and individual universities can be reflected; and (iii) the likely impacts of different policy options can also be explored. It is also proposed to select foresight programmes from the 'prospective toolkit', given their specific features and benefits compared to other prospective methods.","Foresight; Higher education; Multiple futures in a multi-level structure; Prospective analysis","academic performance; educational development; European Union; future prospect; higher education; innovation; socioeconomic conditions; trend analysis; university sector",,,,,"Aghion, Ph., Dewatripont, M., Hoxby, C., Mas-Colell, A., Sapir, A., Why reform Europe's universities?

Discussing some cases of m-government technologies and applications worldwide, the paper identifies a number of risks and research questions to be further elaborated. In practice, are we about to go through a major adapting societal move, partly due to information and communication technologies (ICTs) but also to other co-factors likely to influence our near future (socio-political-economic and environmental trends), or are we just passing through a natural evolution (eventually faster than others occurred in the past)?

In the Kumano Basin, there are two seafloor benchmarks that are located about 60 and 80 km away from the deformation front of the Nankai Trough, respectively. The observations from 2005 to 2008 have illustrated that these benchmarks are moving at rates of about 5-6 cm/yr with uncertainties of 1-3 cm/yr relative to the stable Amurian plate. In this study, in order to estimate interplate coupling along the Nankai Trough, we calculated surface deformations accompanied with plate subduction in an elastic half-space and compared them with on- and offshore GPS velocities obtained by GPS/Acoustic technique. Then, we investigated the effect of observation for the seafloor crustal deformations on slip resolution on the plate interface. We conclude that offshore crustal deformation data provide good constraints for the estimation of fault slips at the shallower part of the plate interface, especially at the depths of 10-20 km, where slip resolution is low without using offshore geodetic data. Future additional crustal deformation observations on the seafloor would lead to the better estimation of seafloor velocities, which help us receal strain accumulation process in the seismogenic subduction zone during interseismic period.",,"coupling; crustal deformation; estimation method; seafloor; subduction; uncertainty analysis; Kumano Basin; Nankai Trough; Pacific Ocean",,,,,"Altamimi, Z., P.

Processes and the degree of method application of strategic foresight are less investigated in small- and medium-sized enterprises. Based on case study research of 30 biotechnology companies in Germany, six different approaches of strategic foresight are identified. The study shows how strategic foresight is organised, which methods for strategic foresight are implemented, who is responsible for strategic foresight, what the main characteristics of the different approaches are, and how the strengths and weaknesses of strategic foresight practice in biotechnology firms can be characterized. Furthermore, firms' requirements for suitable foresight processes and methods are identified within the scope of case study research. © 2009 Imperial College Press.","Biotechnology; Case study research; Scenario analysis; SME; Strategic foresight; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Almeida, P., Dokko, G., Rosenkopf, L., Startup size and the mechanisms of external learning: Increasing opportunity and decreasing ability?

The paper looks to re-orient the technology foresight community to adopting an explicit pro-poor perspective when considering future developments in science and technology (S&T). Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a general overview of existing technology foresight studies from organizations located in North America, Europe, and Asia. By describing the key points made in a selection of foresight studies, the paper emphasizes the conceptual links between forward-looking analysis related to S&T and poverty-related issues. Findings: The paper reaches two main conclusions about the role of S&T foresight and development. The first is that the foresight research community needs to interact more closely with the development community in order to enhance the value of the findings in each field to the other. Second, the pressing matter of poverty alleviation requires that the foresight community should come together and create a sense of urgency in issues that have long-term implications but need immediate action and attention. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited to an approach that provides an overview of existing work in technology foresight. While no such review could be comprehensive, this paper provides examples of technology foresight analysis from a range of geographies, sectors, and perspectives to help mitigate this gap. Practical implications: The argument suggests that technology foresight practitioners should make issues of poverty an explicit topic or category of analysis in future technology foresight activities. Including poverty issues in future scenario activities would go a long way to closing this gap. Originality/value: This paper synthesizes ideas from a variety of forward-looking studies addressing the future of science and technology and identifies the need to include poverty as a dimension for analysis in future studies. In addition, the paper provides an introduction to technology foresight work being conducted in Asia by the APEC Center for Technology Foresight. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forward planning;

The paper addresses how a new conceptualization of globalization intersects with the field of foresight by describing the Rockefeller Foundation's approach to addressing complex issues of human development. A forward looking research component is a valuable organizational structure that can add value by tracking and monitoring current and emerging trends relevant to the Foundation's strategic framework, operational initiatives, and areas of work. The paper suggests a closer interaction of foresight and development experts and practitioners by suggesting that individuals in both disciplines need to work more closely together to coherently address the multitude, interlocking global challenges of the 21st century. The paper introduces the notion of “smart globalization” to the foresight community and details how this mindset has influenced and directed the ongoing work of the Rockefeller Foundation. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Complexity theory; Globalization; Human resource development; Philanthropy; Poverty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349528124

This is in line with the fundamental mandate of the Rockefeller Foundation, dating from its establishment. Design/methodology/approach: The objective was to capture concepts that the author has been developing and teaching under the heading of ""Forward engagement"". Forward engagement is a particular approach to anticipatory governance, drawing upon complexity theory for assessment of issues requiring government policy; network theory for proposed reforms to legacy systems of governance to enable them to manage complexity under conditions of accelerating change; and cybernetic theory to propose feedback systems to allow ongoing measurement of the performance of policies against expectations. For more detail, visit www.forwardengagement.org. Findings: The paper sketches out some core elements of a system for anticipatory governance. Originality/value: In addition to the primary findings of forward engagement (see web site), this paper argues that foresight and anticipatory concepts can play a vital role, not only for governance in the United States, but for governance in developing countries: perhaps even more so, because such countries have narrower margins for response to significant changes of circumstance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complexity theory; Forward planning; Governance",,,,,,"(2009), www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1414&fuseaction=topics.home, Foresight and Governance Project, Foresight and Governance Project - The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, available at: (accessed 14 May 2009); (2009), www.millennium-project.org, (The) Millennium Project, The Millennium Project: Global Futures Studies and Research, available at: (accessed 14 May 2009); (2009), www.pnsr.org, Project on National Security Reform, Project on National Security Reform, available at: (accessed 14 May 2009); (2009), www.rsis.edu.sg/cens/our_work/risk_assess_horizon_scan.html, Risk Assessment/Horizon Scanning, Risk Assessment/Horizon Scanning, available at: (accessed 14 May 2009); (2009), http://web.eduskunta.fi/Resource.phx/parliament/committees/future.htx, (The) Committee for the Future - Parliament of Finland, The Committee for the Future - Parliament of Finland, available at: (accessed 14 May 2009); (2009), www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/ppd/index.html, Directive Presidential Policy, Presidential Policy Directive - 1: Organization of the National Security Council System, available at: (accessed 14 May 2009)","Fuerth, L.

Design/methodology/approach: A general review is employed to highlight scenarios shaping Africa's economic governance and the magnitude of their impact on pro-poor growth. Potential responses are identified to address African vulnerabilities to poor governance and alternative dimensions to achievable equitable future are recommended for implementing those measures as a way forward. Findings: The paper observes that changes to the policy environment should include reform in Africa's governance and policy processes by supporting participation by a variety of actors including the poor rural farmers and women among others. Research limitations/implications: A broader literature review to support some of the recommended alternative dimensions is needed. Practical implications: The existing economic governance structure in Africa does not include stakeholders. Changes to the policy environment should include reform in Africa's economic governance and policy processes by supporting participation by a variety of actors including the poor rural actors (farmers and women) among other underrepresented groups.

Today, roughly 2.6 billion people use fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural waste and animal dung to meet most of their daily energy needs for cooking and heating. There are 1.6 billion people in the world without electricity, equal to over a quarter of the world population. The purpose of this paper is to present pro-poor solutions for addressing the crippling impacts of current global energy use on the world's poorest people. Design/methodology/approach: The paper lays out scenarios for global energy demand and greenhouse-gas emissions and highlights the impact of these trends on developing countries. Based largely on publications and research from the International Energy Agency, it shows that better targeted subsidies, capacity building, integrated policy approaches and improvements in data collection can help to alleviate the impacts of current energy use on health and the environment. Findings: Decisive action is needed to expand energy access and to arrest the potential impacts of climate change in poor countries. It is demonstrated here that investments in programs that are tailored to promoting development and addressing climate change simultaneously can be successfully deployed. Originality/value: There is an urgent need for policymakers in rich and poor countries to join together and tackle the global energy and climate challenges, and, as this paper shows, pro-poor foresight is needed to ensure that these challenges are met in an equitable and sustainable way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climatology; Developing countries; Energy; Energy consumption; Poverty",,,,,,"(2007) World Energy Outlook 2007: China and India Insights, , International Energy Agency (IEA), OECD/IEA, Paris; (2008) Energy Technology Perspectives 2008: Scenarios and Strategies to 2050, , International Energy Agency (IEA), OECD/IEA, Paris; (2008) World Energy Outlook 2008, , International Energy Agency (IEA), OECD/IEA, Paris","Malyshev, T.; International Energy Agency, Paris, France; email: Teresa.MALYSHEV@iea.org",,,,,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349535981

A group of experts, all of them members of the UK's National Advisory Committee for Aerospace Manufacturing (NACAM), selected six technology themes that were considered to be emerging/ growing and would have an impact on aerospace manufacturing technologies. This study included benchmarking and foresight exercises. Based on the results of this study, a bibliometric approach has been used to examine the prioritisation of the selected technologies. The results indicate that most of the technologies ranked highly by the experts have proved to be emerging and of importance according publication and patents, with some exceptions. Overall, the consensus between the NACAM experts, patents and publications perspectives implies a high degree of confidence in the results.

A model illustration for the association between impulsiveness and timing deficits is the impulsiveness disorder of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD have deficits in timing processes of several temporal domains and the neural substrates of these compromised timing functions are strikingly similar to the neuropathology of ADHD. We review our published and present novel functional magnetic resonance imaging data to demonstrate that ADHD children show dysfunctions in key timing regions of prefrontal, cingulate, striatal and cerebellar location during temporal processes of several time domains including time discrimination of milliseconds, motor timing to seconds and temporal discounting of longer time intervals. Given that impulsiveness, timing abnormalities and more specifically ADHD have been related to dopamine dysregulation, we tested for and demonstrated a normalization effect of all brain dysfunctions in ADHD children during time discrimination with the dopamine agonist and treatment of choice, methylphenidate. This review together with the new empirical findings demonstrates that neurocognitive dysfunctions in temporal processes are crucial to the impulsiveness disorder of ADHD and provides first evidence for normalization with a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; Impulsiveness; Methylphenidate; Temporal discounting; Time perception; Timing","cognition; modeling; motility; nervous system; central stimulant agent; methylphenidate; adolescent; article; attention deficit disorder; brain; child; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug effect; human; impulsiveness; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; reaction time; time perception; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Brain; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Child; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Methylphenidate; Reaction Time; Time Perception",,"methylphenidate, 113-45-1, 298-59-9; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Methylphenidate, 113-45-1",,,"Arnsten, A.F.T., Stimulants: Therapeutic actions in ADHD (2006) Neuropsychopharmacology, 31, pp. 2376-2383. , doi:10.1038/sj.npp. l301164; Ashtari, M., Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A preliminary diffusion tensor imaging study (2005) Biol.

A cohort of 30 patients, who were treated with a ForeSight (Smith&Nephew, USA) intramedullary nail between the years 2000 and 2005, were included in the study. In total, pseudoarthrosis formation was seen in 21 patients, and forearm refractures were seen in 9 patients. The average length of time between trauma and resurgery was 15 months (range of 4 to 32 months). Postoperatively, early and late complications were evaluated, as well as radiological and functional results. During resurgery, a total of 42 intramedullary nails were used in 30 cases of forearm fracture. Radiological proof of healing was observed in all patients: this was seen in 25 patients after 6 months, 3 patients after 12 months, and in 2 patients after 18 months. The average duration of healing was 18.45 weeks. Ranges of movement of the wrist, the forearm, and the elbow were classified according to the Anderson method. Excellent results were achieved in 9 patients, good results in 13 patients, and sufficient results in 8 patients. No patient exhibited insufficient results or complete rigidity of the wrist or the elbow. The results of our study corroborate the possibility of using stabilised intramedullary nailing for revision surgery of the forearm. The corrective surgery indicated must take into account the type of pseudoarthrosis present for a specific therapy, continually respecting the essentials of osteosynthesis stabilisation. A selective operative technique, meticulous follow-up of infections, and promotion of bone healing are paramount.","Diaphyseal forearm fractures; Intramedullary interlocking nailing; Non-union; Refracture","adult; aged; article; clinical article; cohort analysis; elbow; female; follow up; forearm fracture; fracture healing; human; intramedullary nail; intramedullary nailing; male; plastic surgery; postoperative complication; pseudarthrosis; range of motion; reoperation; surgical technique; treatment outcome; wrist",,,"ForeSight, Smith and Nephew, United States","Smith and Nephew, United States","Aho, A.J., Nieminen, S.J., Salo, U., Luoma, R., Antebrachium fractures: Rush pin fixation today in the light of late results (1984) Journal of Trauma, 24 (7), pp. 604-610; Babhulkar, S.S., Pande, K., Babhulkar, S., Nonunion of the diaphysis of long bones (2005) Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, (431), pp. 50-56. , DOI 10.1097/01.blo.0000152369.99312.c5; Bartoníček, J., Diaphyseal forearm fractures (2005) Acta Chir Orthop Traum Čech, 67, pp. 133-137; Boussouga, M., Bousselmame, N., Lazrek, K., Taobane, H., Le traitement chirurgical des fractures isolées de la diaphyse ulnaire (2002) Acta Orthop Belg, 68, pp. 343-347; Deluca, P.A., Lindsey, R.W., Ruwe, P.A., Refracture of bones of the forearm after the removal of compression plates (1988) Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series a, 70 (9), pp. 1372-1376; Hak, D.J., Lee, S.S., Goulet, J.A., Success of exchanged reamed intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft nonunion or delayed union (2000) J Orthop Trauma, 14, pp. 178-182; Hart, R., Elbow arthrolysis (2000) Acta Chir Orthop Traum Čech, 67, pp. 329-335; Hart, R., Janeček, M., Buček, P., Elbow joint - Orthopaedics and traumatology (2002) Brno: Centa; Hofmann, A., Hessmann, M.H., Rudig, L., Kachle, R., Rommens, P.M., Intramedulläre Nagelosteosynthese der Ulna in der Revisionschirurgie (2004) Unfallchirurg, 107, pp. 583-592; Chapman, M.W., Gordon, E., Zissimos, A.G., Compression-plate fixation of acute fractures of the diaphyses of the radius and ulna (1989) Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series a, 71 (2), pp. 159-169; Ring, D., Allende, C., Jafarnia, K., Allende, B.T., Jupiter, J.B., Ununited diaphyseal forearm fractures with segmental defects: Plate fixation and autogenous cancellous bone-grafting (2004) Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series a, 86 (11), pp. 2440-2445; Sage, F.P., Medullary fixation of the fractures of forearm (1959) J Bone Joint Surg, 41 (A), p. 1489; Schöne, G., Behandlung von Vorderarmfrakturen mit Bolzung (1913) Munch Med Wochenschr, 60, pp. 23-27; Smith, H., Sage, F.P., Medullary fixation of forearm fractures (1957) J Bone Joint Surg, 39 (A), pp. 91-98; Stern, P.J., Drury, W.J., Complication of plate fixation of forearm fractures (1983) Clin Orthop Rel Res, 175, pp. 25-29; Taller, S., Lukáš, R., Buchar, J., Intramedullary nailing of adult forearm fractures (2000) Acta Chir Orthop Traum Čech, 67, pp. 181-186; Von Saal, J., Review of complications in intramedullary nailing (1950) J Bone Joint Surg, 32 (B), p. 717; Wright, R.R., Schmeling, G.J., Schwab, J.P., The Necessity of Acute Bone Grafting in Diaphyseal Forearm Fractures: A Retrospective Review (1997) Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, 11 (4), pp. 288-294","Višňa, P.; Department of Traumatology, Motol University Hospital, V Úvalu 84, 150 06 Praha, Czech Republic",,,,,,,,12113395,,SMFME,,"English","Scr.

What then is the intention of human attempts to create nano-artifacts of increasing complexity? What may be their purpose? Why is so much effort being made globally to create nano-science and nano-technology to be the basis of nanoartifacts? How much progress is being made toward vague and undeclared goals? When may some of these goals be reached? These are some of the issues for foresight (anticipation) to explore through appreciation of the situation that now characterises the nano-world of human endeavour. Later an example will be used to illustrate the interdependencies within these situations over an extended time horizon notionally up to 2050. However, first it is necessary to indicate briefly how the present nano-world situation has been reached, a matter of foresight's close relation to hindsight. Subsequently, the concepts of situations, systemic foresight and panarchy, and their interrelatedness are outlined. Also illustrated is how they work in harness with the six foresight themes Social, Technology, Economics, Ecology, Politics and Values (acronym STEEPV) and appreciation. There are two examples. One dwells on some current anticipations of the future for nano-science, nano-technology and nano-artifacts. The other illustrates how situations, systemic foresight and panarchy illuminate four interdependent themes that are important to the future of the nano-field. Throughout, what is colloquially called 'nanotechnology' is considered as three interdependent parts nano-science, nano-technology and nano-artifacts. Two of these, nano-science and nanotechnology, support the creation of nano-artifacts. The paper also indicates briefly the relevance of industrial ecology. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

Scenario planning is a way to describe the present state of the world and develop several hypotheses about the future of the world, thereby enabling discussions about how the world ought to be. Scenario planning thus is not only a tool for learning and foresight, but also for leadership. Informed decision making by experts and political leaders becomes possible, while simultaneously allaying the public's perception of the risks of new and emerging technologies such as nanotechnology. Two scenarios of the societal impact of nanotechnology are the mixed-signals scenario and the confluence scenario.

It has been a long journey, more than five years for the programme to arrive at this juncture, succeeding through sheer commitment and will of the Science and Technology initiatives under which the programme has been implemented. Considering the spontaneous and natural challenges that are bound to make the effort of implementing the GLP compliance programme tougher for any country, the progress made by the Indian GLP programme can be considered very rapid. Though the dawn of full OECD membership for the Indian GLP programme is imminent the paper deals with the details of the journey it has traveled so far and the challenges ahead, commending the commitment of the efforts of the GLP MA (Monitoring Authority) as well as the preparedness of the test facilities. This paper discusses the GLP policy aspects that favoured the growth of the programme among non-member adherents, such as the allowance for getting GLP certification by GLP MA abroad. It also deals with the challenge of harmonizing the policies of the internal agencies that have direct influence on the implementation of the GLP programme, other than legalizing the GLP aspects as there are various government departments in India dealing with the regulatory aspects of specific drug products for human use or that are of chemical in origin. There are data requirements made mandatory by these institutions on pre-clinical or non-clinical safety evaluation of those products, which invariably necessitate studies conducted in compliance with the principles of GLP. The paper concludes with the emphasis that there is a primary need for harmony as well as legal or judicial underpinnings under the umbrella of a national GLP Monitoring Authority, a gray area to be essentially tackled with foresight, to earn credibility on the international front.

The drivers and impacts of technological change have therefore become an important research issue in the field of climate economics. While models to analyze the interactions between economy, energy and the environment initially treated technological change as exogenous, more recent modeling approaches often represent technological change as endogenously induced. Typically, models of induced technological change in climate economics are based on perfect foresight in a deterministic world. However, both technological change and climate impacts are subject to large uncertainties that may substantially affect the design of efficient climate policies. Against this background the Special Issue presents five articles contributing to the study of uncertainty and technological change in climate change economics. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The concept of a real world line of material particles, which has uniform structure in the whole continuum, including the future, is used. A world with foresight that differs from the Minkowski world due to admission of the ability of the observer to observe directly (to foresee) a realization of various events in the future, is researched. The regularities resulting from this admission were researched. It has been proved that there is a certain field of the future, which cannot be observed by such an observer under any circumstances. It has been shown that the actions able to change foresight do not exist or they will not be realized. Upon this foresight of the Future, events can be performed only in such a way and with such a level of accuracy, which do not allow avoidance of the occurrence of the predicted events. It has been proven that foresight of his future cannot be used by the observer for optimization of the strategy of his behavior. © 2009 Physics Essays Publication.","Foresight of the Future; Minkowski World; Prediction of the Future; Space-Time Continuum; The Branch of the Future; World Lines; World with Foresight",,,,,,"Sazanov, A.A., (1988) Four-dimensional Minkowski World, , Science, Moscow; Landau, L.D., Lifshitz, E.M., (1975) The Classical Theory of Fields, , 4th Ed.

This paper examines the potential utility of 'strategic foresight' in considering possible housing futures for Australia. It examines the particular foresight methods employed, and processes used, to develop possible housing futures in the year 2025 and their policy implications. The paper concludes that foresight analysis, although not without its problems, creates the opportunity to move beyond current thinking and 'path dependent' policy parameters, enabling discussion of housing futures in a way that prompts critical discussion of the institutional arrangements and policies that shape housing policy in the present. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology used to build the various scenarios is prospective analysis. We first performed a structural analysis in order to identify the key driving forces that characterize the evolution of the sector in this region (agricultural production, demand for agricultural products and institutional framework). We then carried out a morphological analysis that generated a range of ""partial scenarios"" from which we finally built four ""global scenarios"". These last scenarios characterize the possible trends in the variables of change previously identified. Lastly, the common key parameters of each global scenario were quantified by means of the Delphi method. The characterization of scenarios has a double practical interest. First of all, they can explain the cause-effect relationships of the processes of change that affect agriculture in this region of Spain. Secondly, they are a powerful tool to stimulate an in-depth reflection of how the design and implementation of current agricultural policies will affect the already fragile agricultural sector of Castilla y León. This study thus aims to support decision-making processes at regional level. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

An empirical study aimed to collect information about the varying differences in time and space perspectives among participant individuals (undergraduate and PhD students at Yeditepe University and managers at Siemens-Turkey) and any other possible factors affecting the participants' choices. Two sets of statements are generated representing the time and space perspectives of participants using the modified constructs found in the literature such as ""Time Strata"", ""Space-Time Graph"", and ""Different Time Frames and Activities"". Our sample population of 185 individuals indicated a time horizon of 4.8 years and space horizon of 530 km. Majority of the sample population is observed to be concerned with issues that affect only their close environment over a short time period of ""next week"", along with their larger geographical area as the ""city"". A few of the sample population indicated to have a global perspective on time and space that can further reach into the future. Literature suggesting different individuals having different perspectives on time and space, depending on culture, past experience and the nature of the problems are instrumentalized in our study by relating it to the foresight tools and methodologies. Such varying perspectives may explain individuals/managers' time and space horizon in which they think and act/execute. Based on the analysis of space/time preference of participant individuals, policy makers will benefit from incorporating the diversity of time and space dimensions into their strategic thought and national policy roadmaps. This exploratory study is comprised of the assessment of differing definitions and approaches to the future via individuals' space and time perspectives. It aims to contribute to foresight methodologies and approaches, as well as bringing a significant impact on the quality and success of the national foresight project results. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the jubilee as a case study of the continuing conservative elements after the First World War, this essay argues that jubilee material promoted the idea that certain men had the ability to see the potential of the nation in relation to particular spaces, especially the North. Further, in privileging a specific group of modern men, jubilee organizers argued that this 'sight' echoed the foresight of the Fathers of Confederation. The appeal to men's allegedly innate vision also helped shore up a perceived embattled modern, white, bourgeois masculinity. This article also briefly discusses the impact of this gendering of vision in regard to women's perceived roles in nation-building, particularly in relation to Miss Canada and the underlying ambiguities concerning modernity.","Diamond Jubilee of Confederation; gender; masculinity; Miss Canada; modernity; vision",,,,,,,"Nicholas, J.",,,,,,,,00083755,,,,"English","Can.

The integrated assessment model FUND provides the cost-benefit payoff functions of pollution abatement for sixteen different world regions. The farsighted stability concept of Chwe (1994) is used and solved by combinatorial algorithms. Farsighted stability assumes perfect foresight of the players and predicts which coalitions can be formed when players are farsighted. All farsightedly stable coalitions are found, and their improvement to environment and welfare is considerable. The farsightedly stable coalitions are refined further to preferred farsightedly stable coalitions, which are coalitions where the majority of coalition members reach higher profits in comparison with any other farsightedly stable coalitions. Farsightedly stable coalitions contribute more to the improvement of environment and welfare in comparison to D'Aspremont et al.'s (1983) stable ones. Considering multiple farsighted stable coalitions, participation in coalitions for environmental protection is significantly increased, which is an optimistic result of our game theoretical model. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Barrett, S., Self-enforcing international environmental agreements (1994) Oxford Economic Papers, 46, pp. 878-894; Barrett, S., (2003) Environment and Statecraft: The Strategy of Environmental Treaty-Making, , Oxford.

(1) Quasi-laws in social sciences and futures studies can in fact be treated in the same way that the natural laws of the physical sciences. (2) In order to make predictions, one need not appeal to a strict logical derivation, as the ""covering laws"" doctrine of logical-empiricism suggests. (3) Prediction and explanation are not logically symmetrical as positivists believe, thus the conditions needed for explanation are not those required for prediction. (4) Local, tacit, personal and expert knowledge are crucial in developing a foresight methodology. In conjunction, these four theses open the way to a unique theory of social prediction and to variety of ""unorthodox items of methodological equipment for the purposes of prediction in the inexact sciences."". © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Good agreements between forecasted and actual flow-rates were obtained. The artificial intelligence algorithm uses only two input variables (day of the week and average daily flow-rate of day before) and one output variable (predicted average daily flow-rate). Using three months data for training the network, a long-term forecast (one month) is made with average errors below 10%. Results were compared with those obtained by applying the Census Method II (a commonly used decomposition/recomposition time series method) observing that forecast made by the NFWFFM is more accurate than the one made by this commonly used statistical method. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is no information about the relationship between landscape variables and fishing yield that allows foresight into potential resource exploitation in this environment. The present study aims to evaluate this relationship with the hypothesis: lakes of different shapes give the same fishery yield in the Amazon, after considering the effects of lake size, distance to the river, fishing effort, fuel and ice used. Fishery data from 1994 to 1996 were analyzed with regard to 3228 trips on 50 lakes of the main white water tributaries of the Amazon basin. Analysis of covariance was applied to test this hypothesis. With variables such as fishing grounds access, fishing effort and lake shape the model explained a significant 72% of variabilities in the fisheries yield. Fishing yields among lake systems were different, thus the null hypothesis was rejected (P < 0.05). Results indicate that dendritic lakes far distant from the main river have greater productivity than floodplain lakes because there are more habitats of fish refuge for reproduction and feed available to the fish; there are also more limitations to access by predators. © 2008 Blackwell Verlag.",,,,,,,"Angelini, R., Fabré, N.N., Lopes, U., Trophic analysis and fishing simulation of the biggest amazonian catfish (2006) Afr.

Drivers of increased flood risk were identified and ranked according to their importance in contributing to future flooding by experts and stakeholders working within an inclusive, participatory framework. Management responses to increasing flood risk were also identified and assessed in terms, first, of their potential to reduce flood risks and, second, their sustainability. This analysis provides the foundation for quantitative flood risk modelling to be performed in the next phase of the project. It has also added value to flood risk management in the Taihu Basin by bringing stakeholders together to develop a shared understanding of the flooding system and the relative importance of multiple flood risk drivers and responses. Together, the qualitative and quantitative analyses will provide a comprehensive vision of possible future flood risk to inform policy development and decision making. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","China; Flood risk drivers; Flood risk responses; Future flooding; Risk assessment; Stakeholder participation; Sustainability; Taihu Basin","disaster management; flood damage; flooding; flow modeling; policy development; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; stakeholder; sustainability; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Taihu Basin",,,,,"Arnell, N.W., Chatterton, J., Reducing flood losses (2007) Future Flooding and Coastal Erosion Risks., pp. 360-374. , C.R.

A veterinary professional health care provider, similar to the human medical profession's physician assistant (PA), is one such alternative. To explore this option, this paper provides background information on the development of PAs, including the motivations behind the initiative and the history of the role's development. Rather than aiming for a persuasive appeal, the authors have written this article with the intent of fostering discussion. It Is suggested that perhaps veterinary professional associates, modeled after PAs, could be employed to handle routine veterinary care and thereby allow veterinarians additional time to focus on the more demanding and challenging aspects of veterinary medicine. Perhaps a team approach, similar to the physician/PA team, could help the field of veterinary medicine to better serve both clients and patients. As veterinary medicine directs Its attention toward the new challenges on the horizon, creative solutions will be needed. Perhaps some variation of a veterinary professional associate Is worthy of future discussion. © 2009 AAVMC.","Food animal; Physician assistant; Rural; Shortage; Veterinary professional associate","article; career mobility; decision making; education; human; paramedical personnel; physician assistant; professional standard; United States; veterinary medicine; Animal Technicians; Career Choice; Career Mobility; Education, Veterinary; Humans; Physician Assistants; Professional Role; United States; Veterinarians; Animalia",,,,,"Willis, N.G., Monroe, F.A., Potworowski, J.A., Halbert, G., Evans, B.R., Smith, J.E., Andrews, K.J., Bradbrook, A., Envisioning the future of veterinary medical education: The association of American veterinary medical colleges foresight project, final report (2007) Journal of Veterinary Medical Education, 34 (SUPPL.), pp. 3-25; Jones, P.E., Physician assistant education in the United States (2007) Academic Medicine, 82 (9), pp. 882-887. , DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31812f7c0c, PII 0000188820070900000014; Gifford, J.F., The development of the physician assistant concept (1984) Alternatives in Health Care Delivery: Emerging Roles for Physician Assistants., pp. 4-13. , Carter RD, Perry HB, eds.

In addition, the genetic code is near-optimal in terms of its ability to carry information in addition to the sequences of encoded proteins. As evolution has no foresight, optimality of the modern genetic code suggests that it evolved from less optimal code variants. The length of codons in the genetic code is also optimal, as three is the minimal nucleotide combination that can encode the twenty standard amino acids. The apparent impossibility of transitions between codon sizes in a discontinuous manner during evolution has resulted in an unbending view that the genetic code was always triplet. Yet, recent experimental evidence on quadruplet decoding, as well as the discovery of organisms with ambiguous and dual decoding, suggest that the possibility of the evolution of triplet decoding from living systems with non-triplet decoding merits reconsideration and further exploration. To explore this possibility we designed a mathematical model of the evolution of primitive digital coding systems which can decode nucleotide sequences into protein sequences. These coding systems can evolve their nucleotide sequences via genetic events of Darwinian evolution, such as point-mutations. The replication rates of such coding systems depend on the accuracy of the generated protein sequences. Computer simulations based on our model show that decoding systems with codons of length greater than three spontaneously evolve into predominantly triplet decoding systems. Our findings suggest a plausible scenario for the evolution of the triplet genetic code in a continuous manner. This scenario suggests an explanation of how protein synthesis could be accomplished by means of long RNA-RNA interactions prior to the emergence of the complex decoding machinery, such as the ribosome, that is required for stabilization and discrimination of otherwise weak triplet codon-anticodon interactions. © 2009 Baranov et al.",,"messenger RNA; transfer RNA; accuracy; amino acid sequence; article; codon; computer simulation; genetic code; genetic variability; mathematical model; molecular evolution; nucleotide sequence; point mutation; protein protein interaction; protein synthesis; ribosome; RNA translation; simulation; biological model; genetics; Codon; Computer Simulation; Genetic Code; Models, Genetic; RNA, Messenger",,"transfer RNA, 9014-25-9; Codon; RNA, Messenger",,,"Korostelev, A., Trakhanov, S., Laurberg, M., Noller, H.F., Crystal structure of a 70S ribosome-tRNA complex reveals functional interactions and rearrangements (2006) Cell, 126, pp. 1065-1077; Ogle, J.M., Ramakrishnan, V., Structural insights into translational fidelity (2005) Annu Rev Biochem, 74, pp. 129-177; Korostelev, A., Noller, H.F., The ribosome in focus: New structures bring new insights (2007) Trends Biochem Sci, 32, pp. 434-441; Ramakrishnan, V., What we have learned from ribosome structures (2008) Biochem Soc Trans, 36, pp. 567-574; Selmer, M., Dunham, C.M., Murphy, F.V., Weixlbaumer, A., Petry, S., Structure of the 70S ribosome complexed with mRNA and tRNA (2006) Science, 313, pp. 1935-1942; Steitz, T.A., Moore, P.B., RNA, the first macromolecular catalyst: The ribosome is a ribozyme (2003) Trends Biochem Sci, 28, pp. 411-418; Steitz, T.A., A structural understanding of the dynamic ribosome machine (2008) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 9, pp. 242-253; Cech, T.R., Structural biology.

Instead, it is argued that the emerging business environment now demands a new set of leadership skills that are aligned to the requirements of the future. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A foresight orientation was taken to identify leadership skills necessary for success in the near future. Based on in-depth analysis of key business, societal, organisational and leadership trends, nine key leadership competencies were identified. An exploratory study was then conducted to assess the current level of future leadership capability in a diverse sample included of current and emerging leaders from a variety of organisations across Europe and Asia Pacific. Findings: Results suggest that both current and emerging organisational leaders are significantly under prepared for the challenges ahead. Research limitations/implications: The present study provides a starting-point for further research exploring the leadership capabilities needed for success in the emerging business environment. Practical implications: It is argued that unless organisations begin to cultivate requisite skills for the future, they will inevitably forfeit their potential for future success. Originality/value: The paper adds clear value to the field of study due to its unique futures perspective and orientation, in addition to its practical applications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Demographics; Globalization; Human resource management; Leadership; Strategic management",,,,,,"Albrecht, K., The Creative Corporation (1987), Dow Jones-Irwin, New York, NY; Avolio, B.J., Gardner, W.L., Authentic leadership development: Getting to the root of positive forms of leadership (2005) The Leadership Quarterly, 16 (3), pp. 315-38; Barsh, J., Innovative management: A conversation with Gary Hamel and Lowell Bryan (2008) The McKinsey Quarterly, pp. 1-10. , February 15; Bonini, S.M.J., McKillop, K., Mendonca, L.T., What consumers expect from companies (2007) The McKinsey Quarterly, (2), pp. 11-17; Bower, J., Solve the succession crisis by growing inside-outside leaders (2007) Harvard Business Review, 85 (11), pp. 90-6; Cetron, M.J., Davies, O., Trends shaping the future: Technological, workplace, management, and institutional trends (2003) The Futurist, 37 (2), pp. 30-43. , World Future Society; Choi, M., Individual and contextual predictors of creative performance: The mediating role of psychological processes (2004) Creativity Research Journal, 16 (2), pp. 183-7; Cornish, E., Futuring: The exploration of the future (2004) The Futurist, , March/April; Dane, E.I., Pratt, M.G., Exploring intuition and its role in managerial decision-making (2007) Academy of Management Review, 32 (1), pp. 33-54; Florida, R., (2002) Rise of the Creative Lass, , Wiley, New York, NY; Friedman, T., (2006) The World is Flat, , Penguin Group, London; George, B., (2003) Authentic Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, CA; Gordon, T.J., Trend impact analysis (1994) Futures Research Methodology, pp. 331-57. , in Jerome, C.G.

Design/methodology/approach - The project used an integral meta-scanning framework to review publicly available futures material. The framework categorizes futures work according to organizational type, social interests, methods, domains and geographic location (details of the methodology are outlined in the accompanying introductory paper as well as on the web site created for the project). Findings - The futures field has made a series of significant contributions to understanding the global problematique and has contributed to the pre-conditions for its resolution. However, the bulk of mainstream futures work does little to improve the preparedness of humanity for looming future crises. More innovative futures work remains marginalized and largely ignored by the powerful and the wider public. There is a strong case for more effective political engagement than has occurred hitherto. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed on shared definitions for the field, interactions with the media, public and other fields of enquiry and action, measurement of individual foresight capacity, strategies for achieving influence - particularly in the political sphere, the role of subcultures within the futures field and suitable publishing strategies. Practical implications - The paper recommends specific actions to promote and publicize good work, provide annual digests of futures-related information, develop and use focused briefings, provide support for ""cutting-edge"" futures work, further develop advanced futures methods, create new alliances, build the social capacity for foresight and strengthen the nexus between foresight and philanthropy. Originality/value - The paper uses an integral meta-scanning framework to provide a novel analysis of the futures field. The findings will be of value to all futures and foresight practitioners that are interested in the future success of the field. © Richard A.

The key element of our approach, the so-called variation analysis, is a methodology to identify coherent socio-technical and organizational variants within a specific innovation field. Consistent combinations of these two dimensions may be interpreted as nuclei for alternative future developments of innovation systems. The method may be used in discursive foresight processes to inform strategy formulation of firms or policy makers who see a utility in furthering the innovation field.

It is essential to look at the means available, in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the construction industry. Technology fusion, which refers to a truly interdisciplinary approach of combining different technology areas, is a new way of sparking off the currently stagnant level of construction technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive technology roadmap developed under the support of Korea Ministry of Construction and Transportation (KMOCT), where the needs for innovative future construction technology are well organized through the interdisciplinary research efforts. To succeed in developing a technology fusion-based construction research plan, four major approaches are adopted: technology foresight, socio-economic prediction, market needs identification, and benchmarking of other efforts. Through these integrated processes, research and development (R&D) programs that cover the entire life cycle of construction projects are proposed. KMOCT is expected to launch 14 of the proposed programs during the next five years on a priority base, funding a total of approximately US$ 5 to 15 million for each program. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The SOPIFF project used an integral meta-scanning framework to review publicly available futures material, providing a rich source of material to use in assessing the influence achieved by futures work. The framework categorizes futures work according to organizational type, social interests, methods, domains and geographic location. Findings - On the whole, the influence achieved by futures work is disappointing given that many futurists are strongly committed to bringing about more desirable futures. Some qualified success stories include science and technology foresight, getting sustainability challenges onto the social agenda and small-scale, distributed initiatives. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the scanning process include heavy reliance on publicly available material, prioritization of breadth over depth of analysis and the physical and cultural location of the researchers. Future iterations of the research should go beyond public material, undertake deeper analysis of scanning hits and draw in more non-western and non-English work. Practical implications - The paper proposes four strategies for increasing the influence of futures work: methodological renewal, political engagement, individual capacity building and participatory approaches. Originality/value - The paper uses the recently developed integral meta-scanning framework to provide a novel view of the futures field. The findings will be of value to foresight practitioners that are seeking to influence public policy and sustainability. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forward planning; Influence; Public policy; Sustainable development",,,,,,"Agrawala, S., Structural and process history of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (1998) Climatic Change, 39 (4), pp. 621-42; Calof, J., Tanguay, D., Spring, L., (2006) Addressing Canada's Foresight Capacity: A Report to the National Science Advisor, , Science and Technology Foresight Directorate, Office of the National Science Advisor, Government of Canada, Ottawa, 15 September; Cameron, H., Georghiou, L., Keenan, M., Miles, I., Saritas, O., (2006) Evaluation of the United Kingdom Foresight Programme: Final Report, , PREST, Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, Manchester, March; Carson, R., (1962) Silent Spring, , Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA; Dreborg, K.H., Essence of backcasting (1996) Futures, 28 (9), pp. 813-28; Dryzek, J.S., Downes, D., Hunold, C., Schlosberg, D., Hernes, H.-K., (2003) Green States and Social Movements: Environmentalism in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Norway, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Glenn, J.C., Gordon, T.J., Dator, J., Closing the deal: How to make organizations act on futures research (2001) Foresight, 3 (3), pp. 177-89; Hayward, P., Resolving the moral impediments to foresight action (2003) Foresight, 5 (1), pp. 4-10; Inayatullah, S., Causal layered analysis: Poststructuralism as method (1998) Futures, 30 (8), pp. 815-29; Inayatullah, S., Layered methodology: Meanings, epistemes and the politics of knowledge (2002) Futures, 34 (6), pp. 479-91; (2005) The 2029 Project: Achieving an Ethical Future in Biomedical R&D, , Institute for Alternative Futures, Institute for Alternative Futures, Alexandria, VA; Kapoor, R., Future as fantasy: Forgetting the flaws (2001) Futures, 33, pp. 161-70; Kapoor, R., Auroville: A spiritual-social experiment in human unity and evolution (2007) Futures, 39 (5), pp. 632-43; Kapoor, R., Transforming self and society: Plural paths to human emancipation (2007) Futures, 39 (5), pp. 475-86; Kates, R., Leiserowitz, A., Parris, T., (2006) Great Transition Values: Present Attitudes, Future Changes, , GTI Paper Series: Frontiers of a Great Transition, Paper No. 9, Tellus Institute, Boston, MA; Kriegman, O., (2006) Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement, , GTI Paper Series: Frontiers of a Great Transition, Paper No. 15, Tellus Institute, Boston, MA; Meadows, D.H., Meadows, D.L., Randers, J., Behrens, W.W., (1972) The Limits to Growth, , Universe, New York, NY; Miles, I., Keenan, M., Two and a half cycles of foresight in the UK (2003) Technikfolgenabschatzung - Theorie und Praxis, 2 (12), pp. 41-9; Ramos, J.M., (2004) Foresight Practice in Australia: A Meta-scan of Practitioners and Organisations, , Australian Foresight Institute, Melbourne; Raskin, P.D., (2006) The Great Transition Today: A Report from the Future, , GTI Paper Series: Frontiers of a Great Transition, Paper No. 2, Tellus Institute, Boston, MA; Raskin, P.D., (2006) World Lines: Pathways, Pivots and the Global Future, , GTI Paper Series: Frontiers of a Great Transition, Paper No. 16, Tellus Institute, Boston, MA; Raskin, P., Banuri, T., Gallopin, G., Gutman, P., Hammond, A., Kates, R., Swart, R., (2002) Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead, , Stockholm Environment Institute, Boston, MA; Rejeski, D., Olson, R.L., Has futurism failed?

One argument is that the scenario team and managers should consider all the scenarios as equally likely and to prepare for each scenario. In addition, the strategic purpose of scenarios is to think of alternative futures and get away from financial and other types of time-series trend forecasts. On the other hand, there is a counter-argument that says that probabilities can and should be used with scenarios. These probabilities, however, are Bayesian in that they explicitly include assumptions, imagination, and expert judgment and that they go beyond trend projections.

The purely feedback-driven CBA strategy has been contrasted with the strategy of predicting the eventual time and location of the future interception point. This study considers an intermediate anticipatory strategy of moving so as to produce a CBA a short duration into the future. Subjects controlled their speed of self-motion along a linear path through a simulated environment to intercept a moving target. When targets changed speed midway through the trial in Experiment 1, subjects abandoned an ineffective CBA strategy in favor of a strategy of anticipating the most likely change in target speed. In Experiment 2, targets followed paths of varying curvature. Behavior was inconsistent with both the CBA and the purely predictive strategy. To investigate the intermediate anticipatory strategy, human performance was compared with a model of interceptive behavior that, at each time-step t, produced the velocity adjustment that would minimize the change in bearing angle at time t + Δt, taking into account the target's behavior during that interval. Values of Δt at which the model best fit the human data for practiced subjects varied between 0.5 and 3.5 s, suggesting that actors adopt an anticipatory strategy to keep the bearing angle constant a short time into the future. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Anticipation; Interception; Locomotion; Visual control","article; human; locomotion; normal human; priority journal; stimulus; task performance; vision; Analysis of Variance; Computer Simulation; Humans; Models, Psychological; Motion Perception; Motor Skills; Task Performance and Analysis",,,,,"Bastin, J., Montagne, G., The perceptual support of goal-directed displacement is context-dependent (2005) Neuroscience Letters, 376 (2), pp. 121-126. , DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2004.11.040; Bastin, J., Craig, C., Montagne, G., Prospective strategies underlie the control of interceptive actions (2006) Human Movement Science, 25 (6), pp. 718-732. , DOI 10.1016/j.humov.2006.04.001, PII S0167945706000327; Chapman, S., Catching a baseball (1968) Am J Phys, 36, pp. 368-370; Chardenon, A., Montagne, G., Laurent, M., Bootsma, R.J., A robust solution for dealing with environmental changes in intercepting moving balls (2005) Journal of Motor Behavior, 37 (1), pp. 52-64. , DOI 10.3200/JMBR.37.1.52-62; Cutting, J.E., Vishton, P.M., Braren, P.A., How we avoid collisions with stationary and moving obstacles (1995) Psychol Rev, 102, pp. 627-651; De Lussanet, M.H.E., Smeets, J.B.J., Brenner, E., The effect of expectations on hitting moving targets: Influence of the preceding target's speed (2001) Experimental Brain Research, 137 (2), pp. 246-248. , DOI 10.1007/s002210000607; De Lussanet, M.H.E., Smeets, J.B.J., Brenner, E., The relation between task history and movement strategy (2002) Behavioural Brain Research, 129 (1-2), pp. 51-59. , DOI 10.1016/S0166-4328(01)00320-5, PII S0166432801003205; Fajen, B.R., Warren, W.H., Visual guidance of intercepting a moving target on foot (2004) Perception, 33 (6), pp. 689-715. , DOI 10.1068/p5236; Fajen, B.R., Warren, W.H., Behavioral dynamics of intercepting a moving target (2007) Experimental Brain Research, 180 (2), pp. 303-319. , DOI 10.1007/s00221-007-0859-6; Jordan, M.I., Wolpert, D.M., Gazzagina, M., Computational motor control (1999) The Cognitive Neurosciences, pp. 601-620. , MIT Press Cambridge, MA; Lanchester, B.S., Mark, R.F., Pursuit and prediction in the tracking of moving food by a teleost fish (Acanthaluteres spilomelanurus) (1975) J Exp Biol, 63, pp. 627-645; Le Brun, D., (2002) Nouveau Manuel du Marin [New Seaman's Manual], , Solar, Paris, France; Lenoir, M., Musch, E., Janssens, M., Thiery, E., Uyttenhove, J., Intercepting moving objects during self-motion (1999) Journal of Motor Behavior, 31 (1), pp. 55-67; Lenoir, M., Savelsbergh, G.J., Musch, E., Thiery, E., Uyttenhove, J., Janssens, M., Intercepting moving objects during self-motion: Effects of environmental changes (1999) Res Q Exerc Sport, 70, pp. 349-360; Lenoir, M., Musch, E., Thiery, E., Savelsbergh, G.J.P., Rate of change of angular bearing as the relevant property in a horizontal interception task during locomotion (2002) Journal of Motor Behavior, 34 (4), pp. 385-401; McLeod, P., Reed, N., Dienes, Z., The generalized optic acceleration cancellation theory of catching (2006) J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform, 32, pp. 139-148; Montagne, G., Prospective control in sport (2005) International Journal of Sport Psychology, 36 (2), pp. 127-150; Olberg, R.M., Worthington, A.H., Venator, K.R., Prey pursuit and interception in dragonflies (2000) Journal of Comparative Physiology - A Sensory, Neural, and Behavioral Physiology, 186 (2), pp. 155-162; Warren Jr., W.H., Visually Controlled Locomotion: 40 Years Later (1998) Ecological Psychology, 10 (3-4), pp. 177-219","Diaz, G.

This paper, Part I, also aims to focus on the upper quadrants of the IF framework. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adapts Wilber's integral theory to clarify various philosophical orientations towards the future. It also adapts Polak's approach to futures as a matter of ""social critique and reconstruction""; however, here the approach is global, civilizational, and integral, so it proposes civilizational critique and integral reconstruction as a method for evaluating futures schools of thought. Findings - The IF framework has proved to be a valuable theoretical and analytical tool since it clarifies not only orientations to the future but also demonstrates the dynamic lines of development and interactions throughout all four quadrants, illustrating how the four-quadrant approach is an effective framework for understanding the crisis of civilization and the response needed at this time in history to bring about a preferred future. Research implications/limitations - The paper draws and expands upon the findings of the SOPIFF project as a way to better understand the ""global problematique."" Thus, this paper suggests some implications of that research and proposes the integral futures framework as a way to interpret research findings. Future research should attempt to develop and apply the IF framework similarly in order to realize a sustainable, integrally-informed image of the future of human civilization. Practical implications - An integrally-informed approach to futures and foresight studies should help develop and improve futures methodology/practices in general. The IF framework helps to understand philosophical orientations underlying practices and applications. Originality/value - This application of the IF framework to various mainstream futures schools of thought is original. It should help futurists to see and interpret the bigger picture regarding images of the future in a civilizational context by revealing the ""crack"" in the modern image of the future, how it relates to the current world crisis, and what is needed to heal the crack so that a new, more integrally-informed, sustainable image of the future can emerge. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Branches of philosophy; Forward planning; Social problems",,,,,,"Capra, F., (1999) The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism, , 25th Anniversary ed., Shambhala Publications Inc., Boston, MA; Collins, S.G., (2008) All Tomorrow's Cultures: Anthropological Engagements with the Future, , Berghan Books, New York, NY; Fukuyama, F., (1992) The End of History and the Last Man, , Avon Books, New York, NY; Jaynes, J., (1990) The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, , Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA; Jensen, D., (2006) Endgame: The Problem of Civilization, , Seven Stories Press, New York, NY; Korten, K., (2006) The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community, , Berrett-Koehler Publishers, San Francisco, CA; Lennon, J., How?

The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) provides a common metric for comparing interventions over multiple dimensions of HRQoL and mortality differentials. There are, however, many circumstances when - because of timing, lack of foresight or cost considerations - only stroke-specific or descriptive measures of health status are available and some indirect means of obtaining QALY-weights becomes necessary. In such circumstances, the use of regression-based transformations or mappings can circumvent the failure to elicit QALY-weights by allowing predicted weights to proxy for observed weights. This regression-based approach has been dubbed 'Transfer to Utility' (TTU) regression. The purpose of the present study is to demonstrate the feasibility and value of TTU regression in stroke by deriving transformations or mappings from stroke-specific and generic but descriptive measures of health status to a generic preference-based measure of HRQoL in a sample of Australians with a diagnosis of acute stroke. Findings will quantify the additional error associated with the use of condition-specific to generic transformations in stroke. Methods: We used TTU regression to derive empirical transformations from three commonly used descriptive measures of health status for stroke (NIHSS, Barthel and SF-36) to a preference-based measure (AQoL) suitable for attaching QALY-weights to stroke disease states; based on 2570 observations drawn from a sample of 859 patients with stroke. Results: Transformations from the SF-36 to the AQoL explained up to 71.5% of variation in observed AQoL scores. Differences between mean predicted and mean observed AQoL scores from the 'severity-specific' item- and subscale-based SF-36 algorithms and from the 'moderate to severe' index- and item-based Barthel algorithm were neither clinically nor statistically significant when 'low severity' SF-36 transformations were used to predict AQoL scores for patients in the NIHSS = 0 and NIHSS = 1-5 subgroups and when 'moderate to severe severity' transformations were used to predict AQoL scores for patients in the NIHSS ≥ 6 subgroup. In contrast, the difference between mean predicted and mean observed AQoL scores from the NIHSS algorithms and from the 'low severity' Barthel algorithms reached levels that could mask minimally important differences on the AQoL scale. Conclusion: While our NIHSS to AQoL transformations proved unsuitable for most applications, our findings demonstrate that stroke-relevant outcome measures such as the SF-36 and Barthel Index can be adequately transformed to preference-based measures for the purposes of economic evaluation. © 2009 Mortimer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"aged; article; Australia; Barthel index; controlled study; disease severity; economic evaluation; feasibility study; female; health status; human; major clinical study; male; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; outcome assessment; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; regression analysis; Short Form 36; statistical analysis; stroke; transfer to utility analysis; health status; methodology; middle aged; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; quality of life; questionnaire; regression analysis; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Questionnaires; Regression Analysis; Stroke; Victoria",,,,,"Richardson, J., Cost utility analysis: What should be measured?

Design/methodology/approach: Technology innovation management is strictly related to the RUL. The RUL concept is defined as the time remaining until the reliability drops below a defined minimal operating threshold. The RUL analysis of certain intangible assets (patents and know-how licence agreements, industrial designs, trade marks, logos, customer base) is done through different methodologies and various different approaches. The key subject in all these methodologies is the life cycle of the technology. The analyst tries to approach the foresight of the life cycle of technology to establish its value in use. Different life measure systems are considered in RUL analysis depending on different typologies of technology life: statutory, contract, judicial, economic and functional. Data used in life cycle estimation may be used in RUL analysis. Typically, these data include scientific articles, registration documents (patent applications, trade marks and copyright applications), commercial contracts, judicial orders, financial statements and technology data. Findings: The analysis of the life cycle allows the incorporation of qualitative considerations (legal, contractual, physical, technical know-how, functional, economic) related to the conduct of future technologies. But technology development is conditioned by trends in scientific research and by the changes in the marketing dynamic, today and in the future. Qualitative methods provide a valuable information service that relates to the intangible assets over time. The ""typical survivor curve"" shows the released, remaining and probable life span of a certain technology by taking into account factors such as technological changes, marketing acceptance, and other exogenous and endogenous factors. Quantitative analysis of scientific production, applications for patents, industrial designs and trade marks, developed in scientometrics and bibliometrics, provide an unbiased guide to R&D and business trends. Originality/value: The original purpose of the paper is to emphasise how the technology life cycle is influenced by changes in technology but also in scientific research evolution. Scientific research life analysis must examine the historical emergence or decay of a certain intellectual interest in the scientific community through the study of what is and what is not published in scientific journals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Intangible assets; Patents; Product life cycle","Design/methodology/approach; Intangible assets; Patents; Product life cycles; Remaining useful lives; Technology development; Technology innovation; Technology life cycle; Commerce; Information services; Life cycle; Marketing; Patents and inventions; Research; Technology transfer; Trademarks; Economic analysis",,,,,"Adams, J., Gurney, K., Jackson, L., Calibrating the zoom: A test of Zitt's hypothesis (2008) Scientometrics, 75 (1), p. 81; Chavalarias, D., Cointet, J.P., Bottom-up scientific field detection for dynamical and hierarchical science mapping, methodology and case study (2008) Scientometrics, 75 (1), p. 37; (1997) Second European Report on Science and Technology Indicators, p. 111. , Commission of the European Communities, Directorate General for Science Research and Development, EUR17639, EC, Luxembourg, December; (2008), urlwww.fasb.org/, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), available at:; Flignor, P., Orozco, D., (2006) Intangible Asset and Intellectual Property Valuation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective, , www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/ip_valuation.htm#author2, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Geneva, available at:; Gupta, B.M., Dhawan, S.M., Condensed matter physics: An analysis of India's research output, 1993-2001 (2008) Scientometrics, 75 (1), p. 123; Huang, Y., Zhao, X., Trends of DDT research during the period of 1991 to 2005 (2008) Scientometrics, 75 (1), p. 111; Huang, Y., Ao, X., Ho, Y.-S., Use of citation per publication as an indicator to evaluate pentachlorophenol research (2008) Scientometrics, 75 (1), p. 67; (2008) International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), , www.iasb.org/IFRS+Summaries/Technical+Summaries+of+International+Financial+Reporting+Standards.htm, International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), available at:; Lundqvist, P., Marton, J., (2006) Applying IFRS 3 in Accounting for Business Acquisitions: A Case Study, , https://gupea.ub.gu.se/dspace/bitstream/2077/3127/1/06-07-28M.pdf, Master's thesis, School of Business Economics and Law, Göteborg University, Göteborg, available at:; Miguel, S., Moya-Anegón, F., Herrero-Solana, V., A new approach to institutional domain analysis: Multilevel research fronts structure (2008) Scientometrics, 74 (3), p. 331; Norman, D.A., (1998) The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is so Complex, and Information Appliances Are the Solution, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Ostrom, J.C., The worth of a thing is the price it will bring ...

However, foresight, future outlooks and scenarios are, as a rule, based on inductivist or deductivist methods, making looking into the future a form of conservative projecting of past and present probabilities onto the road of development lying ahead of us. Closed past or present outlooks give birth to open futures, but these futures usually are little more than exercises in organizational learning. In this paper we present and develop a method for futures research that is based on abductive logic. Abduction-based futures research approach proceeds from closed, imaginary future states to alternative, open theoretical frameworks or explanations. Unlike inductivists and deductivists believe, this procedure from the unknown to the known is rational, and therefore something that can be systematized and learned. There is a logic of discovery, and what could be a better place to apply and develop it than futures research. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Limits are traditionally analysed as a set of immutable thresholds in biological, economic or technological parameters. This paper contends that limits to adaptation are endogenous to society and hence contingent on ethics, knowledge, attitudes to risk and culture. We review insights from history, sociology and psychology of risk, economics and political science to develop four propositions concerning limits to adaptation. First, any limits to adaptation depend on the ultimate goals of adaptation underpinned by diverse values. Second, adaptation need not be limited by uncertainty around future foresight of risk. Third, social and individual factors limit adaptation action. Fourth, systematic undervaluation of loss of places and culture disguises real, experienced but subjective limits to adaptation. We conclude that these issues of values and ethics, risk, knowledge and culture construct societal limits to adaptation, but that these limits are mutable. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Social sciences; Adaptation needs; Climatic conditions; Individual factors; Political science; Technological parameters; Climate change; climate change; climate conditions; culture; environmental factor; ethics; social behavior",,,,,"Adger, W.N., Barnett, J., Ellemor, H., (2009); Agrawala, S., Fankhauser, S., (2008), OECD Paris; Apuuli, B., Wright, J., Elias, C., Burton, I., Reconciling national and global priorities in adaptation to climate change: With an illustration from Uganda (2000) Environ Monit Assess, 61, pp. 145-159; Arnell, N.W., Delaney, E.K., Adapting to climate change: Water supply in England and Wales (2006) Clim Change, 78, pp. 227-255; Baer, P., The worth of an ice-sheet: A critique of the treatment of catastrophic impacts in the Stern review (2007) EcoEquity Discussion Paper, , www.ecoequity.org/docs/WorthOfAnIceSheet.pdf, Accessed 18 January 2007; Baker, A.R.H., (1992); Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychol Rev, 84, pp. 191-215; Berkes, F., (2002); Berkhout, F., Hertin, J., Gann, D.M., Learning to adapt: Organisational adaptation to climate change impacts (2006) Clim Change, 78, pp. 135-156; Berman, M., Kofinas, G., Hunting for models: Grounded and rational choice approaches to analyzing climate effects on subsistence hunting in an Arctic community (2004) Ecol Econ, 49, pp. 31-46; Burton, I., Kates, R.W., White, G.F., (1993), 2 Guilford New York; Camfield, L., McGregor, A., (2005); Cash, D.W., Clark, W.C., Alcock, F., Dickson, N.M., Eckley, N., Guston, D.H., Jager, J., Mitchell, R.B., Knowledge systems for sustainable development (2003) PNAS, 100, pp. 8086-8091; Cash, D.W., Adger, W.N., Berkes, F., Garden, P., Lebel, L., Olsson, P., Pritchard, L., Young, O., Scale and cross-scale dynamics: Governance and information in a multi-level world (2006) Ecology and Society, 11 (2), p. 8. , http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol11/iss2/art8/; Cruikshank, J., Glaciers and climate change: Perspectives from oral tradition (2001) Arctic, 54, pp. 377-393; Dessai, S., Hulme, M., Does climate adaptation policy need probabilities?

In this paper, various existing methods and procedures which can be used for early identification of safety issues are reviewed, including the monitoring of the occurrence of specific hazards within the food supply, or the incidences of food-borne diseases, as well as the combination of these data with other data or with expert opinions. Some methods, including hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP), operate pro-actively by pre-defining indicators for hazards and follow-up measures. Vulnerability assessment focuses on potential weak spots within the food supply, whilst futures research employs foresight to enhance preparedness for future hazards and risks. A Delphi survey on food safety risk analysis conducted among professionals revealed concerns with various aspects of current procedures for dealing with emerging issues, and these are discussed. The Delphi respondents also attached great value to the involvement of stakeholders and the inclusion of a broader range of data into risk analysis. Indeed, holistic systems employing indicators from outside the food production chain are now being developed. In conclusion, a four-step procedure for the early identification of emerging issues is proposed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The discoveries of organic chemistry made the synthesis of new products possible (dyes, medicines etc.), electricity supplies in towns and cities were bringing lighting and the beginnings of a certain comfort (at the time of the Paris Universal Exposition in 1900, electricity was seen as an animating sprite: ""la fée électricité""), the automobile was making its appearance, and the telegraph and telephone were about to provide means of very long-distance communication. In the decades preceding the First World War, the development of education and universities in France would be a major aim of the Third Republic, with the aim of both consolidating Republican authority and remedying France's scientific backwardness by comparison with Germany. This capacity of science and technology to promote human happiness was often a central theme at the Republican banquets so beloved of the Republic's leading personalities. The chemist Marcelin Berthelot, an academic widely recognized for his scientific work and an influential figure who combined the roles of scientist and politician - roles which, a few short years later, Max Weber would show to be guided by contrasting ethical imperatives - was no exception to this tradition. In this address on the subject of the year 2000, which he delivered at the banquet of the French Employers' Federation for the Chemical Industries in 1894, Berthelot engaged in a brief foresight exercise. He speaks of his faith in a future that was being fashioned by the discoveries of science - and, in particular, of chemistryand by ""the alliance between science and industry"" (this is a theme that will be heard once again, in virtually the same tones, more than a century later) - an alliance which was largely realized in Germany at the time, as is often forgotten. This speech, as can be seen here, is a genuine programme for the future, couched in highly optimistic terms.",,,,,,,"Voir aussi le futur d'antan de Marcelin Berthelot, « Les matières explosives », publié dans Futuribles, no 321, juillet-août 2006, pp. 113-116 (NDLR); Lire « source d'énergie calorifique » selon l'édition de 1909",,,,,,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

The planning actions, which took place in a calm state, included stone caching and the manufacture of discs from concrete, objects later used as missiles against zoo visitors during agitated chimpanzee dominance displays. Such planning implies advanced consciousness and cognition traditionally not associated with nonhuman animals [1]. Spontaneous and unambiguous planning behaviours for future states by non-humans have not previously been reported, and anecdotal reports, describing single occasions, are exceptionally scarce [2-4]. This dearth of observations is arguably the main reason for not ascribing cognitive foresight to nonhuman animals [1]. To date, the surprisingly few controlled demonstrations of planning for future states by animals are experimentally induced behaviours in great apes [5-7] and corvids [8,9]. The observational findings in this report suggest that these laboratory results are not experimental artefacts, at least in the case of great apes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We draw on a body of social theory concerned with the way that meaning is produced and assimilated by society; specifically, the social construction of knowledge, which is distinguished from its near-neighbour constructivism by its focus on inter-subjectivity. We show that social constructionism, at least in its weak form, seems to be implicit in many epistemological assumptions underlying futures studies. We identify a range of distinctive methodological features in foresight studies, such as time, descriptions of difference, participation and values, and examine these from a social constructionist perspective. It appears that social constructionism is highly resonant with the way in which knowledge of the future is produced and used. A social constructionism perspective enables a methodological reflection on how, with what legitimacy, and to what social good, knowledge is produced. Foresight that produces symbols without inter-subjective meaning neither anticipates, nor produces futures. Our conclusion is that foresight is both a social construction, and a mechanism for social construction. Methodologically, foresight projects should acknowledge the socially constructed nature of their process and outcomes as this will lead to greater rigour and legitimacy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This task becomes especially vital in view of the current situation on global energy markets. The planning of technological development in the energy and fuel sectors is a relevant element of energy security strategies. This in turn leads to a more rational and efficient energy use in the future. Technology foresight, which emerged as a proven instrument of technology policy during the 1950s, becomes nowadays one of the essential tools for the creation of the future technological development worldwide. A project entitled: ""The Scenarios of Technological Development of Fuel and Energy Sector for National Energy Security"" was the first foresight project in the field of energy technologies and at the same time the first technology foresight activity in Poland. This project was being carried out in the period of 2006-2007 by a consortium of research and development institutes on the request of the Polish Ministry of Economy. The aim of the project was to indicate energy and fuel sector development directions in the time horizon up to 2030 and identify key energy technologies of strategic importance. As a result of the foresight activity, technology development scenarios in the energy and fuel sector in Poland as well as corresponding roadmaps for their implementation were formulated. The project results should be helpful in drafting national energy policies and they will indicate priority pathways of research and development (R&D) activities in the next years. The energy foresight project was based mainly on a Delphi method that is nowadays widely applied as a valuable foresight tool. This future-oriented intuitive method was engaged for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of probable developments in the future and for their time scale evaluation as well. In this article, the results of the conducted two-round Delphi survey were presented. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Background Many high-reliability industries formally train staff in prospective risk analysis. Although there are tools to retrospectively analyse incidents in healthcare and although many staff are error aware there is no training to formalize this learning. Key issues Staff already use error awareness and often intervene to prevent patient harm resulting in many 'no harm' incidents. The National Patient Safety Agency has developed the foresight training package to broaden healthcare professionals' understanding of the many factors that can combine to contribute to an incident occurring, and to encourage shared learning. For management teams, this broader understanding will assist them in prospective risk assessment of the staff they manage enabling them to be proactive in minimizing risk. The training tool is based on Reason's 'three bucket' model. Evaluation Throughout every stage in the development of the foresight training package the concept and materials were tested with front-line staff. Formal evaluation of the published package is due to be completed by May 2009. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Foresight; Human error; Human factors; Nursing management; Patient safety; Risk; System failure","article; bioengineering; education; human; in service training; medical error; methodology; nursing staff; organization and management; pilot study; risk assessment; risk management; system analysis; teaching; United Kingdom; Great Britain; Human Engineering; Humans; Inservice Training; Medical Errors; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Pilot Projects; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Systems Analysis; Teaching Materials",,,,,"Carthey, J., De Leval, M.R., Reason, J.T., The 'human factor' in cardiac surgery: Errors and near misses in a high technology medical domain (2001) Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 72, pp. 300-305; Carthey, J., De Leval, M.R., Reason, J.T., Farewell, V.T., Wright, D.J., Human factors research in cardiac surgery: Opportunities and pitfalls (2001) Clinical Risk, 7, pp. 85-90; Carthey, J., De Leval, M.R., Wright, D.J., Farewell, V.T., Reason, J.T., Behavioural markers of surgical excellence (2003) Safety Science, 41, pp. 409-413; Flin, R., Fletcher, G., McGeorge, P., Sutherland, A., Patey, R., Anaesthetists attitudes to teamwork and safety (2003) Anaesthesia, 58, pp. 233-242; Hopkins, A., (2002) Safety, Culture, Mindfulness and Safe Behaviour: Converging Ideas., , http://www.ohs.anu.edu.au/publications/pdf/wp%207%20-%20Hopkins.pdf, Working paper 7.

The SST approach seems especially promising in areas of technology where visions are manifold, societal interests conflicting, and applications and markets are non-existing or still under construction. The emerging high technology areas and several areas of more sustainable development like organic food production and renewable energy are examples of this kind, where techno-economic networks are unstable or under construction and social and environmental potentials and risks difficult, if not impossible to assess. The paper explores the potential of a social shaping of technology approach to technology foresight within such technology areas and presents the methodological aspects herein: structure versus contingency, actor-network approach, laboratory programmes, techno-economic networks, actor worlds, development arenas. Experiences based on a recent Danish green technology foresight project concerned with environmental risks and opportunities related to nano-, bio- and ICT-technologies and foresight activities in relation to food are used as empirical references. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Modal narratives concern themselves with contingency and determinism: with questions of possibility and necessity. While scenarios are future-oriented, focused on what might yet be, counterfactuals are narratives of what might have been. Despite this fundamental temporal difference, consideration of the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of modal narratives as a genre enables us to elucidate some critical issues concerning scenarios as a foresight methodology. In particular, the scenario literature has tended to avoid extended discussion of its implicit assumptions concerning causation, necessity, possibility and contingency. By confronting the modal nature of foresight methodologies more explicitly, the futures community may begin to lay more secure philosophical foundations for their deployment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This was the ""STS Perspectives"" project. Nearly six years later, that project has become an essential pillar in the thinking on the future of science and technology in Quebec, connecting closely, on the one hand, with the aspirations of the citizens and, on the other, with the researchers and public decisionmakers. In this article, Alain Bergeron, who until 2008 co-ordinated the project, outlines this demand-led scientific and technological foresight exercise in detail. After recalling how ""STS Perspectives"" originated, he gives an account of the two major phases of the project. The first task was to determine the main socio-economic challenges that science and technology can contribute to meeting, first questioning the Quebec population on its future concerns, then tightening the analysis by consulting researchers. In the second phase, working groups made up both of researchers and ""research users"" devised research development strategies for each of the challenges identified. Lastly, Alain Bergeron demonstrates the advantages of this approach and how it has been - or is being translated into public policies in Quebec.",,,,,,,"Voir TREMBLAY Hélène P., BERGERON Alain. « La fonction de conseil en science et technologie.

In a world where research, scientific knowledge and technological change are of such importance, it is essential to develop public policies that are in phase, in these fields, with the expectations of society and with general future developmental trends. Agora 2020, which aims to stimulate a constructive dialogue between researchers, social actors and public research policy officials, is a vast foresight consultation exercise (with more than 700 people consulted between 2004 and 2007). It has thrown up a large number of - sometimes novel - questions and concrete orientations for future scientific policies in the period to 2020/30 that are destined to feed into research strategies in fields such as urbanism, transport, housing, territorial administration, the vulnerability of systems etc. This article explains the originality of this exercise, its methodological specificity and the worldviews expressed by the actors consulted (including the general public), together with the common core of attitudes that emerges and the research strategies that may be derived from it, alongside the implications of these for French research etc.",,,,,,,"Suite à la décision du Comité de modernisation des politiques publiques réuni en juin 2008, un exercice de définition stratégique des priorités nationales en matière de recherche et d'innovation est en cours d'élaboration par le ministère français de la Recherche.

After 10 years of existence, however, the socio-economic conditions in Nunavut remain bleak. Still, there are some signs that the situation will improve in the future: Nunavut benefits from the highest economic annual growth in Canada, it is currently implementing an Inuit-based school curriculum reform, it is building additional social housing units, it has recently passed a language law that will reinforce the use of the Inuit language throughout Nunavut.

Health spending has become the fiscal equivalent of global warming, and the number of uninsured Americans is approaching fifty million. Can law help to divert our country from this path? There are reasons for deep skepticism. Law governs the provision and financing of medical care in fragmented and incoherent fashion. Commentators from diverse perspectives bemoan this chaos, casting it as an obstacle to change. I contend in this Article that pessimism about health law's prospects is unjustified, but that a new understanding of health law's disarray is urgently needed to guide reform. My core proposition is that the law of health care provision is best understood as an emergent system. Its contradictions and dysfunctions cannot be repaired by some master design. No one actor has a grand overview-or the power to impose a unifying vision. Countless market players, public planners, and legal and regulatory decisionmakers interact in oft-chaotic ways, clashing with, reinforcing, and adjusting to each other. Out of these interactions, a larger scheme emerges-one that incorporates the health sphere's competing interests and values. Change in this system, for worse and for better, arises from the interplay between its myriad actors. By quitting the quest for a single, master design, we can better focus our efforts on possibilities for legal and policy change. We can and should continuously survey the landscape of stakeholders and expectations with an eye toward potential launching points for evolutionary processes - processes that leverage current institutions and incentives. What we cannot do is plan or predict these evolutionary pathways in precise detail; the complexity of interactions among market and government actors precludes fine-grained foresight of this sort. But we can determine the general direction of needed change, identify seemingly intractable obstacles, and envision ways to diminish or finesse them over time. Dysfunctional legal doctrines, interest group expectations, consumers' anxieties, and embedded institutional and cultural barriers can all be dealt with in this way, in iterative fashion. This Article sets out a strategy for doing so. To illustrate this strategy, I suggest emergent approaches to the most urgent challenges in health care policy and law - the crises of access, value, and cost.",,,,,,,"CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR HEALTH CARE SPENDING 12 (2007). These CBO projections presume excess cost growth rates (rates by which medical cost increases exceed GDP growth) for Medicare, Medicaid, and other health spending that are well below historical averages. Were medical costs to continue to rise at historical rates, health spending would soar to an unimaginable 100 percent of GDP within seventy-five years; Id. app. D; The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the ranks of the uninsured to be forty-seven million in 2006 (just before the onset of the current recession). CARMEN DENAVASZ-WALT, BERNADETTE D. PROCTOR & JESSICA SMITH, U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, INCOME, POVERTY, AND HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES: 2006, at 18 (2007), available at http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60- 233.pdf; A rough rule of thumb is that each 1 percent rise in the unemployment rate boosts the number of uninsured adults by 1.1 million (job loss is thought not to substantially increase the number of children without insurance since children who lose coverage are typically eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP, KARYN SCHWARTZ, KAISER COMM'N ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, HEALTH COVERAGE IN A PERIOD OF RISING UNEMPLOYMENT 8 (2008, available at Thus, for example, were the unemployment rate to reach double digits 10 percent, five percentage points higher than the December 2007 unemployment rate-the number of uninsured adults would rise by 5.5 million.

Kohn et al. eds., 2000) (estimating, based on extrapolations from New York, Colorado, and Utah data, that between forty-four thousand and ninety-eight thousand Americans die prematurely from medical errors each year); Christopher Jennings, President Clinton's senior health policy advisor from 1994 through 2000 (and chief health policy advisor to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign) states that health care policy is the province of people with expertise in politics, economics, and medicine and public health, not law. Lawyers, he argues, should limit themselves to advising and advocating for their clients-and to implementing and enforcing policies formulated by others with relevant expertise. Interview with Christopher Jennings, President, Jennings Policy Strategies (Mar. 2007, Lawyers played peripheral roles in developing President Clinton's health reform plan, numerous participants in that process have told me, and President George W. Bush's health reform proposals (emphasizing high-deductible health plans and medical savings accounts) were developed by economist Katherine Baicker (a member of the Council of Economic Advisors) and her staff. Interview with Katherine Baicker; Frank H. Easterbrook, Cyberspace and the Law of the Horse, 1996 U. CHI. LEGAL F. 207, 207; This is not to say that laws pertaining to horses do not matter, but it is to suggest that the law of the horse is not usefully analyzed as a discrete field. Far better for most students, better, even, for those who plan to go into the horse trade, to take courses in property, torts, commercial transactions, and the like. Only by putting the law of the horse in the context of broader rules about commercial endeavors could one really understand the law about horses. Id. at 208; The number of these is difficult to estimate, but a fair measure may be the one hundred or so attendees that are typical at the annual Health Law Professors Conference, sponsored by the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics. See 2008 Health Law Professors Conference-escription, https://www.aslme.org/aslmesecure/info/description.php?confjd=70 (last visited Mar. 20, 2009). Most of these attendees hold faculty positions at law schools; others teach in schools of medicine and public health; The law-of-the-horse put-down has provoked a series of responses from leading health law scholars. See Einer R. Elhauge, Can Health Law Become a Coherent Field of Law?, 41 WAKE FOREST L. REV. 365 (2006);; Greely, H.T., Some Thoughts on Academic Health Law, 41 (2006) WAKE FOREST L. REV, 391; Mark A. Hall, The History and Future of Health Care Law: An Essentialist View, 41 Wake Forest L. Rev. 347 (2006). Earlier, George Annas wondered whether health law could be distinguished from law and a banana, George J. Annas, Health Law at the Turn of the Century: From White Dwarf to Red Giant, 21 conn. L. Rev. 551, 553 (1989), and Hall-long with Mary Anne Bobinski and David Orentlicher-retted that health law's topics were connected by happenstance, like the law of green things or the law of Tuesdays, MARK A. HALL, MARY ANNE BOBINSKI & DAVID ORENTLICHER, HEALTH CARE LAW & ETHICS, at xxxi (6th ed. 2003); This anxiety is justified by the peculiarities of legal academia's pecking order. As Henry Greely has pointed out, publications in elite medical and health policy venues like the New England Journal of Medicine and Health Affairs do not count for much when a candidate is being considered for a law faculty position or for tenure. And elite law reviews-hose at schools near the top of the U.S. News & World Report rankings-arely publish articles on health law topics. Since publication in these venues is the principal metric of scholarly accomplishment when hiring and tenure are at issue, would- be health law scholars face a competitive disadvantage. Greely, supra note 9, at 400-02. A glimpse at legal academia's skepticism about health law as a field was recently afforded by litigation (and discovery) that followed the University of Michigan Law School's denial of tenure to Peter Hammer in 2002. Hammer sued the school, alleging discrimination based on sexual; See CLARK C. HAVIGHURST, HEALTH CARE CHOICES 22-28 (1995) (calling for reinterpretation of health care law's diverse doctrines to support market competition among health plans); James F. Blumstein, Health Care Reform and Competing Visions of Medical Care: Antitrust and State Provider Cooperation Legislation, 79 cornell L. Rev. 1459 (1994) (same); Gregg Bloche, M., The Invention of Health Law, 91 (2003) Cal. L. Rev, 247, pp. 299-300. , urging that the task of health law be reconceived as mediation among medical care's competing therapeutic, caring, and other purposes, See also; Elhauge, supra note 9, at 388-90 (urging harmonization of health law doctrines to support a reform strategy that incorporates market competition, universal coverage, the setting of spending limits via political means, and some deference to physician judgment); William M. Sage, Managed Care's Crimea: Medical Necessity, Therapeutic Benefit, and the Goals of Administrative Process in Health Insurance, 53 duke L.J. 597, 630 n.131 (2003) (proposing that health care law be formulated based on therapeutic jurisprudence principles); See Greely, supra note 9, at 406-07 (advising health law scholars not to fret about the absence of an agreed-on organizing paradigm and to instead get on with the work of analyzing health care law's diverse problems, It is my impression (for which I do not claim proof) that health law scholars with left-of-center politics have been less inclined than have those toward the right to press for recognition of one or another overarching theory-and more inclined to press for particular legal changes without giving great weight to theory. Sara Rosenbaum, for example, has focused on expanding health care access and bringing civil rights law to bear on racial disparities in care. See Sara Rosenbaum & Joel Teitelbaum, Addressing Racial Inequality in Health Care, in POLICY CHALLENGES IN MODERN HEALTH CARE 135 David Mechanic et al. eds, 2005, George Annas has emphasized the importance of safeguarding patient autonomy and, more; They are, of course, not literally disinterested, they have preferences and passions and perhaps even clients and consulting arrangements in the health care industry, but they are not wholly committed to serving stakeholders' interests, as are legal practitioners, legislative advocates, and hospital and health plan officials; Scholars of health care law cannot be expected to have fine grain knowledge of medical practice, the organization and financing of care, or the myriad legal doctrines and regulatory frameworks that govern medical care provision and financing. Competent specialists in each of these areas will have richer local knowledge. Health law scholars are akin to general contractors: they should be sufficiently informed to see the connections and to tap specialized expertise when it can add substantial value; E.g., HALL ET AL., supra note 9, at xxxi; Bloche, supra note 11; Elhauge, supra note 9; Physician Financial Relationships with, and referrals to, Health Care Entities, 60 Fed.

See Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U.S. 355, 365 2002, stating that congressional language seems simultaneously to preempt everything and hardly anything; See Russell Korobkin, The Failed Jurisprudence of Managed Care, and How to Fix It: Reinterpreting ERISA Preemption, 51 UCLA L. REV. 457, 534 (2003) [hereinafter Korobkin, Reinterpreting ERISA Preemption]; Russell Korobkin, The Battle over Self-Insured Health Plans, or One Good Loophole Deserves Another, 5 YALE J. HEALTH POL'Y L. & ETHICS 89, 89-90 (2005) [hereinafter Korobkin, Battle over Self-Insured Health Plans]. Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200 (2004), put the question of employer-sponsored health plans' liability for coverage denials to rest by holding that ERISA preempts state tort liability; Several states, including Massachusetts, California, Connecticut, and Maryland, are considering (or, in Massachusetts' case, implementing) plans that would expand coverage in part by requiring employers to choose between providing coverage themselves, or paying taxes or fees to support state-sponsored coverage. ERISA preemption jeopardizes these efforts. See, e.g, Retail Indus. Leaders Ass'n v. Fielder, 475 F.3d 180, 198 (4th Cir. 2007, holding that ERISA preempts Maryland's so-called Wal-Mart law, requiring firms with ten thousand or more employees to spend 8 percent or more of their payrolls on medical coverage for their workers, Retail Indus. Leaders Ass'n v. Suffolk County, 497 F. Supp. 2d 403, 416-18 (E.D.N.Y. 2007, But see Golden Gate Rest. Ass'n v.

L. REV, 545, p. 637. , See; See supra, , The Peter Hammer affair, due to the discovery process that followed his lawsuit against the University of Michigan for denial of tenure, became the occasion for rare public expression of this sentiment, note 10. But I have heard it expressed frequently, in private, in conversations about faculty hiring with legal scholars at elite schools; The law of the horse itself is not quite passe, as my colleague, Michael Seidman, could not resist pointing out. Books on the subject include: DONALD CASSELL & r.j.F. GORDON, THE HORSE AND THE LAW (1987); JULIE I. FERSHTMAN, EQUINE LAW & HORSE SENSE (1996); BRENDA GILLIGAN, PRACTICAL HORSE LAW (2002); EDWARD H. GREENE, THE LAW AND YOUR HORSE (1971); MURRAY LOR1NG, YOUR HORSE AND THE LAW (1975); JULIE MACKENZIE, HORSE LAW (2001); C.L. PANNAM, THE HORSE AND THE LAW (2d ed. 1986); THEODORE JOHN SOPHIAN, HORSES AND THE LAW (1972); JOHN WEATHERILL, HORSES AND THE LAW (1979); One could say equally of environmental law and the law of the horse that they are constituted by property, torts, commercial transactions, and the like. Easterbrook, supra note 6, at 208. Indeed, environmental law is much more of a hodgepodge than is the law of the horse, since myriad state and federal regulatory regimes contribute to it; See supra note 10; Elhauge, supra note 9, at 366-67; The extent to which law's categories and procedures constrain discretion is, of course, much disputed-this large question has long been one of the central foci of legal scholarship for the past century. E.g., Frederick Shauer, The Limited Domain of the Law, 90 VA. L. REV. 1909, 1915-17 (2004); DWORKIN, R., EMPIRE, L., (1986), 219 -24. , See; The Supreme Court cited this concern in Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211 (2000), as a reason for rejecting a health plan subscriber's bid to construe ERISA to bar some, but not all, financial rewards to physicians for withholding costly treatments. Holding that ERISA's fiduciary duty provisions did not apply to a health plan's attending physicians, the Court said it lacked the health policy expertise necessary to distinguish between acceptable and troublesome incentives to clinical caregivers to practice frugally, and thus would not apply ERISA fiduciary duty principles to the practice of medicine. Id. at 222,231-33; This is not to say that environmental law (or any other hodgepodge field) achieves such coherence, sharp differences over such matters as the role of cost-benefit analysis stand in the way. It is merely to say that pursuit of such coherence across diverse doctrinal spheres and regulatory schemes is a widely recognized environmental law goal; Section 514 of ERISA preempts state laws that relate to fringe benefit plans. 29 U.S.C. § 1144 (2006, To allow patients to sue HMOs in state courts for negligent care by staff physicians, some courts characterized HMOs as medical care providers rather than as components of employers' fringe benefit plans. See Bloche, supra note 11, at 301; Korobkin, Reinterpreting ERISA Preemption, supra note 19, at 535. And to circumvent ERISA preemption of actions against employer-provided health plans for negligent refusal to authorize services, some courts characterized health plans' utilization management decisions as medical rather than administrative. Korobkin, Reinterpreting ERISA Preemption, supra note 19, at 522. The former characterization has thus far survived; the latter was rejected by the Supreme Court in 2004. See Aetna Health Inc. v.

FTC, 526 U.S. 756 771-73 (1999) (upholding a professional society's restraints on advertising as procompetitive on the ground that they protected patients against misleading claims). Some market-oriented health law scholars have been sharply critical of courts' willingness to soften their application of antitrust principles when confronted with claims from professionals that unmitigated competition might harm patients. See, e.g., Clark C. Havighurst, Health Care as a (Big) Business: The Antitrust Response, 26 j. HEALTH POL. POL'Y & L. 939,949-53 (2001); A much publicized RAND Corporation study of clinical decisionmaking found that American patients receive only 54.9 percent of recommended care when measured against a set of more than four hundred evidence-based best-practice standards.

Though health law commentators have been making this point for a generation, see, e.g, Clark C. Havighurst, Regulation of Health Facilities and Services by Certificate of Need, 59 VA. L. REV. 1143 1973, robust CON regulation and antitrust enforcement persist, side by side; Interest groups at play in statehouses across the country include providers' trade associations and patient advocacy groups, which tend to push for expansion of coverage for particular services, and insurers and employers, which resist new coverage mandates in order to control costs and maintain market flexibility; Such an intellectual immersion is at high risk of yielding work that strikes legal scholars as of limited reach and therefore uninteresting; See Plaintiffs Brief, supra note 10 (asserting that an elite law school should give little weight to the opinions of health law scholars when assessing tenure candidates' work); Both state that health care's distinctive features are so important to the analysis of legal issues that an industry-wide focus is preferable to treatment of health care as just another application of generic legal doctrines. hall et al, supra note 9, at 361; Elhauge, supra note 9, at 380. Elhauge distinguishes his argument from Hall's by chiding Hall for failing to say why medicine's unique features merit treatment of health law as a separate field. Elhauge, supra note 9, at 380-81. But Hall does point to particular features that he says might merit separate legal treatment: these include the vulnerability of patients, the professional ideals of health care providers, the role of trust and dependency in relations between the two, and medicine's existential stakes. hall et al, supra note 9, at 358.

See also CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, supra note 1 (projecting unsustainable increases in both public and private sector medical spending absent dramatic policy changes); Assuming no increase in the percentage of GDP going to taxes, the federal deficit would rise from just over 1 percent of GDP in 2005 to almost 8 percent of GDP in 2030, nearly 12 percent in 2040, and 16 percent in 2050. Aaron, supra note 41 (citing Congressional Budget Office projections); Id. As Aaron notes, neither long-term Social Security obligations nor growth in other entitlement programs are projected to make substantial contributions to the long-term federal deficit. Assuming no cuts in Social Security benefits or increases in Social Security taxes, the projected Social Security shortfall over the next thirty to forty years is about 2.5 percent of GDP - hardly trivial, but small compared to the federal government's health care burden. Projected decreases (measured in terms of percentage points of GDP) in other parts of the budget will fully compensate for this Social Security shortfall. Id. (relying on Congressional Budget Office projections); The United States is alone in relying so heavily on employers to provide coverage to its nonelderly. Other industrialized countries (except for China, which does not provide universal coverage) spread this expense more broadly, through various public-financing schemes.

My own view is that Pegram was unwisely decided. The Justices took no account of the corrosive effect of payments to physicians for withholding care on professional trustworthiness and the doctor-patient relationship. It is indisputable that rationing is inevitable when a health plan undertakes to provide care within a limited budget, but it is hardly the case that physicians must play the lead role in doing the necessary rationing. See M. Gregg Bloche & Peter D. Jacobson, Commentary, The Supreme Court and Bedside Rationing, 284 JAMA 2776, 2777 2000, Pegram nevertheless represents an effort to accommodate vital health policy concerns, in this case, the importance of cost containment, and to harmonize the operation of uncoordinated legal and regulatory schemes within the constraints of existing doctrine; Pegram, 530 U.S. at 221; Two articles by Russell Korobkin on ERISA's treatment of employment-based health plans' coverage determinations, Korobkin, Reinterpreting ERISA Preemption, supra note 19, and states' efforts to extend coverage to the uninsured, Korobkin, Battle over Self-Insured Health Plans, supra note 19, represent, in my view, the finest effort by a legal scholar to resolve ERISA's vagaries in a manner sensitive to both health policy concerns and the surrounding legal and regulatory context; Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, Pub.

I am not going so far as to assert that Havighurst's work alone brought about this impact-the decisiveness of its influence would be exceedingly difficult to assess-but it is beyond question that Havighurst has been the preeminent voice for this model among health law scholars; Va, G.V., (1975) State Bar, 421, pp. 787-788. , U.S. 773; Arrow, K.J., Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care, 53 (1963) Am.

Malpractice law typically accords partisan experts trump status over standards of care developed by academic and clinical leaders, based on scientific evidence. This makes malpractice litigation into something of a roulette wheel, since doctors' practice styles vary greatly and often depart from evidence-based standards. Cf. CTR.

Gregg Bloche, Race and Discretion in American Medicine, I YALE J. HEALTH POL'Y L. & ETHICS 95 (2001) (analyzing racial disparities in health care as the product of interaction between clinical uncertainty, institutional and economic incentives, bias and stereotypes, and historical discrimination); Current informed-consent doctrine, as Katz points out, makes little space for individual patients' varying preferences. Katz, supra note 108, at 82-84. In most states, physicians need only tell patients about risks and benefits that a reasonable physician would deem material to a patient's decision. (The reasonable physician standard, moreover, is typically applied by reference to prevailing professional approaches to disclosure.) In other jurisdictions, doctors must disclose those risks and benefits that a reasonable patient would deem material. This rule is no more friendly to individual differences in patients' beliefs, hopes, and fears. See id. at 81-82; To be sure, medical necessity clauses in insurance contracts limit physicians' ability to accommodate patients' subjective preferences. Insurers employ these clauses to resist covering care that lies at or beyond the margins of accepted clinical practice. On the other hand, health insurance law (which itself embodies tension between support for cost control and for patients' and doctors' clinical freedom) makes it risky for insurers to say no to such care. Constraints on nay-saying by insurers include the availability of independent medical review in cases of coverage denial in at least forty states, see Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U.S. 355, 369 (2002, and rules of insurance contract interpretation (for example, the principle that ambiguous contract language must be construed based on the reasonable expectations of the insured, 43 AM.

INST, OF MED., supra note 112, at 131-35; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which typically costs in excess of $800, is an illustration. Should savvy and assertive patients be referred for MRIs to rule out exceedingly unlikely illnesses simply because these patients verbalize their anxieties (and make demands of their doctors) with less reserve than do others? Turning informed-consent law into a cudgel against doctors who resist such entreaties would further empower the most privileged patients and thus widen socioeconomic and racial disparities in medical care; Since, within any given insurance plan, all pay the same premium, more demanding patients would enjoy subsidies from those in the same clinical circumstances who ask for less; See Greely, supra note 9, at 408; supra notes 105-08 and accompanying text; My proposition is not that health care law is (in some absolute sense) an emergent system; my claim, rather, is that the emergent systems model has value as a tool for understanding and navigating the obstacles to health law reform; See, e.g., GERALD M. EDELMAN, BRIGHT AIR, BRILLIANT FIRE 7, 39-41 (1992) (analyzing intelligence and consciousness as the emergent product of neural networks); BERT HOLLDOBLER & EDWARD O. WILSON, THE ANTS (1990) (analyzing the complex social organization of ants (and other insects) as the emergent product of simple biochemical signals exchanged among individual ants); STUART A. KAUFFMAN, THE ORIGINS OF ORDER (1993) (drawing on complexity theory to analyze evolution as a nonlinear process); See, e.g., ROBERT AXELROD & MICHAEL D. COHEN, HARNESSING COMPLEXITY (2000) (urging business leaders to think of their organizations as complex adaptive systems, empowered by variation, in both product lines and decisionmaking strategies, to adjust to changing market conditions); THOMAS C. SCHELLING, MICROMOTIVES AND MACROBEHAVIOR 13-14 (1978) (considering the connections between individual incentives and patterns of social behavior); The logic of emergent systems is, from the perspective of the aims we seek, often perverse: common examples include the development and spread of cancer, epidemics, war, and economic bubbles and busts. See. e.g., ROBERT J. SHILLER, IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE 15-17 (2d ed. 2005) (tracing breakdowns in market valuation that arise from interactions between individuals' self- deceptions and misperceptions); See generally JOHN H. HOLLAND, EMERGENCE: FROM CHAOS TO ORDER (1998) (laying out the idea of emergence); STUART KAUFFMAN, AT HOME IN THE UNIVERSE (1995) (offering accounts of how order in complex systems emerges from innumerable interactions among simpler elements); Standard examples of agencies that function as the principal authorities within their realms of law and policy include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Environmental Protection Agency; The emergent properties of health care law (by comparison to other areas of law) are a matter of degree. All areas of law are influenced by multiple, interacting decisionmakers; thus all areas of law can be seen as emergent to some degree. My limited point here is that the law of health care provision and financing is more dependent on myriad, minimally coordinated decisionmakers, and less influenced in top-down fashion by centralized legal authority, than almost any other field of law; Bonabeau, E., Theraulaz, G., (2000) Swarm Smarts, p. 72. , Sci.

Commentators on environmental law have drawn an analogy between ecosystems (often analyzed by researchers as complex adaptive systems characterized by self-organization and nonlinear responses to changing conditions) and the legal regimes designed to protect them. They have argued that complexity (and the variation it generates) makes legal governance more robust, more responsive to changing circumstances, just as complexity and chaos (which engender variation and thus expand evolutionary options) make species and ecosystems better able to adapt to change. This line of reasoning has led them to favor such approaches as greater devolution of regulatory authority to the states and the vesting of federal regulatory authority in multiple, overlapping agencies.

REV. 463, 507-09 (2002); I have oversimplified my depictions of these sets of concerns - the thinking behind both (that is, consumer-choice approaches and policies that put greater emphasis on equity and/or reliance on professional norms) is more nuanced and variegated. But my oversimplification will serve to support the larger point I am making here about the role of these suites of concern in health law's emergence; Since the late 1970s, health care law has shifted dramatically toward the market model, albeit not as wholeheartedly as some market enthusiasts would have preferred. See supra text accompanying notes 74-96; See, e.g., Retail Indus. Leaders Ass'n v. Fielder, 475 F.3d 180 (4th Cir. 2007) (holding that ERISA preempts Maryland's so-called Wal-Mart law, requiring firms with ten thousand or more employees to spend 8 percent or more of their payrolls on medical coverage for their workers). Efforts by multiple states, most notably Massachusetts and California, to expand coverage by requiring employers to contribute more toward medical costs, will likely lead to reprises of this struggle in the months and years ahead; See supra, , text accompanying notes 120-24; Although the Daubert principle, requiring that expert testimony on scientific and technical matters be grounded in scientific knowledge, Daubert v. Merrell DOW Pharms, Inc, 509 U.S. 579, 589-90 1993, has been applied by state as well as federal courts in many legal contexts, it has not generally been applied to medical testimony concerning appropriate treatment in malpractice and insurance coverage cases. Courts' peculiar reluctance to extend Daubert to these contexts probably reflects their regard for physicians' clinical judgment, the proverbial art of medicine, when supporting scientific evidence is lacking; Gregg Bloche, M., Studdert, D.M., A Quiet Revolution: Law as an Agent of Health System Change (2004) HEALTH AFF, p. 29. , Mar.-Apr, at; Id. at 37-38; See supra, , text accompanying note 86-89; See supra, , note 95 and accompanying text; See supra, , text accompanying notes 95-101; The Court is, to be sure, an outsized participant: its signal to these networks is decisive on federal law matters plainly covered by its precedents, and it is loud, due to its audibility, even on matters outside this scope. Yet the network metaphor still holds: by analogy to strategically placed cells in neural networks, the Justices have much influence, but they exercise it through constrained channels in response to other decisionmakers; An example is the effort by some state and federal judges, beginning in the late 1990s, to chart a path around ERISA preemption of managed care liability for negligent coverage denial. See Bloche, supra note 11, at 301. To avert preemption under ERISA's section 514 of state laws that relate to employment-based health plans, 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a, 2006, judges sought to characterize health plans' coverage determinations as medical judgments (beyond the preemptive reach of section 514, based on established precedent) rather than plan administration (clearly within ERISA's preemptive shield, See Bloche, supra note 11, at 301. Variants of this approach caught on in some jurisdictions, including several federal circuits, but the Supreme Court squelched the strategy in 2004, in Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200, 208-21 2004, holding broadly that ERISA's preemption provisions preclude such liability; Va, G.V., (1975) State Bar, 421, pp. 787-788. , U.S. 773; Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, Pub.

Gregg Bloche, Medical Ethics in the Courts, in ETHICAL DIMENSIONS OF HEALTH POLICY 133, 135-40 (Marion Danis et al. eds., 2002) (considering the emergence of patient autonomy as a value in bioethics commentary and legal doctrine during the 1960s and 1970s); In my view, David Hyman is by far the most engaging - and insightful - on this theme. See, e.g., DAVID A. HYMAN, MEDICARE MEETS MEPHISTOPHELES (2006); President Franklin Roosevelt, a law school dropout, intuited open and closed pathways with aplomb as he maneuvered through political and legal obstacles to his economic reform strategies, then to the waging of war.

See supra Part III.A. Emergent software is illustrative: its repeat plays of a given, complex scenario (for example, a model for the spread of an epidemic, the propagation of a financial panic, or the evolution of traits by natural selection) yield different results. The predictive power of such software comes not from individual runs, or plays, but from large numbers of plays (made possible by enormous computing power) that, together, suggest the range of possible outcomes; GREGG BLOCHE, M., HARM, D.N., (2009) supra, , See, forthcoming, Bloche, note 11; Robin Toner & Janet Elder, Most Support U.S. Guarantee of Health Care, N.Y.

See RONALD L.

Id. at 156-58. On the other hand, public coverage sufficient to provide access to comprehensive, mainstream care would cost more than the current, incomplete web of cross-subsidies for care in hospitals and community clinics; Resistance to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's failed health reform plan was illustrative. Schwarzenegger proposed in 2007 to pay for expanded medical coverage in part by pooling current cross-subsidy streams and rechanneling them from hospitals and clinics to support insurance premiums for the less well-off. GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CAL., GOVERNOR'S HEALTH CARE PROPOSAL 7 (2007), http://gov.ca.gov/pdf/press/Governors-HC-Proposal.pdf. Health care providers-the recipients of these cross-subsidies-have fretted about the prospect that they could lose these crosssubsidies and still face a substantial uncompensated care burden, absent the achievement of universal coverage.]; Butler, S., Aaron, H., (2007) A Bipartisan Push on Healthcare, , http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/11/AR200705 1101784.html, See, WASHINGTONPOST.COM, May 13; Multistate employers, especially, dread the prospect of myriad state regimes, each with its own minimum coverage requirements and revenue-raising scheme; There is no small risk here.

Former Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis argues that California and other states considering such initiatives should ignore the ERISA preemption issue as they draft legislation, then ask Congress to either exempt them or to trim back the preemption for everyone. Personal Communication with Michael Dukakis, in L.A., Cal. (Feb. 2007); The extent to which ERISA preempts state laws requiring employers to either provide coverage for their employees (up to some state-defined minimum level of benefits) or to contribute funds in some other fashion, toward coverage of the uninsured, will be the principal focus of such preemption litigation as state reform gathers steam. See supra note 20. State insurance market reforms, including new mechanisms for pooling risk among small employers, could also face preemption challenges under ERISA; See N.Y. State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 659-62 (1995) (holding that state law requiring hospitals to collect higher payments from commercial insurers than from nonprofit Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans survives ERISA section 514 preemption); E.g., Retail Indus. Leaders Ass'n v. Fielder, 475 F.3d 180 (4th Cir. 2007); The leading proponent of this view among legal scholars is Richard Epstein. See generally RICHARD A. EPSTEIN, MORTAL PERIL: OUR INALIENABLE RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE? (1997); There are innumerable examples of leading scholarly efforts to make the case for government action to achieve universal coverage. See, e.g., DANIELS, supra note 71, at 42-48 (making a Rawlsian case for universal coverage); EZEKIEL j. EMANUEL, THE ENDS OF HUMAN LIFE 120-24, 178-97 (1991) (criticizing Rawlsian arguments and making a communitarian case); MICHAEL WALZER, SPHERES OF JUSTICE 64-94 (1983) (offering communitarian arguments).

Here, conservatives have a point (in my view) when they chide some liberals for characterizing these behaviors as wholly the products of illness, compulsion, corporate marketing, or social injustice, rather than personal choice. Social norms that reward self-control and punish lapses have a role. See M. Gregg Bloche, Obesity and the Struggle Within Ourselves, 93 GEO. L.J. 1335, 1351-54 (2005, This is hardly to say that social conditions have no causal role in behaviors that put health at risk; to the contrary, poverty and its tendency to keep people focused on their immediate needs, environmental disadvantages, the media's messages, and other social circumstances are important factors. But a sense of individual responsibility can make a positive health difference, even when social unfairness renders the playing field uneven; The health care reform ideas being taken seriously in state capitals and in the 2008 presidential campaign are notable for their emphasis on personal responsibility. Bloche, supra note 181, at 1174-75.

Id. at 382-83. Other proposed justifications for tax exemption include Henry Hansmann's argument that it compensates for nonprofit firms' disadvantage in raising capital, owing to their inability to distribute profits to owners, and the nonprofit hospital sector's claim that nonprofit status yields community benefits, beyond free care, deserving of public subsidy. Id. at 320-22; Instead of being beneficiaries of hospital charity, the (formerly) uninsured would become consumers with purchasing power and choice of providers. Id. at 334; Tax subsidies for hospitals support hospital-based care, rather than the full range of clinical services (including outpatient screening, chronic disease management, and preventive care) available to patients with adequate insurance. Tax subsidies are thus a poor substitute for insurance. Id. at 369; But see Jill R. Horwitz, Why We Need the Independent Sector: The Behavior, Law and Ethics of Not-for-Proflt Hospitals, 50 UCLA L. REV. 1345, 1346-47 (2003) (arguing that nonprofit hospitals supply community benefits that merit tax exemption); http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstracty25/4/W304, Although tax exemption is, in my view, unjustifiable, see Bloche, supra note 186, from a policy analytic perspective, its persistence presents an opportunity. Rather than insisting on its elimination, one might (from an emergent systems perspective) seize on it opportunistically, as a fulcrum for policy leverage. This might be accomplished by taking nonprofit hospitals' claims of community benefit, see Horowitz, supra note 190, very seriously, to the point of conditioning tax exemption upon hospitals' achievement of benchmarks for health promotion, clinical quality, and as care for the needy. Transforming tax exemption into a type of pay-for-performance, in this fashion, is politically and legally more plausible than eliminating it altogether. M. Gregg Bloche, Tax Preferences for Nonprofits: From Per Se Exemption to Pay-for-Performance, 25 HEALTH AFF. W304 2006; See, e.g, HYMAN, supra note 157, at 27-47; This points to another role for health law and policy scholars, as participants in the process of emergence. Scholars of health care governance are uniquely positioned to detect embedded interest- group influence, to expose it, and to speak to public audiences about its pernicious policy and legal impact. They are especially well-situated to identify cases of government responsiveness to this influence and to call public officials to account when they service parochial interests. This has traditionally been the role of investigative journalists, but deeply probing reporting on public affairs is in decline. National news organizations are budgeting less for investigative reporting and in-depth analysis, and recent changes in the ownership and business objectives of leading newspapers (most visibly the sale of the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal by founding families deeply committed to these publications' journalistic missions) could lead to further declines; Options included R.I.

Potent opposition from health insurers and other interest groups had a large impact, as did the Clinton administration's tactical missteps. See JOHNSON & BRODER, supra note 60, at 123-24, 137 - 207; Kristol did not explicitly invoke emergent systems thinking, but he thought emergently. He strategized to create conditions more likely to give rise to feelings and beliefs conducive to longer-term Republican political and policy success; The Clinton plan's regulatory mechanisms addressed myriad matters in top-down fashion, including specification of minimum benefits to be provided by competing health plans, establishment of cross-subsidies among insurers to compensate for risk selection and adverse selection, and requirements that employers assume financial and administrative responsibility for employee coverage; Proposal of the Physicians' Working Group for Single-Payer National Health Insurance, 290 (2003) JAMA, 798. , urging complete replacement of private insurance by public, single-payer coverage without discussion of transition issues, aside from a brief mention of job retraining programs for insurance company employees, See, e.g, Physicians' Working Group for Single-Payer Nat'l Health Ins; Adoption of single-payer coverage would put an end to cash flows in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year from private health care payers to hospitals, doctors, drug and device makers, and others. Cash flows from the public payer (or payers, if a system of regional payers were adopted) would commence in lieu of private payments, but there would surely be substantial changes in coverage policies and amounts paid, with profound financial implications for health care providers. Moreover, many of the millions of Americans who administer our decentralized system of private coverage and payment could find themselves out of work. There would be ripple effects as well, on labor markets as millions, or at least hundreds of thousands, found themselves out of work, businesses that look to insurance companies for investment capital, and economic sectors that depend, in turn, on these businesses' buying power and on the purchasing power of insurance company employees; I take no position here on the policy question of whether a single-payer model would be better as an end state, in the abstract, than other universal coverage schemes. For a powerful argument that the single-payer model is superior, see THEODORE R. MARMOR, UNDERSTANDING HEALTH CARE REFORM 215-33 (1994). My limited point is that top-down imposition of a single-payer model by legislative enactment would be so disruptive as to preclude its happening; See supra notes 173-74 (discussing possible ERISA preemption of state laws requiring employers to contribute toward their workers' health benefits or toward funds established to subsidize coverage for the uninsured); Mitt Romney, Rudolph Giuliani, and Barack Obama were among the candidates who made greater deference to state initiatives part of their campaign messages on health care. However, they did not specify the legal changes they would pursue in order to accomplish this. See Robin Toner, 2008 Candidates Vow to Overhaul U.S. Health Care, N.Y.

REV. 1449,1493-1524(1994); People able and willing to pay will have access to extant treatments regardless of the limit- setting treatments that health plans make, but thumbs-down judgments by health plans could reduce wealthy people's demand for some treatments by stamping them as low-value; Early versions of President Clinton's health plan included global budgets - national and regional - to be implemented as a backup cost-control strategy if managed competition failed. In the face of strong resistance from health care interest groups (and charges from Republicans that the Clinton plan would ration care), the Clinton plan's drafters transfigured their global budgets into a comprehensive scheme of caps on health plan rates - and, therefore, health plan spending. Continued characterizations of this aspect of the plan as health care rationing played a substantial role in the Clinton plan's declining popularity and eventual defeat. See JOHNSON & BRODER, supra note 60, at 85- 86, 161-63; SKOCPOL, supra note 159, at 39-47; Americans' resistance to health plan budget limits played out in different forms during the several years after the Clinton plan's collapse, as employers shifted vast numbers of workers into HMOs and other restrictive health plans. Beginning in the late 1990s, restrictions on choice of provider and access to costly treatments triggered intense popular backlash expressed through political, legal, and market mechanisms, see supra text accompanying notes 145-48, forcing health plans to abandon these restrictions and allow costs to float upward. More worrisome is our country's resistance to limits on Medicare spending, though Medicare's long-term threat to American fiscal stability dwarfs that posed by Social Security, military spending, or any other federal program.

In practice, this scenario is implausible, since coverage policies that deviate from industry practice would spark hostile reactions (including appeals to state-mandated independent reviewers and to the courts) from doctors and patients. To defend these policies, the plan would have to explain them, by going public with its research design and results, and thereby transforming its proprietary information into a public good; The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) reports that its members spent S$44.5 billion on drug research and development in 2007, and that such spending for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole was S$58.8 billion. PhRMA, About PhRMA: Who We Are, http://www.phrma.org/about-phrma/ (last visited Mar. 20, 2009). Skeptics contend that a great deal of this purported investment in research is in fact disguised advertising and other promotional spending. E.g., JERRY AVORN, POWERFUL MEDICINES 198-216 (2004); The FDA has taken the position that its enabling statute does not permit it to consider a candidate drug's cost-effectiveness or comparative value. The relevant statutory language requires only that drugs be safe and effective; it thereby supports this position. JOHN R. THOMAS, PHARMACEUTICAL PATENT LAW 2005, The pharmaceutical industry opposes Congressional revision of the FDA's enabling statute to empower the agency to consider comparative efficacy, value, or cost; Elhauge, supra note 225, at 1496; Heart surgeons perform bypass surgery; angioplasty is typically performed by cardiologists internists who have done fellowships in cardiology; See Bloche, supra note 11, at 276 discussing this problem as an instance of bounded rationality in health care policy; For example, anticipated differences in the effectiveness of coronary angioplasty - depending on the anatomy of a patient's coronary vasculature, the extent and distribution of atherosclerotic disease across this vasculature, differences in lipid chemistry (for example, levels of high and low density lipoproteins, known to be mediators of cardiovascular risk), behavioral and lifestyle factors, genetic markers, and age - might lead clinical investigators to narrow the inclusion criteria for an angioplasty trial on such grounds. But by so doing, the investigators narrow the real-world clinical relevance of their findings to the subset of cardiovascular disease patients who meet these inclusion criteria; See, e.g., Thomas J. Lynch et al., Activating Mutations in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Underlying Responsiveness of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer to Gefitinib, 350 NEW ENG. J. MED. 2129 (2004) (reporting on genetic variations that dramatically increase one particular type of tumor's responsiveness to a chemotherapy agent previously found to be only minimally effective for patients with this tumor type); Patients who vest hope in the disallowed therapy represent additional leverage for health care providers and drug and device makers intent on challenging clinical protocols. The lobbying efforts of the so-called Center for Patient Advocacy are a high profile example. The Center was founded by a back surgeon opposed to a federal agency's 1993 practice protocol that came out against spinal fusion and discectomy surgery for low back pain. Brownlee, supra note 231, at 28. Not only did it advocate successfully against broad adoption of this protocol by health care payers, but it also lobbied successfully, in conjunction with other provider groups, as well as drug and medical device manufacturers, for federal legislation that downsized the offending agency and forbade it from issuing additional practice protocols. Id. On this and other issues, the Center has leveraged people's trust in their doctors, as well as their worries about insurers' skimping on care. Links, accompani; Explicit cost consciousness has not, thus far, been incorporated into protocols developed by federal agencies, professional societies, or medical academics. Cost sensitivity has played a role in proprietary payment protocols employed by health plans, but there have been no reports of plans weighing costs against benefits in systematic fashion; rather, consideration of costs has been ad hoc; Bloche, supra note 11, at 270-71; For an excellent review of these formulations and their shortcomings, see Elhauge, supra note 225, at 1493-1526; Havighurst envisions a medical marketplace made up of differently priced private health plans, offering multiple tiers of quality and different cost-benefit trade-off policies. Consumers would choose from among these plans based on both their ex ante preferences concerning cost-benefit tradeoff policies and their willingness and ability to pay. havighurst, supra note 11, at 22-24. Elhauge, by contrast, envisions a marketplace of equally priced private health plans, offering benefits of equivalent actuarial value. Elhauge, supra note 225, at 1524-26, 1529-30, 1538-44. Public financing (constrained by a politically determined global health care budget) would cover the cost of enrollment. The plans would offer a variety of clinical resource allocation policies readily comprehensible to consumers, who could then choose from among competing plans based on their ex ante resource allocation preferences. Id. at 1524-26. Patients could purchase additional care out-of; As Elhauge points out, the ex ante perspective is essential here. Id. at 1507. Allowing patients to choose cost-benefit trade-off policies (at the insurance pool's expense) ex post the onset of illness reintroduces the moral hazard problem that choice between allocation policies from behind the veil of ignorance (about future medical problems) is meant to avoid. Also, as Elhauge notes, the validity of ex ante consent to an allocation policy is contingent upon the judgment that the conditions under which consent was given are morally acceptable. Id. at 1536. The public subsidies that Elhauge envisions, which would ensure universal coverage sufficient to purchase health care at levels now affordable to the middle class, suffice (in my view) to render the conditions of ex ante consent morally acceptable under Elhauge's scheme; The principal moral concern that many share - that this approach legitimizes multiple tiers of coverage and care, tied to ability to pay (an objectionable development if one views health care as a merit good) - dissolves if the less well off are given public subsidies sufficient to enable them to afford the levels of coverage and care that middle-class Americans now receive. See Elhauge, supra note 225, at 1491 &n. 124; Bloche, supra note 11, at 276-77; This is an instance of the more general truth, increasingly recognized by cognitive scientists, that people engage in conscious reasoning for only a small fraction of the many quick-fire judgments they make each day. See GERD GIGERENZER, PETER M. TODD & ABC RESEARCH GROUP, SIMPLE HEURISTICS THAT MAKE US SMART 141-67 1999, employing medical and other examples to argue that people make most decisions by employing fast and frugal heuristics, not conscious, systematic reasoning; See generally BOUNDED RATIONALITY (G. Gigerenzer & R. Selten eds., 2002) (reviewing a variety of psychological adaptations to human cognitive limitations, including cultural norms, imitation, and emotional responses, as well as unconscious heuristics); Physicians' past responses to heterogeneous incentives from different payers reflect this limitation. When, in 1983, Medicare radically changed the way it paid for acute inpatient care - shifting from fee-for-service to lump-sum payment based on diagnosis - hospitals reduced their average lengths of stay for all populations of insured patients - private, fee-for-service as well as Medicare. Judith Feder, Jack Hadley & Stephen Zuckerman, How Did Medicare's Prospective Payment System Affect Hospitals?, 317 NEW ENG. J. MED. 867, 870 & tbl.2 (1987); This reduction was an expected response to the new Medicare reimbursement scheme, which rewarded frugality through the lump-sum method. But its spillover into the fee-for-service market was surprising, since this spillover reduced hospitals' revenues from private, fee-for-service patients. It is difficult to explain this spillover except as an expression of physicians' bounded rationality, their inability to change their approach to Medicare patients without also changing their approach to fee-for- service inpatients. More recently, studies of physicians who see patients covered under multiple private plans with differing incentives, for example, fee-for-service, capitation, and other schemes that reward doctors for doing less, have found that doctors do not vary their practice styles for patients in differing plans. See, e.g, Laurence C. Baker, Association of Managed Care Market Share and Health Expenditures for Fee-for-Service Medicare Patients, 281 JAMA 432; The Kaiser-Permanente system (comprised of an HMO and a set of medical practice groups that treat only subscribers to the Kaiser HMO) is the most prominent example of a plan organized in this fashion. See Fast Facts About Kaiser Permanente, http://xnet.kp.org/newscenter/aboutkp/ fastfacts.html (last visited Mar. 20,2009); Outside of such areas, there probably is not sufficient demand to support multiple lineups of specialty care providers, each dedicated to a single health plan. See, e.g., Rebecca T. Slifkin, Thomas C. Ricketts III & Hilda A. Howard, Potential Effects of Managed Competition in Rural Areas, HEALTH CARE FINANCING REV., Summer 1996, at 143 (discussing difficulties that confront efforts to engender competition between multiple health plans, with their own doctors and hospitals, in rural environments); One can interpret this in Coasean, theory-of-the-firm terms. See R.H. Coase, The Nature of the Firm, 4 ECONOMICA 386 (1937). The higher transaction costs associated with the independence of specialty physicians (and tertiary care hospitals) are counterbalanced by the benefits (for both health plans and providers of specialized services) of the flexibility that comes from annual contracting in a quickly changing marketplace, as compared with the rigidities and sunk costs of vertical integration. See James C. Robinson, The Future of Managed Care Organization, HEALTH AFF., Mar./Apr. 1999, at 7,8-9,12-14, 17-23; For a blunt discussion of the need to ration beneficial care in order to hold medical spending to manageable levels, see AARON & SCHWARTZ, supra note 66, at 6-8; Robert Pear, The R Word: Justice Souier Takes on a Health Care Taboo, N.Y. TIMES, June 18,2000, §4, at 3; The charge that President Clinton's health reform plan (which envisioned competition among HMOs and other prepaid managed health plans) countenanced the rationing of care was one of the missives hurled by the plan's Republican critics in 1993 and 1994. A few years later, when House Republicans proposed that Medicare beneficiaries be enrolled in HMOs, Democrats returned the favor, claiming that Republicans were planning to ration senior citizens' care. See Robert Pear, Familiar Ring to the G.O.P Medicare Plan? It's What Clinton Talked About, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 26, 1995, at A20. Both accusations were accurate. A unanimous Supreme Court said as much in Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 221 2000, when it noted that inducement to ration care goes to the very point of any HMO scheme; See JOHN M. EISENBERO, DOCTORS' DECISIONS AND THE COST OF MEDICAL CARE 30-37, 58-61 (1986); The Hippocratic ethic of undivided loyalty to patients, operating in conjunction with insurance coverage for most medical expenditures, obliges treating physicians to take little or no account of costs, reinforcing the taboo against rationing. Some contend that the necessity of rationing justifies permitting doctors to depart from this ethic by withholding care with comparatively low expected benefits even though insurance contracts do not explicitly countenance this and patients expect their doctors to do all they can (so long as expected benefits outweigh expected harm, See, e.g, Hall, supra note 141, at 497.1 have cautioned that this puts patient trust at too great a risk, with worrisome implications for medicine's effectiveness and ability to contribute to people's sense of security and solidarity. M. Gregg Bloche, Trust and Betrayal in the Medical Marketplace, 55 STAN. L. REV. 919, 941 2002; As Elhauge points out, many academics, as well, take the absolutist view, refusing to countenance either health-health trade-offs or the weighing of clinical benefits against costs on the ground that we should shift public resources from other programs (for example, the military) to medicine and health. Elhauge, supra note 225, at 1460-61; This reference to the balancing of benefits against costs is meant to include health-health trade-offs (that is, choices from among alternative uses of health care resources) within a limited budget, as well as decisions as to whether the expected benefits of a test or treatment justify spending additional dollars to cover it; The Supreme Court's conceptualization of independent review of coverage denials as akin to a second medical opinion, not a matter of contract interpretation, see Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v.

ROBINSON, THE CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE 35-62 (1999) (discussing the reasons why a system of competing, vertically integrated health plans did not arise, and describing the decentralized, rapidly shifting contractual relationships among hospitals, doctors, and plans that developed in its stead); There are exceptions, large multispecialty group practices have gained substantial market shares in California, New Jersey, North Carolina, and elsewhere, id. at 8, but medical practice remains a cottage industry in most locales; See Kristin Madison, Hospital Mergers in an Era of Quality Improvement, 7 Hous.

See Fast Facts About Kaiser Permanente, supra note 250; Managed care has always been a misnomer. Even during the height of the managed care era, through the mid-1990s, health plans did not manage doctors, if by manage, one means rigorous oversight and direction of their performance with an eye toward standardizing their approaches to diagnosis and treatment. At most, health plans declined to cover some tests and treatments, refused to authorize some referrals, and profiled doctors' clinical spending patterns with an eye toward selecting more frugal providers for their networks. Plans made minimal proactive efforts: they neither promulgated their own comprehensive, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines nor pressed their participating physicians to follow guidelines developed by academic or professional leaders; Crossley, M., Infected Judgment: Legal Responses to Physician Bias, 48 (2003) VILL.

See generally Welcome to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, http://www.nice.org.uk (last visited Mar. 20,2009); It would also be helpful for this agency or program to develop alternative analytic frameworks, or models, for: (1) the balancing of benefits against costs and (2) the weighing of health benefits against each other (more relevant for health plans and providers that must make do within fixed budgets, Private and public insurers (and providers) could then try out these models as tools for making allocative decisions in candid, accountable fashion. See BEYOND LEARNED HELPLESSNESS, supra note 41. Insurers and providers might or might not experiment along these lines, and such experiments might or might not catch on. Whether or not medical resource allocation evolves to embrace such models would be decided in emergent fashion. But development and dissemination of these models would widen this potential evolutionary pathway; Physicians, pharmaceutical firms, and medical device manufacturers have done so in the past. See Brownlee, supra note 231; Gray et al, supra note 231, at W3-295 to -297. Those involved in Congressional efforts to ramp up federal support for clinical outcomes research tend toward the view that including statutory language empowering government to perform comparative evaluations of medical interventions and to develop clinical practice protocols would doom legislation to increase funding for outcomes research. Interview with Anonymous Congressional Staff Involved in Developing Outcomes Research Legislation Dec. 2006, And indeed the S$1.1 billion appropriated for comparative effectiveness research in February 2009, see supra note 281, was conditioned on the requirement that the interagency council responsible for coordinating this research not mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer or issue ""; By traditional policy design perspective, I refer here to approaches that envision a desired end state and call for reforms meant to bring about this state, rather than to create conditions for the future evolution of policy solutions. See supra text accompanying notes 202-03; Among the actors that might make use of a surge in outcomes data to compare treatments and craft protocols are medical academics, health plans, and insurers. The risk of bias in the development of protocols is omnipresent (as it would be were these same actors to participate in the formulation of government-sponsored protocols, The important subject of the management of conflicts of interest (for example, medical academics' relationships with drug companies, as well as their income from providing questionable treatments) is beyond my scope here; Within the last few years, clinical outcomes studies have made headlines by finding that commonly prescribed treatments increase risks to life.

The term reasonable has been construed by some commentators to permit consideration of cost; others have read this provision more restrictively. E.g., Fox, supra note 299, at 584-95. Because Medicare has never explicitly balanced costs against benefits when promulgating national coverage rules, its authority to do so has not been litigated; America's Health Insurance Plans, the principal trade association representing private health plans, is combining clinical data from multiple plans, and from Medicare, to make it possible to assess the performance of hospitals and physicians nationwide on agreed-on measures of health care quality. This aggregation of data will surmount a major obstacle to measurement of provider performance: the fact that providers report clinical data (for billing purposes) to multiple health plans, none of which, therefore, can assemble a complete picture of how well providers fare on quality measures. A consortium of health care industry stakeholders (including insurers, hospitals, group medical practices, and professional and trade associations) known as the National Quality Forum will formulate quality measures, including standards of care for common medical problems, that will then be applied to the aggregated data to assess health care providers' performance. The results of these assessments w; Private health plans are beginning to collaborate with doctors and hospitals to develop standardized methods for tracking and comparing different providers' costs for tests and treatments. Id. The avowed aim of this collaboration among stakeholders is to support patients, and payers, efforts to shop for the least expensive (that is, most cost-effective) way to achieve a given therapeutic result. Id. But the collaborators in this endeavor, so far, have refrained from explicitly balancing benefits against costs when formulating quality-of-care benchmarks; Interlocking consortia of private health plans, hospitals, medical specialty societies, and other health care industry stakeholders have formed over the past several years for the avowed purpose of reaching industry-wide agreement on the adoption and uses of quality-of-care benchmarks. These include the AQA alliance (focusing on physician care, the Hospital Quality Alliance (HQA, focusing on hospital care, and the Quality Alliance Steering Committee (meant to coordinate the efforts of the AQA alliance and HQA, See Press Release, AQA, Health Care Quality Leaders Join Forces July 21, 2006, available at See also generally AQA-HQA Collaboration-Quality Alliance Steering Committee, last visited Mar. 20, 2009, The Department of Health and Human Services has participated in these consortia and indicated its intention to coordinate Medicare and private sector quality improvement efforts; Health care reform proposals urged by President Bush and by Republican and Democratic candidates for the presidency in 2008 presented additional emergent possibilities. The consumer- directed model, see supra notes 213-14, 229, advanced by the Bush administration and by Republican presidential candidates Rudolph Giuliani and Mitt Romney, would make insured patients more sensitive both to cost in general and to insurance contract provisions designed to encourage patients to seek care from providers who score high on performance measures. For example, a consumer-directed health plan might require a patient to pay much more out-of-pocket for diabetes or heart disease care from a doctor who scores below some threshold on relevant quality-of-care measures. If and when quality measures come to incorporate cost-benefit trade-offs, this tiering of insurance coverage, tied to provider performance, would strengthen doctors' and patients' incentives to accept these trade-offs; Analogously, the insurance exchanges proposed by President Obama and by candidates Hillary Clinton and John Edwards, see text accompanying notes 215-18, would require health plans to report their performance on quality-of-care benchmarks in order to sell coverage on these exchanges. If and when cost-benefit trade-offs are built into these quality measures, this prerequisite for market access would become a powerful lever for adoption of cost-conscious treatment protocols; Whether such barriers are real or merely perceived is unclear. Leaders in academic medicine's efforts to improve health care quality believe that antitrust law stands in the way. Mongan et al, supra note 272, at 3-5. Collaborative setting of standards for purposes of collecting and sharing data has raised antitrust issues in other industries, but antitrust law has been open to arguments about the pro-competitive impact of network economics. Medical antitrust law scholars who have considered this question tend toward the view that current antitrust doctrine poses no obstacles to industry collaboration on outcomes research.

Alternative legal approaches include looking to procedural fairness as a surrogate for inquiry into whether standard setting is anticompetitive as a substantive matter and, in the extreme, outright rejection of industry-wide clinical practice protocols and other quality standards as anticompetitive; Some market-oriented commentators hold a sharply different view. They question such standard setting, arguing that industry-wide adoption of medical practice protocols and other quality norms is contrary to the letter and spirit of antitrust law because it prevents competing providers and health plans from marketing multiple tiers of quality.

Through the mid-twentieth century, most commentators on health care law and policy believed that doctors' scientific knowledge and patient-centered ethics ensured that (barring negligence) they would exercise medical judgment to which society, including the legal system, should defer. Kenneth Arrow captured this set of assumptions in his oft-cited 1963 article contending that physicians promise patient-centeredness to the public in order to win trust, and business, in the face of patients' inability to evaluate the effectiveness of medical care. Arrow assumed, with undue optimism, it turned out, that physicians did know how well their tests and treatments worked, and that they largely delivered on their promise to abjure economic incentives to act contrary to the interests of their patients. Arrow, supra note 85, at 965-66; See supra, , text accompanying notes 230-40; See supra, , text accompanying notes 33-35; Commentators have borrowed the term moral hazard from the casualty insurance context to convey the impact of insurance on medical spending. I have elsewhere questioned the analogy between increased risk taking by people with fire or auto insurance and increased health spending by people with medical insurance, Bloche, supra note 11, at 260-66, but it is plain that medical insurance promotes overspending on health services, relative to people's other wants and needs; CTR.

Henry, Annotation, Necessity of Expert Evidence to Support an Action for Malpractice Against a Physician or Surgeon, 81 A.L.R. 2d 597, 608 (1962); Legal tests for professional acceptance vary by jurisdiction: formulations in wide use include the requirement that a standard of care be upheld by a consensus of opinion among physicians, that it be adhered to by the ordinary practitioner, that it be followed by at least a respectable minority of physicians, and that it be what a reasonable and prudent doctor would undertake under similar circumstances. See Jackson v. Burnham, 39 P. 577, 580 (Colo. 1895, Wjhen a particular mode of treatment is upheld by a consensus of opinion among the members of the profession, it should be followed by the ordinary practitioner; and if a physician sees fit to experiment with some other mode, he should do so at his peril, Boyanton v.

POL'Y & L. 327, 339-41 (2001) (discussing judicial reluctance to give clinical practice protocols greater weight than expert testimony concerning professional custom); A trial judge can do so, of course, by determining that one or the other side's expert has stated the correct standard of care as a matter of law that is, no reasonable juror could conclude otherwise; Mello, M.M., Of Swords and Shields: The Role of Clinical Practice Guidelines in Medical Malpractice Litigation, 149 (2001) U. PA. L. REV, 645, p. 666; Although considerable research has addressed the impact of damage caps, shortened statutes of limitations, and other much-debated reforms on the incidence of malpractice suits and the size and frequency of settlements and awards, no study has decisively addressed the influence of clinical practice protocols on these variables; For a review of the possibilities, see Mello, supra note 327; Strictly speaking, scientists can never say that their hypotheses are proven by experiments; they can only judge that a hypothesis has not been disproven. KARL POPPER, THE LOGIC OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY 10 (Routledge 2d ed. 2002) (1935). In practice, though, researchers treat a hypothesis as established when a sufficient number and variety of experiments (sufficiency here is a normative judgment) yield data consistent with that hypothesis; See supra, , text accompanying notes 237-40; Use of a more-probable-than-not standard here reflects the reality that a clinician must decide, one way or the other. Since a decision must be made, any guidance with more than a 50 percent prospect of being right is useful. Judicial assessment of whether the factual premises undergirding a protocol are more probable than not will call for inquiry into both the reasoning behind them and the extent to which they are accepted by the research community. This is a demanding endeavor, but no more so than is the assessment required when courts engage in evidentiary gatekeeping under Daubert. Cassandra H. Welch, Note, Flexible Standards, Deferential Review: Daubert's Legacy of Confusion, 29 HARV. J.L. & PUB.

Id. at; Government agencies have, on occasion, been forthright about these premises without unleashing popular backlash. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) basing of its aviation safety rulemaking on dollar values for lives lost and degrees of injury inflicted is illustrative. See GRA INC, ECONOMIC VALUES FOR FAA INVESTMENT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS: A GUIDE § 2-2 (2004, available at http://www.faa.gov/ regulations-policies/policy-guidance/benefit-cost/media/050404% 20Critical%20Values%20Dec%2031%20Report%2007Jan05.pdf. Popular backlash admittedly will be more likely if such dollar values are built into clinical practice protocols, since medical care (unlike FAA and other health and safety regulation) involves identified lives; See supra, , text accompanying notes 253-61; See supra notes 301-03; See supra note 302; See supra, , text accompanying notes 303-04; Many such mechanisms have been proposed, including public opinion surveys, focus groups, presentation of hypothetical decisionmaking scenarios to research subjects, and elegant formulae that take account of data derived from these sources. So far, none of these approaches has gained institutional purchase, a reality that reflects our national unwillingness to acknowledge cost-benefit and health-health trade-offs in medical care; See supra note 308; This veil, in truth, is translucent, not opaque. Chronic disease, genetic and behavioral risk factors, and other health information known to consumers when they purchase medical coverage reduce their inclinations to economize on some kinds of care, the care they anticipate needing; From an Olympian social welfare perspective, such a fuzzy compromise is unsatisfactory: the perspective of the consumer who economizes from behind the medical veil of ignorance is preferable. But as a practical matter, the perspective of the sick person in need will always have countervailing power: our hard-wired empathy (and the politics of social solidarity) will have a great deal of influence on the clinical practice norms adopted by physicians and the law. Cf. Bloche, supra note 11, at 272 (discussing compromise between patients' perspectives on health care resource allocation before and after the onset of illness); By evidence-based here, I do not mean scientific proof that measures up to Daubert standards of admissibility (an unrealistically high prerequisite, since comparative-effectiveness research cannot anticipate and keep pace with every potential exception to established protocols). A more pragmatic approach would be to require evidence sufficient to show that a prudent physician would, more probably than not, have departed from the protocol under the circumstances. Sharpening this test is a task beyond the scope of this Article. Doing so will be complicated by the tension between aspirations to make medical care more science based and more responsive to individual differences; See supra, , text accompanying notes 114,273-74; There are numerous open questions within the interstices of this proposition. These include whether health plans (which typically contract with many hospitals and physicians but do not exercise managerial control over them) should share in such liability, whether hospitals should ever share responsibility for their staff physicians' negligent treatment of outpatients (courts have thus far said no), and how liability should be distributed among clinical caregivers and institutions (especially hospitals) with system-wide responsibility. Developing rich responses to these questions is beyond the scope of this Article; E.g., PAUL C. WEILER, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ON TRIAL 114 (1991); Organizations that integrate health care financing, physician services, and hospital care would be best situated (and most motivated) to adopt systems approaches to patient safety and medical care quality in response to enterprise liability. For an early, comprehensive argument on behalf of enterprise liability for medical malpractice, see Kenneth S. Abraham & Paul C. Weiler, Enterprise Medical Liability and the Evolution of the American Health Care System, 108 HARV. l. REV. 381,415- 20 (1994) (preferring hospitals to health insurers as objects of enterprise liability); In theory (from a Coasean perspective, the degree of fragmentation should make no difference: industry actors should bargain toward allocations of liability to the lowest-cost risk avoiders, regardless of starting point (or default) liability rules. In practice, this classic story breaks down in the health care industry for many reasons. These include the transaction costs involved in such bargaining (among vast numbers of actors, the difficulty of pinpointing lowest-cost risk avoiders when risk is the product of collective efforts by independent industry actors (for example, multiple specialists in separate practices who treat the same patient, and cultural factors for example, doctors' reluctance to forgo professional autonomy by acceding to hospitals' or health plans' supervisory authority in exchange for avoidance of the threat of liability; Thus the choice of default liability rules matters greatly in health care. And in our fragmented system, hospitals and health plans generally lack the supervisory authority or bargaining leverage necessary to respond to enterprise liability's incentives by obliging physicians to adopt state-of-the-art systems approaches to medical care. See supra text accompanying notes 264-73; Gerard F. Anderson et al., Health Spending in the United States and the Rest of the Industrialized World, 24 HEALTH AFF. 903, 910 (2005) (The cost of defending U.S. malpractice claims, including awards, legal costs, and underwriting costs, was an estimated S$6.5 billion in 2001 - 0.46 percent of total health spending.); Moreover, as a practical matter, doctors, hospitals, and health plans strongly oppose enterprise liability. Doctors equate giving up the right to be sued, as one put it, with surrendering their authority and autonomy to insurance or hospital bureaucrats, while hospitals and health plans fear that jurors will see them as deep pocket[s]. Randall R. Bovbjerg & Robert Berenson, Enterprise Liability in the Twenty-First Century, in MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND THE U.S. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, supra note 311, at 219,230-31; The legal foundations for such a duty are already in place. Since the mid-1960s, courts have held that hospitals have duties to take reasonable care in reviewing the credentials of staff physicians (including those who are independent contractors rather than employees) and monitoring doctors' and nurses' ongoing performance. Lee J. Dunn, Jr., Hospital Corporate Liability: The Trend Continues, MEDICOLEGAL NEWS, Oct. 1980, at 16, 16. Updating this duty to encompass adoption of systems approaches to quality improvement would be a small doctrinal step; Organizations subject to this duty would include health plans, hospitals, group medical practices, and all others in position to reduce the risk of error by adopting systems approaches; See COMM. ON QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE IN AM., INST, OF MED., supra note 4, at 61-62; Any such extension of institutional liability should be accompanied by empirical study of both its costs and its impact on the incidence of error; Some advocates of minimally regulated medical markets assert otherwise, contending that courts' lack of deference to insurers' coverage denials is a large obstacle to health care cost containment. See, e.g., HAVIGHURST, supra note 11, at 115. They are right about judges' lack of deference, but in my view, judges' attitudes toward nay-saying by health plans reflect our society's unwillingness to tolerate the withholding of beneficial care. See supra note 308; To be sure, health insurance contracts also contain a wide array of specific exclusions and limitations; for example, no coverage for cosmetic surgical procedures and limited numbers of psychotherapy sessions per year. Legal disputes over these exclusions and limitations are much less common than are disputes over medical necessity. One type of exclusion, though, does occasion considerable conflict, noncoverage for investigational or experimental treatments. See, e.g, Elsroth v. Consol. Edison Co, 10 F. Supp. 2d 427,440 (S.D.N.Y. 1998, denying the insured's motion for a preliminary injuction requiring the defendant-insurer to precertify high-dose chemotherapy treatment because it was deemed experimental, Watts v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co, 892 F. Supp. 737, 746 W.D.N.C. 1995, denying the insured's motion for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction preventing the insurer from declining to cover autologous bone-marrow; See supra, , note 89 and accompanying text; See supra, pp. 99-101. , 121 and accompanying text; These disputes present as breach-of-contract cases when patients (or providers) sue insurers to obtain payment after care has been provided or to secure preauthorization of payment in order to proceed with treatment. They present as tort cases when refusal to preauthorize care has led to denial of care, resulting (allegedly) in injury. ERISA preempts these state law claims when employers provide coverage. But patients with employment-based coverage can obtain payment for care under ERISA after prevailing in state-level independent medical review proceedings. Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U.S. 355, 359 (2002); This deference to long-standing expectations reflects: (1) appreciation of the fact that people buy medical coverage (and other kinds of insurance) in large part for the sense of security that it offers and (2) acknowledgment that most insurance subscribers have no role in the drafting or negotiation of the specific provisions of insurance policies. This accords with insurance law's special regard for the reasonable expectations of the insured. See generally Kenneth S. Abraham, Judge-Made Law and Judge-Made Insurance: Honoring the Reasonable Expectations of the Insured, 67 VA. L. REV. 1151 1981, discussing the justifications for the expectations principle; Clarity about health plan terms that depart from consumer expectations requires more than the use of language readily accessible to the average person: plan marketing procedures should ensure that such terms are communicated to potential subscribers in vivid, high-visibility fashion. Coverage exclusions, in particular, should be conveyed in concrete language, perhaps accompanied by examples of tests and treatments covered or excluded under common circumstances. Bloche, supra note 11, at 316; Id. The FAA's explicit valuation of life - and of several levels of injury and disability - in dollar terms, GRA INC., supra note 334, offers one model for such clarity. As with other limits on medical coverage that depart from consumer expectations, see supra note 361, such valuations - and how they are to be incorporated into clinical protocols - should be presented clearly, in vivid, high- visibility fashion, in health plan marketing materials, not merely in the small print of insurance contracts; Health plans should also be clear in their contracts about how the protocols they adopt treat scientific uncertainty concerning the efficacy of tests and treatments. Do they, for example, rely on best estimates of efficacy by protocol drafters (including leading researchers in a specialty), or do they reject tests and treatments outright when these have not yet been shown scientifically to work? If plans take the latter, more aggressive course, they should advise consumers in plain language that many therapies in wide use lack scientific proof of efficacy and thus will not be covered. Bloche, supra note 11, at 316. An in-between course that plans could take is to cover widely used clinical measures based on best estimates of efficacy by protocol drafters, but to insist on scientific evidence of efficacy for new clinical interventions; To require that they be set out in full in health insurance contracts could turn these contracts into multivolume medical treatises, hardly a way to make them understandable to subscribers; It should suffice for protocol developers to state the cost-benefit trade-off rules on which protocols rely. The industry-wide protocol development collaborations now getting underway, see supra notes 301, 303, offer an opportunity in this regard: each collaboration could adopt a common cost-benefit trade-off standard for the protocols it adopts. This would enable health plans to adopt packages of protocols that rest on compatible trade-offs - trade-offs that are also consistent with the resource allocation principles articulated in plans' contracts with subscribers; See supra, , notes 301, 303; Market forces will drive health plans and providers to eschew such limits, as the late 1990s backlash against managed-care organizations' rationing methods illustrates. See supra text accompanying notes 227-29; Put differently, our anchoring heuristic for the health care we expect is the medical technology currently available. People alive at the dawn of the twentieth century did not take umbrage at the unavailability of antibiotics (which did not appear until the 1930s). Similarly, we do not bristle today because the gene therapies of the future are not yet on pharmacists' shelves; See generally CUTLER, supra note 65 reviewing health services research that has identified tests and treatments worth paying for; See Nicole Kresge, Robert D. Simoni & Robert L. Hill, 30 Years of Cholesterol Metabolism: The Work of Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, 281 J. BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY e25 (2006); The statin medications work by inhibiting an enzyme that catalyzes one of the steps in cholesterol synthesis. This reduces the level of low-density lipoproteins (so-called bad cholesterol) in the blood, which, in turn, slows, stops, and under some conditions reverses the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Dominic S. Ng, The Role of Statins in Oxidative Stress and Cardiovascular Disease, 5 CARDIOVASCULAR & HAEMATOLOGICAL DISORDERS, DRUG TARGETS 165 2005; LEWIS THOMAS, THE LIVES OF A CELL, 34 (L), p. 974; When I characterize their benefits as modest, I mean modest in the aggregate, relative to cost. Such technologies do, in some cases, add years to people's lives and diminish suffering and disability. Examples include angioplasty during the first twelve hours after a heart attack, Albert Schomig et al, Mechanical Reperfusion in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction Presenting More than 12 Hours from Symptom Onset, 293 JAMA 2865, 2869-71 (2005, finding that angioplasty within twelve to forty-eight hours from symptom onset can positively affect long-term outcomes, and replacement of severely arthritic hips and knees with artificial joints, NIH Consensus Dev.

J. MED, 881. , finding that despite the fact that both consume the same resource inputs, invasive procedures tend to be compensated at more than double the rate of evaluation-and-management services; Hospitals can also profit handsomely from these technologies, which due to economies of scale and close proximity of complementary inpatient services, are often hospital based. But doctors' incentives have a much greater influence on their rate of adoption, since doctors are the key decisionmakers; An example is the prescription of statins, based on advances in our understanding of cholesterol metabolism, see supra note 370, to treat or prevent buildup of atherosclerotic plaque in blood vessels. Pharmaceutical firms, of course, can benefit greatly from the sale of drugs, so long as they remain patent protected, but they cannot ethically or legally share these revenue streams with prescribing doctors. The cardiologist who evaluates a patient, then prescribes a statin along with, perhaps, a few other medications might be able to bill a few or several hundred dollars. The cardiologist who spends the same time performing an angioplasty with placement of a stent might be able to collect a few or several thousand dollars; In most regions, individual health plans lack sufficient market share to impose such cutbacks without losing large numbers of specialists and thereby diminishing their ability to compete. Antitrust law, of course, keeps plans from colluding to dictate such cuts; See supra note 297; See supra, , text accompanying notes 279-86; Firms that develop and manufacture halfway technologies are likely to join in this opposition; New legislation, sure to be resisted by specialty societies, would be necessary to empower CMS, the federal agency that runs Medicare, to do so. CMS is currently required by statute to set fees based on the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) methodology, a species of cost-of- service rate making. RBRVS incorporates physician effort and training costs but disregards therapeutic value. 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-4(a, 2000, RBRVS, enacted in 1989, was itself an improvement over the physician payment methodology enacted upon Medicare's creation in 1965, the reasonable-charge formula (which set payments to doctors based on the physician-charge schedules prevailing in a region, thereby inviting doctors to raise their fees as quickly as the market would bear, See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-239, §6102, 103 Stat. 2106, 2169. RBRVS achieved modest reductions in some specialists' fees (10 to 20 percent in some cases) a; See Steven Shavell & Tanguy van Ypersele, Rewards Versus Intellectual Property Rights, 44 J.L. & ECON. 525, 525-26 (2001) (arguing that giving innovators a choice between intellectual property rights and a reward system under which innovations would immediately enter the public domain is superior to merely conferring intellectual property rights); Id. at 526; The possibilities for conflict are much enhanced by the subjectivity inherent in selection of medical outcome measures. As is the case for selection of outcome measures by comparative-effective researchers, see supra text accompanying notes 235-36, and adoption of quality-of-care benchmarks for the purpose of comparing provider performance, see supra text accompanying notes 300-02, different personal preferences and values are best captured by different measures. There will thus always be room to object to designated metrics of therapeutic advance on the ground that they privilege some patients' concerns while giving short shrift to those of others; They merit further exploration by scholars of intellectual property who are familiar with the dynamics of technological change in health care. That exploration is beyond the scope of this Article, as is consideration of whether likely opposition from drug and device makers renders these ideas politically implausible; The term ragged edges is Daniel Callahan's, meant to capture the truth that however far our biological understandings of disease advance, and however quickly we devise effective therapies based on these understandings, there will always be a frontier zone of biological ignorance and minimally effective tests and treatments.

The paper aims to review the process of conducting the project, how it was implemented afterwards and how it compares to other national technology foresight projects&Design/methodology/ approach - Through a literature search, a process framework was conducted. The analysis was then conducted in four phases. First a process review, second a comparative review, third content review and finally a post project review. Expert interviews and site visits to Turkish State Planning Organization and TUBITAK (Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey) helped the authors to collect the data on Vision 2023 including how it was established, which areas were involved and what the recommendations were. Finally an expert panel was organized as part of a recent Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology. This included experts involved in the project as well as leading researchers who have been analyzing this project. This panel helped to validate the results. Findings - Processes used in the Turkish project were similar to the other national projects, however lack of political ownership and change in leadership had been blocking the recommendations coming out of this project from being implemented. A second effort is required to modify the results of the first one and to establish political ownership and leadership. Several other national projects had multiple rounds before solid actions were taken. Industry needs to be a part of the effort as the panelists indicated that several key corporations were missing in the first project. Practical implications - The project provides comparative details on running national technology foresight projects. This should be useful for those responsible for planning similar projects. Original/value - The paper reviews the project implementation process and what happened after the implementation providing feedback on what should have been done or should be done in similar foresight projects. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Governments have preferences, which give much weight to the living generations, and they cannot commit themselves to future taxes and transfers, which will be decided by future governments with different objectives. The economy follows one of two equilibrium paths with perfect foresight. On one path, governments finance the costs of their transfers to the living by increasing public debt recklessly. Consumers pay more and more taxes to finance the cost of this debt, and the successive generations will enter a process of impoverishment. On the other path, in spite of their preference bias, governments borrow less and put the economy on a path of egalitarian consumption flows for the successive generations, with a constant ratio of public debt to national income. The mechanisms, which put an economy on one or the other equilibrium paths, are unconnected to the fundamentals of the model.","Intergenerational transfers; Markov perfect equilibrium; Overlapping-generations model; Time consistent policies","debt; debt crisis; financial provision; future prospect; income distribution; model; policy making; policy reform; tax system; time dependent behavior",,,,,"Azariadis, C., (1993) Intertemporal Macroeconomics, , Blackwell Publishers, Oxford; Cairncross, F., (2004) The Economist; Feldstein, M., (2005); Feldstein, M., Liebman, J., (2002) The Handbook of Public Economics, pp. 2245-2324. , Elsevier Science, Amsterdam; Grossman, G.M., Helpman, E., Intergenerational redistribution with short-lived government (1998) Economic Journal, 108 (450), pp. 1299-1329; Heller, P.S., (2003) Who Will Pay?

This offers comprehensive information for sustainable ecosystem services provision. A foresight process of systematic and presumptive assessment of future state and ecosystem integrity of Lake Victoria basin, as participatory scenario building technique, is presented. Four scenarios have been illustrated as possible future states of the basin over the next twenty years. Using a scenario building model developed in Ventana Simulation (VENSIM®) platform, the paper presents a scenario methodology for tracking changes in lake basin ecosystem status. Plausible trends in land use change, changes in lake levels and contribution of fisheries are presented. This is part of an initial attempt to setup long-term environmental policy planning strategies for Lake Victoria basin. The assumptions, driving forces, impacts and opportunities under each scenario depict major departure and convergence points for an integrated transboundary diagnosis and analysis of regional issues in the basin as well as strategic action planning for long-term interventions. The findings have been presented in terms of temporal, spatial, biophysical and human well-being dimensions. The attempts in this study can be embedded in a policy framework for basin management priority setting and may guide partnerships for environmental management. © 2009 The Authors.","Ecosystem; Human well-being; Lake Victoria; Land use","ecosystem dynamics; environmental policy; freshwater ecosystem; land use change; land use planning; participatory approach; service provision; sustainability; Africa; East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,"Abila, R.O., Odongkara, K., Onyango, P.O., Distribution of economic benefits from the fisheries of Lake Victoria (2006) Proceedings of the 11th World Lake Conference, , In: Eds.

Based on empirical evidence regarding the recent national exercises in the field of science and technology (S&T), as described by the resumes of the European Foresight Monitoring Network, and on in-depth analysis of the Romanian S&T foresight exercise, the paper explores the relevance of the adaptive foresight framework for the extension of foresight functions towards supporting strategic planning. The demand for policy relevant foresight in S&T seems to be stronger in countries with developing knowledge based economies (e.g. new EU member states, Turkey); while in countries with larger foresight tradition the push comes from the improving abilities of foresight practitioners in involving decision-makers. Strongly integrated into strategic planning, the Romanian S&T foresight shows the adaptability characteristics in a restructuring R&D system and further suggests the relevance of multi-level negotiations for transforming consensus into commitment.","Adaptive foresight; Public policy; Research and development (R&D) system; Strategic planning",,,,,,"Agachi, S., Curaj, A., Dumitrache, I., Filip, F., Popa, G., Stǎnciulescu, I., Szabolcs l, Editura Academiei Române (2005) Sistemul Naţional de Cercetare, Dezvoltare şi Inovare în Contextual Integrǎrii în Aria Europeanǎ a Cercetǎrii, , (coord); Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Scapalo, F., The Impact of Foresight on Policy-Making: Insights from the ForLearn Mutual Learning Process (2006) IPTS, Technology Analysis & Strategic Management; Eriksson, E.A., Weber, K.M., Adaptive Foresight: Navigating the Complex Landscape of Policy Strategies (2008) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 75 (2008), pp. 462-482; Gavigan, J.P., Scapalo, F., Keenan, M., Miles, I., Farhl, F., Lecoq, D., Capriati, M., Di, B.T., (2001) Foresight for Regional Development Network, , IPTSPREST-CM International - Sviluppo Italia; Mahroum, S., Blackman, C., Swedish Technology Foresight 2004, , EFMN, EFMN Foresight Brief No. 2; Mahroum, S., Danish Technology Foresight 2015, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 5; Damvakeraki, T., Greek National Technology Foresight 2021, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 12; Damvakeraki, T., FORETECH - Bulgarian Technology and Innovation Foresight 2015, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 028; Łepeta, M., The Polish Foresight Pilot - Health and Living 2013, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 038; Cuhls, K., Japanese S & T Foresight 2035, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 035; Saritas, O., S & T Vision 2023, , EFMN, (Turkey) Foresight Brief No. 039; Stanovnik, P., Kos, M., Technology Foresight Slovenia 2020, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 071; Yegorov, I., Ukrainian STI 2025, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 074; Gaponenko, N., Russian Nanotechnology 2020, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 075; Sokolov, A., Russian Critical Technologies 2015, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 079; Giesecke, S., (2007) Austria's Futures: Past Perspectives and Present Expectations, , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 118; Sacio-Szymańska, A., Kuciński, J., National Foresight Programme ""Poland 2020"", , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 121; Rasmussen, B., Andersen, D., Technology Foresight on Cognition and Robotics, , EFMN, (Denmark) Foresight Brief No. 125; Klusacek, K., Kucera, Z., Kadlecikova, K., Third Czech National Research Programme (2009-2014), , EFMN, Foresight Brief No. 128; http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide/0_home/index.htm, FOR-LEARN Online Foresight Guide, JRC, European Commision; Leydesdorff, L., (2003) A Sociological Theory of Communication.

As a foresight concept, ""wild cards"" refer to trend-breaking/trend-creating events that are very hard or even impossible to anticipate, but that should nonetheless be expected in complex and fast-evolving environments. The discussion is grounded in the experience obtained in two strategic foresight projects carried out in two industries - civil aviation and investment banking. The unique strength of these cases is that they constitute concrete and rare examples of disclosed business foresight studies that, from the start, included an explicit wild card element. Most interestingly, both of these cases are analytically linked to the September 11 event, a severe instance of a wild card. A key rationale for wild card-friendly foresight research is that it is a source of critical inputs for the generation of robust decisions precisely when the organisation is under pressure from unexpected dramatic strategic discontinuities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This article discusses the history of the USA in the light of Norbert Elias's theory of civilizing (and decivilizing) processes. Although, unlike many Western European countries, the USA never had a single monopoly 'model-setting elite' and had no nobility, it did have several competing aristocracies. The Northern BildungsbA1/4rgertum dominates perception of the USA at the expense of the Southern Junkers, whose political and cultural legacy nevertheless continues to be of great significance, notably in the comparatively high level of violence that afflicts present-day America. The peculiarities of state formation processes ĝ€"" the formation of a (relatively) effective monopoly of the legitimate use of violence ĝ€"" in the USA and their continuation in empire formation are examined. Ironically, the USA has become a model-setting elite for the whole world at a time when its popular egalitarianism represents a kind of false consciousness in a factually increasingly unequal society; when the USA may be undergoing a process of de-democratization; and when American misperceptions of the wider world, together with diminishing foresight by American governments, are becoming a serious problem in world politics. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","American exceptionalism; Civilizing processes; Elias; Elites; Empire; Violence",,,,,,"Atkinson, A.B., Piketty, T., (2007) Top Incomes over the Twentieth Century: A Contrast between English-speaking and European Countries, , Oxford : Oxford University Press; Jo, B., Gregg, P., MacHin, S., (2005) 'Intergenerational Mobility in Europe and North America'.

Moreover, it fails to be fully Pareto optimal and incentive compatible and is also not implementable as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium of an extensive form game (Glycopantis et al. in Econ Theory 26:765-791, 2005). The lack of all the above properties is mainly due to the fact that the agents are supposed to predict the equilibrium market clearing price (as agent's expected maximized utility is conditioned on the information that equilibrium prices reveal), which leads inevitably to the presumption that agents know all the primitives in the economy, i.e., random initial endowments, random utility functions and private information sets. To get around this problematic equilibrium notion, we introduce a new concept called Bayesian-Walrasian equilibrium (BWE) which has Bayesian features. In particular, agents try to predict the market-clearing prices using Bayesian updating and evaluate their consumption in terms of Bayesian price estimates, which are different for each individual. In this framework agents maximize expected utility conditioned on their own private information about the state of nature, subject to a Bayesian estimated budget constraint. Market clearing is not an intrinsic part of the definition of BWE. However, both in the case of perfect foresight and in the case of symmetric information BWE leads to a statewise market clearing; it then becomes an ex post Walrasian equilibrium allocation. This new BWE exists under standard assumptions, in contrast to the REE. In particular, we show that our new BWE exists in the well-known example in Kreps (J Econ Theory 14:32-43, 1977), where REE fails to exist. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Bayesian Walrasian expectations equilibrium; Rational expectations equilibrium",,,,,,"Aliprantis, C.D., Tourky, R., Yannelis, N.C., A theory of value with non linear prices (2001) J Econ Theory, 100, pp. 22-72; Debreu, G., (1959) Theory of Value, , Wiley New York; Glycopantis, D., Muir, A., Yannelis, N.C., Non-implementation of rational expectations as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (2005) Econ Theory, 26, pp. 765-791; Glycopantis, D., Yannelis, N.C., (2007) On Non-revealing Rational Expectations Equilibrium, , University of Illinois; Glycopantis, D., Yannelis, N.C., Equilibrium concepts in differential information economies (2005) Differential Information Economies.

A plethora of host defensive systems have evolved to counteract and/or eliminate invading pathogens. These strategies exert selection pressure upon the pathogen, leading to the emergence of mechanisms to combat the host including immune evasion and resistance. Consequently, effective control of rapidly evolving diseases is contingent on the ability to predict pathogen evolution prior to the emergence of resistant phenotypes. Highlighted in this article is a bacteriophage-based technology capable of screening hundreds of millions of binding events simultaneously at single molecule resolution, thus providing an in vitro mimetic of protein evolution. This technology, termed phage escape, can be utilized to model the evolution of proteins in the presence of antibodies or other selective pressure, providing a predictive solution to the coevolution of antigens and the immune system. Foresight into the evolutionary path of an antigen and subsequent neutralization strategies can facilitate more efficacious vaccination formulation and have important implications in the treatment of a range of evolving diseases, including viral infections and cancer. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"antibody; hemagglutinin; peptide library; protein; article; bacteriophage; biological model; cell free system; chemistry; directed molecular evolution; human; immune system; influenza; metabolism; methodology; molecular evolution; mutagenesis; phenotype; Antibodies; Bacteriophages; Cell-Free System; Directed Molecular Evolution; Evolution, Molecular; Hemagglutinins; Humans; Immune System; Influenza, Human; Models, Biological; Mutagenesis; Peptide Library; Phenotype; Proteins",,"hemagglutinin, 37333-12-3; protein, 67254-75-5; Antibodies; Hemagglutinins; Peptide Library; Proteins",,,"Burton, D.R., Stanfield, R.L., Wilson, I.A., (2005) Proc.

It is a systematic approach for looking into the long-term futures. E-government initiatives are currently at a stage of integration and new orientation in developing countries. Smaller steps of government modernization have in part been successfully implemented; larger ones still lie ahead of us. This demands a framework for e-government foresight studies. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for the e-government foresight. Firstly, the main components of foresight from different foresight frameworks were identified using meta-synthesis approach. Then, expert's opinion about identified components are collected and validated. The e-government foresight framework was proposed based on the Zachman architecture framework. Finally, appropriate activities and methods for conducting each stages of the framework are summarized. The implications of the results addressed a range of main issues such as dedicated framework, increased internal communication and knowledge sharing, and enhanced project management effectiveness. © 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","E-government; Foresight; Framework; Zachman","Developing countries; Network function virtualization; Project management; Architecture frameworks; Conceptual frameworks; E-governments; Foresight; Framework; Internal communications; Management effectiveness; Zachman; Government data processing",,,,,"Yildiz, M., E-government research: Reviewing the literature, limitations, and ways forward (2007) Government Information Quarterly, 24, pp. 646-665; Ndou, V., E-Government for developing countries: Opportunities and challenges (2004) EJISDC, 18 (1), pp. 1-24; Martin, B.R., Foresight in Science and Technology (1995) Technology Foresight & Strategic Management, 7 (2), pp. 139-168; Popper, R., (2007) The Foresight process (Main Phases & Common Steps), , PREST - Institute of Innovation Research, The University of Manchester; Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., (2007) Technical Report on a foresight Training Course, , European Communities; UPGRADE (2004) Foresight Strategy and Actions to Aassist Regions of Traditional Industry Towards a More Knowledge Based Community, , Community Research of European Commission, Dissemination Conference Brussels; Unido, (2005) UNIDO Technology Foresight Manual: Organization and Methods, Vienna, 1; Miles, I., Keenan, M., Basic Approaches for Technology Foresight at the National and Sub-National Level (2002), International Conference on Technology Foresight for Ukraine; Janssen, M., Scenario building for e-government in 2020: Consolidating the results from regional workshops (2007) Proceedings of the 40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Tegart, G., Johnston, R., Some Advances in the Practice of Foresight (2004) Forecasting & Assessment Methods, , EU-US Seminar: New Technology Foresight, Seville, May; French, S., The challenges of extending the MCDA paradigm to E-democracy (2003) Journal of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, 12, pp. 63-64; Eurgelman, J.C., Et al., E-government in Europe in 2010: Key Policy and Research Challenges (2004) IPTS Workshop, , http://fiste.Jrc.Es, Sevilla, 4-5th March, European Commission Joint Research Center; Giorgi, L., Hauptman, A., Review of Foresight Studies and Emerging Technologies on E-government (2007) E-government for Low Socio-Economic Status Groups, , OECD Website, Egove Foresight.

This will be achieved by applying a new methodology, a FORESIGHT process. In this process, both experts and decision makers from research, industry, policy making, and society are brought together creating channels for communication and assist in this way in the development of a long-term vision and action plan for freight transport in Europe.

Box 611, Dubendorf, CH-8600, Switzerland","Strategic decision making in infrastructure sectors. Participatory foresight and strategic planning for sustainable sanitation Infrastructure sectors in general, and urban water management in particular, have developed over the past couple of decades within the confines of a rather narrow and stable socio-technical regime. Nowadays, these infrastructures are increasingly confronted with uncertain context conditions, a broadened spectrum of technological alternatives and an increasing heterogeneity of value positions. As a consequence, the longterm sustainability of these sectors has been questioned by many commentators. Of particular importance is the way strategic decisions are made. Current approaches tend to block important opportunities for sustainable transformation. It is argued here that a more reflex ive, discursive and participative approach to strategic planning is needed. The paper introduces «Regional Infrastructure Foresight» (RIF) as a method which combines foresight on regional framework conditions with a stakeholder assessment of a broad range of system options. The paper presents the methodology in some detail and discusses the main lessons learned through three empirical applications in the Swiss sanitation sector. Based on these experiences, it is argued that strategic decision making in infrastructures is of high relevance for regional policy and therefore warrants more attention in future research in economic and political geography. © Author(s) 2009.

The «Oil and Gas"" scenario in which the company diversifies its activities on the basis of new services and products. The ""All energies pipeliner"" scenario in which the company extends its activities to the transport of all types of energy.

The European database of patents (espacenet) was used, combining keywords and IPC. The major applicants, countries of publication and uses were mapped. The patent requests collected are mainly distributed in the area of polymers to medical devices and therapeutic methods that utilize cellulose. The results obtained revealed that the US was the main country with studies directed to this technological area (18 patent applications) and the major applicant was the company Micro Therapeutics Inc.

The responsibility is primarily that of educators, although vision and foresight require a co-ordinated approach involving national and international veterinary organisations. Once it is accepted by all parties that change is essential, the implementation will fail unless there is a unified programme involving the schools and colleges, the accrediting agencies, the licensing authorities, governments, the professional organisations and corporate veterinary medicine. All have a role to play, and any one can readily block progress. A unified approach is an absolute requirement.

Intelligence organisations or communities are also increasingly expected to achieve some sort of comprehension of a general situation and the course of specific events. In the best of worlds, this comprehension can be transformed into useful background analysis or warning – whether early or late, specific or general – that something is or might be developing in the domain that the intelligence service is expected to monitor. In the real world, lack of comprehension and, thus, of foresight is a common phenomenon, so common that it now constitutes the dominating theme of intelligence studies. Remove the failures and little is left of what is written about intelligence analysis and its use during the Cold War and beyond. Huge efforts have thus been expended to investigate and ponder why intelligence has been unable to deliver what was rightfully or wrongfully expected from it and to find solutions in terms of intelligence reform, often focused on reorganisation. This failure–investigation–reorganisation cycle has become something of a malaise of early 21st-century Western intelligence. A consensus has emerged on the necessity to transform intelligence and improve its ability to analyse and deliver foresight. However, neither reorganisation nor analytic training is a sufficient answer. The fundamental problem is the implicit model for knowledge production in intelligence systems that have been in place for more than a half-century. © Swedish National Defence College 2009.",,,,,,,"Herman, M., (1996) Intelligence Power in Peace and War, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Treverton, G.F., (2001) Reshaping National Intelligence in the Age of Information, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Manoeuvre, S., (1978) Sovjetiska Östersjömarinen – Landstigning sövning; Kuhn, T.S., (1962) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970, and 1996; Sharrock, W., Read, R., (2002) Kuhn: Philosopher of Scientific Revolution, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Kuhn, T., (2002) A Philosophical History for Our Time, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Heuer, R.J., (1999) Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, , Washington: Center for the Study of Intelligence; Johnston, R., (2005) Analyticculture in the U.S. Intelligence Community: An Ethnographic Study, , Washington: Center for the Study of Intelligence; Wohlstetter, R., (1962) Pearl Harbor:Warning and Decision, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Kam, W.E., (1988) Surprise Attack: The Victim’s Perspective, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Betts, R., (1982) Surprise Attack: Lessons for the Defense Planning, , Washington: Brookings Institute; Bar-Joseph, U., (2005) The Watchman Fell Asleep: The Surprise of Yom Kippur and Its Sources, , New York: State University of New York Press; Herzog, C., (1975) The War of Atonement, , London: Weidenfelt and Nicolson; Kahana, E., Early warning versus concept: The case of the yom kippurwar (2002) Intelligence and National Security, 17 (2). , Summer; Kumaraswamy, P.R., Revisiting the Yom Kippur War, , London: Frank Cass, 2000; Shazli, S.E., (2003) The Crossing of the Suez, , San Francisco: American Mideast Research; Blight And David, J.G., (1998) Welch, Intelligence and the Cubanmissile Crisis, , London: Frank Cass; Wiebes, C., (2003) Intelligence and the War in Bosnia, , M¨unchen: LIT Verlag; London (2006) May, , “Report into the London Terrorist Attacks on 7 July 2005” (Intelligence and Security Committee; Barger, D.G., Towards a Revolution in Intelligence Affairs, p. 2005. , Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation; Hart, D., Simon, S., Thinking straight and talking straight: Problems of intelligence analysis (2006) Survival, 48 (1). , Spring; Moore, D.T., (2006) Critical Thinking and Intelligence Analysis, , Washington: Joint Military Intelligence College, Occasional Paper 14, May",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781139174541; 9780521518574,,,"English","National Intelligence Systems: Current Research and Future Prospects",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919541003

It used a model of disease drivers (social, economic, biological or environmental factors that affect disease outcomes, by changing the behaviour of diseases, sources or pathways) devised for the Foresight Programme in the United Kingdom. Nine families of drivers were adapted to Chinese circumstances and matrices were constructed to identify the likely relationship of single infectious diseases or families of diseases to the drivers. The likely future trends in those drivers in China were determined by interviews with 36 independent Chinese experts. These trends included not only potentially adverse animal and human movements but also opportunities for innovative surveillance methods, more use of hospitals, antimicrobials and vaccines. Some human behaviours and social trends were expected to increase the risk of infections (in particular sexually transmitted and healthcare-associated infections) while at the same time the experts thought the awareness of risk in the Chinese population would increase. The results suggested a number of areas where the Chinese authorities may experience difficulties in the future, such as rising numbers of healthcare-associated infections, zoonoses and other emerging diseases and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV). Not making firm predictions, this work identifies priority disease groups requiring surveillance and consideration of countermeasures as well as recommending strengthening basic surveillance and response mechanisms for unanticipatable zoonoses and other emerging disease threats.",,"animal; article; China; communicable disease; disease transmission; epidemic; forecasting; health survey; human; infection control; methodology; organization and management; risk assessment; risk factor; statistics; Animals; China; Communicable Disease Control; Communicable Diseases; Disease Outbreaks; Forecasting; Humans; Population Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",,,,,,"Nicoll, A.email: Angus.Nicoll@ecdc.europa.eu",,,,,,,,15607917,,,"19589327","English","Euro Surveill.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70249109752

In 2006, the ""Foresight Group"" of the Normandy Chambers of Agriculture carried out an in-depth study of the eating patterns of French people to 2020, the aim of which was to assess the resulting development of agricultural demand. An original feature of this study was the fact that it adopted a viewpoint ""from the field"" rather than ""from the plate"". In other words, its reasoning is based on the global impact on agricultural raw materials, whatever the form taken by the produce consumed (unprocessed or transformed by the agrifood industry) or its place of consumption. After a presentation of the key variables (economic growth, consumer income, public health policies etc.), among which income plays a crucial role, four possible scenarios were proposed. These were a scenario based on current trends, which projects forward the situation we see today; a ""Nordic"" scenario, based on a better economic situation, more egalitarian income-distribution and active health/nutrition policies; a scenario tending toward the U.S. model and, lastly, a crisis scenario against a background of economic stagnation and increased inequality. Each of these scenarios specifies the impact that would ensue in terms of agricultural demand for each broad area of produce. The usefulness of such a study of eating patterns is more than ever confirmed by recent developments, which are tending to tilt the balance, for the moment, towards the crisis scenario.",,,,,,,"Les résultats de cette étude ont été présentés lors du colloque «2020, que mangerons-nous ? », qui s'est tenu à Caen le 5 octobre 2006.

Shortly after China was opened to the outside world in 1978, Dalian officials had the foresight to include tourism in their urban plans. Tourism development has been an integral part of the overall urban development strategy. Environmental enhancement has upgraded the city's image and competitive competence. Multi-functional urban facilities have been constructed, such as conference centres that are aimed at and used by clients with multiple purposes. Tourism is well established in Dalian and has been a means of facilitating urban development rather than an end in itself. In spite of efforts to exert a global presence, the city is currently more influential at the regional rather than the global level.","China; Decision making environment; MICE; Urban tourism","decision making; tourism development; tourism economics; urban development; urban economy; Asia; China; Dalian; Eurasia; Far East; Liaoning",,,,,"Ashworth, G., Tunbridge, J., (1990) The Tourist-Historic City, , London: Belhaven; Bao, J., Gan, M., The Changing Positions of Chinese Urban Tourism Destinations Since the Reform (2005) Urban Tourism: Theories and Case Studies, pp. 53-54. , J.

During these past years, we have been witnessing a number of mobile payment trials based on NFC. Early experiences are already quite encouraging and many expect NFC to become a highly efficient and effective technology for mobile payments. The objective of our research is to evaluate in a systematic manner the potential of NFC as an upcoming technology for mobile payments. In order to ensure the rigor of our research, we used a formal and structured approach based on multi-actor multi-criteria methods. Our research provides one of the first assessment of NFC and a realistic picture of the current Swiss situation as we involved numerous mobile payment experts. Our findings show that Swiss industry experts are quite enthusiastic about the future of NFC. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Market analysis; Mobile payments; NFC; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Balaban, D., Japan's mobile wallets fail to inspire - Yet, card technology (2007), (13-04-2007); Benayoun, R., Roy, B., Sussmann, B., (1966) Manuel De Réference Du Programme Electre, , Note de synthese, formation n.25.

This development followed on the heels of the poet's earlier interest in the socialist, populist, and leftoriented movements and ideas that drove a number of Hungarian artists and young intellectuals of the time. Immersed in social-cultural activities during his university years in Szeged (1930-35), Radnóti underwent a significant change when he moved back to Budapest. He recognized the threat posed by the Third Reich and watched with great consternation the involvement of a number of Hungarian intellectuals and politicians in rightist and anti-Semitic activities and propaganda. Responding to this development, he started to warn of the impending catastrophe and suggest the breakthrough of previously unimaginable forces in the world. Ozsváth's study of Radnóti's work reveals a frequency and intensity of these visions, connoting more than the poet's disagreement with contemporary political developments and his foresight of destruction and mass murder.",,,,,,,"Braham, R.L., (1994) The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary, , New York: Columbia UP; Karády, V., Egyenitlen elmagyarosodás, avagy hogyan vált Magyarország magyarnyelvucombining double acute accent országgá?

It contrasts different approaches to the issue of preparedness from an organisational and social perspective, in two cases where new enterprise-wide business processes were implemented and integrated in different settings. In both cases, the emergence of new systems presented a huge challenge to companies hard-pressed to marshal the resources to mount effective change and implementation projects on this scale. The cases presented enable a comparison of different strategies used, one firm responding to organic growth, and the other to rapid industry-driven change. The chapter focuses not on the implementations per se, but instead on the issue of preparedness for change. The chapter concludes by drawing out general lessons concerning how to support and maintain organisational preparedness for enterprise wide change in different industry settings. © 2009, IGI Global.","Agility; Business processes; Crisis of control; Emergence; Enterprise integration; Foresight; Preparedness","Computer applications; Information systems; Agility; Business Process; Emergence; Enterprise Integration; Foresight; Preparedness; Industrial research",,,,,"Al-Mudimigh, A., Zairi, M., Al-Mashari, M., ERP software implementation: An integrative framework (2001) European Journal of Information Systems, (4), pp. 216-226; Beer, S., (1981) The Brain of the Firm, , Chichester: Wiley; Beer, S., (1985) Diagnosing the System for Organizations, , Chichester: Wiley; Calás, M., Smircich, L., Rewriting gender into organizational theorizing: Directions from feminist perspectives (1992) Rethinking Organization: New Directions in Organizational Theory and Analysis, pp. 227-253. , M.

In this proposal, analogies are derived from elementary information that is extracted rapidly from the input, to link that input with the representations that exist in memory. Finding an analogical link results in the generation of focused predictions via associative activation of representations that are relevant to this analogy, in the given context. Predictions in complex circumstances, such as social interactions, combine multiple analogies. Such predictions need not be created afresh in new situations, but rather rely on existing scripts in memory, which are the result of real as well as of previously imagined experiences. This cognitive neuroscience framework provides a new hypothesis with which to consider the purpose of memory, and can help explain a variety of phenomena, ranging from recognition to first impressions, and from the brain's 'default mode' to a host of mental disorders. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Anticipation; Default network; Expectation; Foresight; Memory; Mindset","brain; cognition; hominid; memory; neurology",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologica, 45, pp. 1363-1377. , doi:10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.10.016; Allen, S.W., Brooks, L.R., Specializing the operation of an explicit rule (1991) J.

Episodic memory shares a core neural network with the simulation of future episodes, enabling mental time travel into both the past and the future. The notion that there might be something distinctly human about mental time travel has provoked ingenious attempts to demonstrate episodic memory or future simulation in non-human animals, but we argue that they have not yet established a capacity comparable to the human faculty. The evolution of the capacity to simulate possible future events, based on episodic memory, enhanced fitness by enabling action in preparation of different possible scenarios that increased present or future survival and reproduction chances. Human language may have evolved in the first instance for the sharing of past and planned future events, and, indeed, fictional ones, further enhancing fitness in social settings. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Amnesia; Episodic memory; Evolution; Foresight; Language; Mental time travel","brain; evolutionary biology; fitness; hominid; language; memory; nervous system disorder; survival; travel time; Animalia",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Schacter, D.L., Effects of detail and temporal distance of past and future events on the engagement of a common neural network (2008) Hippocampus, 18, pp. 227-237. , doi:10.1002/hipo.20405; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377. , doi:10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.10.016; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Age-related changes in the episodic simulation of future events (2008) Psychol.

Burns School of Medicine, Honolulu, United States","Alarming trends in the resurgence of vector-borne diseases are anticipated to continue unless more effective action is taken to address the variety of underlying causes. Social factors, anthropogenic environmental modifications and/or ecological, changes appear to be the primary drivers. The ecological dimension of vector-borne disease research and management is a pervasive element because this issue is essentially an ecological problem with biophysical, social, and economic dimensions. However there is often a lack of clarity about the ecological dimension, the field of ecology (e.g. role, limitations), and related concepts pertinent to ecosystem, approaches to health. An ecological perspective can provide foresight into the appropriateness of interventions, provide answers to unexpected vector control responses, and contribute to effective management solutions in an ever-changing environment. The aim of this paper is to explore the ecological dimension of vector-borne diseases and to provide further clarity about the role of ""ecological thinking"" in the development and implementation of vector control activities (i.e. ecosystem approaches to vector-borne diseases).","Chagas disease; Communicable diseases; Dengue; Ecological studies; Ecosystem",,,,,,"Smolinski, M.S., Hamburg, M.A., Lederberg, J., (2003) Microbial threats to health: Emergence, detection, and response, , Washington DC: National Academies Press;; Gubler, D.J., The global emergence/resurgence of arboviral diseases as public health problems (2002) Arch Med Res, 33, pp. 330-342; Gubler, D.J., The emergence of epidemic dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Americas: A case of failed public health policy (2005) Rev Panam Salud Pública, 17, pp. 221-224; Guha-Sapir, D., Schimmer, B., Dengue fever: New paradigms for a changing epidemiology (2005) Emerg Themes Epidemiol, 2, p. 1; Gubler, D.J., Resurgent vector-borne diseases as a global health problem (1998) Emerg Infect Dis, 4, pp. 442-450; Hassan, R.M., Scholes, R., Ash, N., (2005) Ecosystems and human well-being: Current state and trends: findings of the Condition and Trends Working Group of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, , Washington DC: Island Press;; (2005) Ecosystems and human well-being: Health synthesis, , World Health Organization, Geneva: World Health Organization;; Lebel, J., (2003) Health: An ecosystem approach, , Ottawa: International Development Research Centre;; Jones, K.E., Patel, N.G., Levy, M.A., Storeygard, A., Balk, D., Gittleman, J.L., Global trends in emerging infectious diseases (2008) Nature, 451, pp. 990-993; Campbell-Lendrum, D., Molyneux, D., Ecosystems and vector-borne disease control (2005) Ecosystems and human well-being: Policy responses, 2, pp. 353-372. , Epstein P, Githeko A, Rabinovich J, Weinstein P, editors, Washington DC: Island Press;; Klinger, I.J., (1930) The epidemiology and control of malaria in Palestine, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press;; Fontaine, R.E., (1987) Integrated vector control and selection measures suitable for specific epidemiological conditions, , Geneva: World Health Organization;; The feasibility of eradicating Aedes aegypti in the Americas (1997) Rev Panam Salud Pública, 1, pp. 68-72; Schliessmann, D.J., Calheiros, L.B., A review of the status of yellow fever and Aedes aegypti eradication programs in the Americas (1974) Mosq News, pp. 1-9. , 34; Laird, M., Vector ecology and integrated control procedures (1963) Bull World Health Organ, 29, pp. 147-151; Carson R.

This complexity arises from a number of developments, many of which depend upon and affect each other. As far as the technology is concerned, it becomes more powerful, cheaper, and more reliable. The simplest illustration of that is Moore’s law, the basic thrust of which is that everything — in the technological world — changes exponentially. As far as the industrial processes and services are concerned, there is an increasing horizontal and vertical integration — partly because of the possibilities that new technologies offer. This is seen not only within specific industries, but also in the way that, for example, energy distribution or finance links regions and countries. With regard to the demands from end users, be they owners or consumers, the requirements for faster, more diversified, and more reliable ser- vices seem insatiable. This means that products and services almost literally must be available anytime and anywhere. In recent years it has also become clear that all this must be achieved without undue effects on the local and global environments. These developments, and there may be others, contribute to the complexity of industrial environments. © 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Hollnagel, E., (2004) Barriers and Accident Prevention, , Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Limited; Simon, H.A., (1945) Administrative Behavior, , New York: The Free Press; Woods, D.D., Cook, R.I., Nine steps to move forward from error (2002) Cognition, Technology, and Work, 4 (2), pp. 137-144",,,,"CRC Press",,,,,,9781420092493; 9781420092486,,,"English","Safer Complex Industrial Environments: A Human Factors Approach",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056934510

A deterministic optimization model precisely represents hydropower generation by taking into consideration water head as a nonlinear function of storage, discharge and spillage. The inflow is made available by a forecasting model based on a fuzzy inference system that captures the nonlinear correlation of consecutive inflows on an annual basis, with disaggregation of the results on a monthly basis. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation for a multi-reservoir system, based on historical inflow records and compared to the same approach on monthly basis. The results show that the proposed approach leads to an operational performance closer to that of the perfect foresight solution, providing lower spillages and higher average hydropower efficiency and generation.","Fuzzy inference systems; Hydrothermal power systems; Inflow forecasting; Nonlinear optimization; Predictive control","Electric power system control; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Model predictive control; Nonlinear programming; Reservoirs (water); Scheduling; Deterministic optimization; Fuzzy inference systems; Hydrothermal power systems; Non-linear correlations; Non-linear optimization; Open loop feedback control; Operational performance; Predictive control; Power control",,,,,"Arvanitidis, N.V., Rosing, J., Composite representation of a multireservoir hydroelectric power system (1970) IEEE Trans. on Power Apparatus and Systems, PAS-89, pp. 319-326; Bellman, R.E., (1957) Dynamic Programming, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Chiu, S., A cluster estimation method with extension to fuzzy model identification (1994) Proceedings of the Third IEEE Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 2, pp. 1240-1245; Cruz Jr., G., Soares, S., Non-uniforme composite representation of hydroelectric systems for long-term hydrothermal scheduling (1996) IEEE Trans. on Power Systems, 11 (2), pp. 701-707; Dembo, R.S., Scenario optimization (1991) Annals of Operations Research, 30 (1), pp. 63-80; Escudero, L.F., De La Fuente, J.L., Garcia, C., Pietro, F.J., Hydropower generation management under uncertainty via scenario analysis and parallel computation (1996) IEEE Trans. on Power Systems, 11 (2), pp. 683-689; Jacobs, R., Jordan, M., Nowlan, S., Hinton, G., Adaptive mixture of local experts (1991) Neural Computation, 3 (1), pp. 79-87; Labadie, J.W., Optimal operation of multireservoir systems: State-of-the-art review (2004) Jour. of Water Resources Planning and Management, 130 (2), pp. 93-111; Lapide, L., Top-down & bottom-up forecasting in S&OP (2006) Jour. of Business Forecasting, 25 (2), pp. 14-16; Luna, I., Soares, S., Ballini, R., A constructive vs. An online approach for time series prediction (2007) IEEE Procs. of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Meeting-NAFIPS'07, pp. 256-261; Martinez, L., Soares, S., Comparison between closed-loop and partial open-loop feedback control policies in long-term hydro-thermal scheduling (2002) IEEE Trans. on Power Syst., 17 (2); Mitra, S., Hayashi, Y., Neuro-fuzzy rule generation: Survey in soft computing framework (2000) IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks, 11 (3), pp. 748-768; Nabona, N., Multicommodity network flow model for long-term hydrogeneration optimization (1993) IEEE Trans. on Power Syst., 8 (2), pp. 395-404; Oliveira, G.G., Soares, S., A second-order network flow algorithm for hydro-thermal scheduling (1995) IEEE Trans. on Power Syst., 10 (3), pp. 1652-1641; Pereira, M.V.F., Pinto, L.M.V.G., Multi-stage stochastic optimization applied to energy planning (1991) Math.

Building on the success of HERMES, the European Commission has funded a new project that will begin as HERMES ends. This project, entitled HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man's Impact on European Seas), will have a greater focus on human impacts in the deep-sea environment and will place more emphasis on the translation of information into policy. It will have a wider public outreach program and will include new areas of research, such as seamounts and hydrothermal vents. The HERMIONE project will address issues raised in the EC foresight document, The Deep-Sea Frontier: Science Challenges for a Sustainable Future (Cochonat et al., 2007), and will focus on four key objectives. These follow a logical progression, from investigating the physical dimensions of ecosystems, to understanding how they function and interconnect, to studying how they are impacted by human activity, to ensuring that this project can contribute to their sustainable management and protection.

The proof architecture links a layer of behavioral reasoning over system-trace sets with a concrete, fairly realistic implementation written in C. Our microkernel provides an infrastructure for memory virtualization, for communication with hardware devices, for processes (represented as a sequence of assembly instructions, which are executed concurrently over an underlying, formally defined processor), and for inter-process communication (IPC) via synchronous message passing. The kernel establishes process switches according to IPCs and timer-events; the scheduling of process switches, however, follows a hierarchy of priorities, favoring, e.g., system processes over application processes over maintenance processes. Besides the quite substantial models developed in Isabelle/HOL and the formal clarification of their relationship, we provide a detailed analysis what formal requirements a microkernel imposes on the key ingredients (hardware, timers, machine-dependent code) in order to establish the correct operation of the overall system. On the methodological side, we show how early modeling with foresight to the later verification has substantially helped our project. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Formal verification; Interactive theorem proving; Isabelle/HOL; Microkernel","Formal verification; Hardware; Message passing; Application process; Assembly instructions; Behavioral reasoning; Interactive theorem proving; Interprocess communication; Isabelle/HOl; Memory virtualization; Microkernel; Scheduling",,,,,"Alkassar, E., Hillebrand, M.A., Woodcock, J., Shankar, N., Formal functional verification of device drivers (2008) LNCS, 5295, pp. 225-239. , Verified Software: Theories, Tools, and Experiments, Springer New York; Alkassar, E., Hillebrand, M.A., Leinenbach, D., Schirmer, N.W., Starostin, A., Shankar, N., Woodcock, J., The Verisoft approach to systems verification (2008) LNCS, 5295, pp. 209-224. , Verified Software: Theories, Tools, and Experiments, Springer New York; Alkassar, E., Leinenbach, D.C., Schirmer, N.W., Starostin, A., Tsyban, A., Balancing the load-leveraging a semantics stack for systems verification (2009) J.

What does it consist in, how has it developed and how is it currently evolving? In this article, Martine Padilla demonstrates the main characteristics of this diet and shows how eating patterns are developing in the various regions of the Mediterranean Basin, chiefly as a result of societal changes and modernization. She also analyses the impacts of these changes with regard to food security, both quantitative and qualitative. Then, basing herself on a foresight exercise on quantitative and qualitative food security in the Mediterranean region to the year 2020, she presents four possible future scenarios. These are: ""Food Autism"", ""The Market and Modernity at All Costs"", ""A Harmonious Combination of the Local and the International,"" and ""Taking Responsibility for Food: Redistribution and Health"". Lastly, she offers a series of recommendations designed to promote the desired food security, including, most notably, a concerted, all-embracing, consumer-centred policy, respect for traditional produce, and the mobilization of actors at all levels of the supply chain. These are lines of action that can all contribute to the - environmental and cultural - sustainability of the Mediterranean region.",,,,,,,"Ancel, K.E.Y.S., Coronary Heart Disease in Seven Countries (1970) Circulation, 41 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 1-191. , «; Ancel, K.E.Y.S., (1980) Seven Countries: A Multivariate Analysis of Death and Coronary Heart Disease, , Cambridge Mass, Harvard University Press; LORGERIL Michel (de), RENAUD Serge, MAMELLE Nicole et alii. « Mediterranean Alpha-linolenic Acid Rich Diet in Secondary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease ».

Underpinned theoretically by Norbert Elias's seminal empirical work the civilising Process, this article seeks to identify the societal preconditions for the emergence of Real Tennis, and provide explanations for its diffusion across Western Europe and subsequent boom in popularity among the nobility. A critique is offered of the current body of literature written on Real Tennis, with an aim to address a general lack of focus on the game's ‘social’ elements and how their development is linked with structural changes to the game over the centuries. The article then goes on to examine the ways in which Real Tennis became a symbol of prestige and a tool for social mobility among the increasingly status-competitive royal court nobility. Played during royal festivals, the game provided opportunities for nobles to engage in conspicuous consumption through architectural, clothing and gambling displays; having an entourage in accompaniment to the noble players; and, through the style of play and behavioural control, exhibiting self-restraint and foresight. Overall, an attempt is made to apply Elias's theoretical framework to aid our understanding of the development of Real Tennis, a game that has never been characterised by overt ‘violence’ of the kind examined previously by other sociologists employing an Eliasian framework. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This work is part of a wider study exploring the perceptions of both nurses and midwives about safety culture. Data were collected through the use of focus groups and were analyzed using a thematic approach. The study was set in a large obstetric hospital with a diverse client population within an urban acute NHS trust in England. A voluntary sample of 5 senior midwifery managers, 6 community midwives, 17 midwifery students and 5 midwifery support staff participated in the study. Seven main themes were identified from the data: error reporting and under-reporting; client expectations of the service; feedback and learning; decision-making and staffing; communication; prioritization of safety; and staff safety. Key considerations and implications for practice were that: organizations must ensure that all staff are given the authority to complete incident reports; systematic feedback geared towards effective learning is cascaded to all levels of staff; targeted education and training on effective communication strategies and core skills for safety are offered to midwifery managers; foresight training is provided to all front-line clinical staff to make them more 'risk aware' and 'error wise'; and patient safety is accorded the highest priority at trust board level.",,,,,,,"Annells, M., Hermeneutic phenomenology: Philosophical perspectives and current use in nursing research (1996) J Adv Nurs, 23 (4), pp. 705-713; Barbour, R., Kitzinger, J., (1999) Developing Focus Group Research: Politics, Theory and Practice, , Sage, London; Case, P., Tracing the organizational culture debate (1994) Anthropology in Action, 1 (2), pp. 9-11; Cheyne, A., Thomas, J.M., Cox, S., Oliver, A., Modelling employee attitudes to safety: A comparison across sectors (1999) Journal of the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, 4 (2), pp. 37-51; Cox, S., Cheyne, A.J.T., Assessing safety culture in offshore environments (2000) Saf Sci, 34 (1-3), pp. 111-129; Currie, V.L., Watterson, L., Challenges in the delivery of safety care: A report on a quality improvement initiative (2006) J Nurs Manag, 15 (2), pp. 162-168; Davies, H., Nutley, S., Mannion, R., Organisational culture and quality of health care (2000) Qual Health Care, 9 (2), pp. 111-119; (2000) An Organisation with a Memory, , Department of Health Expert Group, Stationery Office, London; (2007) Maternity Matters: Choice, Access and Continuity of Care in a Safe Service, , Department of Health, Stationery Office, London; Fern, E.F., (2001) Advanced Focus Group Research, , Sage, London; Gadd, S., Collins, A.M., (2002) Safety Culture: A Review of the Literature, , Health and Safety Laboratory, Sheffield; Green, J., Hart, L., The impact of context on data (1999) Developing Focus Group Research, , Barbour R, Kitzinger J. eds, Sage, London; (2003) Maternity Services: Ashford and St Peter's NHS Trust, , Healthcare Commission, London; (2004) A Summary of the Investigation into Maternity Services Provided by the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust at New Cross Hospital, , www.cqc.org.uk/_db/_documents/04011739.pdf, Healthcare Commission, Healthcare Commission, London, (accessed 14 September 2009); (2005) Review of Maternity services Provided by North West London Hospitals NHS Trust: Department of Health Action Plan, , www.cqc.org.uk/_db/_documents/04018531.pdf, Healthcare Commission, Healthcare Commission, London, (accessed 14 September 2009); (2006) Investigation Into 10 Maternal Deaths at, or Following Delivery at, Northick Park Hospital, North West London Hospitals NHS Trust, Between April 2002 and April 2005, , Healthcare Commission, August 2006.Healthcare Commission, London; (2006) Investigation into Outbreaks of Clostridium Difficile at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust, , Healthcare Commission, Healthcare Commission, London; (2007) Investigation into Clostridium Difficile at Kent and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, , http://tinyurl.com/pocfdu, Healthcare Commission, Healthcare Commission, London, (accessed 14 September 2009); (2009) Investigations into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, , Healthcare Commission, Healthcare Commission, London; Patient safety (2009) Sixth Report of Session 2008-09, pp. HC151-HC151. , House of Commons Health committee, The Stationery Office, London; Kirkham, M., The culture of midwifery in the national health service in England (1999) J Adv Nurs, 30 (3), pp. 732-739; Kitzinger, J., Barbour, R.S., Introduction: The challenge and promise of focus groups (1999) Developing Focus Group Research, , Barbour J, Kitzinger. eds, Sage, London; Lee, T., Harrison, K., Assessing safety culture in nuclear power stations (2000) Saf Sci, 30, pp. 61-97; McLafferty, I., Focus group interviews as a data collecting strategy (2004) J Adv Nurs, 48 (2), pp. 187-194; Mearns, K., Flin, R., O'Connor, P., Sharing 'worlds at risk': Improving communication with crew resource management (2001) J Risk Res, 4 (4), pp. 377-392; A safer place for patients: Learning to improve patient safety (2005) Report By the Comptroller and Auditor General, , http://tinyurl.com/nv5m33, National Audit Office, Stationery Office, London, (accessed 14 September 2009); NHS litigation aurthority (2009) Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts: Maternity Clinical Risk Management Standards, , www.nhsla.com/NR/rdonlyres/42975A74-1BE2-458D-AAAA-56E027871E3F/0/ CNSTMaternityStandards.doc, Verson 2 2009/10.

As a part of a national agenda for development of ""Comprehensive Scientific Map of the Country"", the draft of the plan in the health-sector has been prepared. Methods: A combination of two normative and exploratory approaches has been adopted to prepare the plan. For each part of the plan, a project defined. The group-projects developed their parts and consequently the draft of the plan developed. In the normative approach, the Islamic-Iranian values besides the country's vision for the year 2025 were assumed. National Innovation System concept used to analyze the related environment. Expert panels, using foresight methods, mainly prepared the information required for developing the plan. To finalize the plan, the draft was disseminated and receiving feedbacks, the document was polished appropriately. Results: The long-term plan in the health sector has been prepared with the participation of around three-hundred experts. This plan includes vision, goals, monitoring and evaluation indicators, priorities, scenarios, policies, strategies, and requisites. Conclusion: The main challenges were as follows: considering equity in health, balance in choosing priorities (primordial and primary prevention against advanced technologies), and the role of the government in knowledge management.","Iran; National Innovation Systems; Policy; Research; Science; Technology",,,,,,"Strengthening Health System (2004) World Report on Knowledge for Better Health, , World Health Organization, In:, World Health Organization, Geneva; Matlin, S.A., The scope and potential of innovation for health and health equity (2008) Global Forum Update on Research for Health.

He was an ambitious young merchant from Alleppo who came to Calcutta via Surat. Interested in establishing trading links from London to Shanghai, Shalom and the other early Jewish settlers traded in indigo, ivory, cotton, yarn, gold leaf, silk, Veniceware, precious stones, coffee, and cash crops like sesame oil, jute, sugar, spices, indigo and later, opium. Shalom was soon joined by his nephew Moses Simon Duek HaCohen, who played a key role in framing the first constitution of the community. Around this time also arrived, for a brief period, Joseph Ezra whose son David Ezra, was soon to return to Calcutta and begin to create the Ezra empire. With uncanny foresight, David invested in real estate, realizing that the dingy and disreputable streets of Calcutta would soon be commanding a high price as the capital of British India. The two famed synagogues of Calcutta are the Beth El and the Maghen David. Though the first generations of Calcutta Jews spoke Judeo - Arabic at home, by the 1890s English was widely spoken. They also moved to a select residential area south of Park Street and began to take a prominent role in Calcutta's public life. The Jewish community of Kolkata was part of the colonial elite and two Jewish clubs were established in the city, the Judean and Maccabi clubs, which became the haunts for social intermingling of the richer Jews families. © 2009 Himadri Banerjee, Nilanjana Gupta and Sipra Mukherjee editorial matter and selection.",,,,,,,"Silliman, J., (2001) Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames: Women's Narratives from a Diaspora of Hope, , Seagull Books, Calcutta; (2007), http://www.asiasource.org/arts/silliman.cfm, Interview of Jael Siliman to AsiaSource, 8 March; Sadka, S., (1992), Suit No: 162 of 1988, and Others Versus Aaron Harazi and Others, in the Calcutta High Court, Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction, by the Honourable Mr Justice Ajoy Nath Ray, 22 December, High Court","Mukherjee, S.; West Bengal State UniversityIndia",,,"Anthem Press",,,,,,9781843318057; 9788190583558,,,"English","Calcutta Mosaic: Essays and Interviews on the Minority Communities of Calcutta",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940025099

How long a peace lasts is to some degree a function of the skills and foresight of its constructors, but sooner or later the currents of history, which one cannot reasonably have expected its architects to foresee, undermine every such construction. The shape of the Middle East that emerged as a consequence of the world war, and its degree of stability, was a function of the interactions among three dimensions of peace making. The first, which was difficult to master, was circumstance. The turmoil which the war caused in the international power system made the shaping of medium-and long-term policy extremely difficult while imparting a commanding urgency to the short term. The second dimension, which statesmen might have managed better, was process. Making policy was the business of a machine with multiple moving parts - a Rubik 's cube of competing agencies and forceful individuals, whose activities never combined to show a uniform face. The third dimension, least understood by contemporaries, was local context. Peace making between warring states had once been a matter of drawing new maps of power. The maintenance of peace in a region, where religious beliefs were complex, social structures primitive by European standards, and polities in the sense familiar to the peacemakers effectively nonexistent, required a level of cultural understanding that far surpassed what European statesmen, diplomats, and soldiers had hitherto needed. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,,,,,,"Kedourie, E., (1987) England and the Middle East: The Destruction of the Ottoman Empire 1914-1921, p. 8. , (Boulder, CO); Eckstein-Frankl, M.G., (1969) The Development of British War Aims August 1914-March 1915, pp. 227-228. , University of London Dissertation, Z53; Rothwell, V.H., (1971) British War Aims and Peace Diplomacy 1914-1918, p. 127. , (Oxford); Fromkin, D., (1989) A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East, 1914-1922, pp. 96-97. , (London), 143; Fisher, J., (1999) Curzon and British Imperialism in the Middle East 1916-19, p. 212. , (London); Millman, B., (2001) A Counsel of Despair: British Strategy and War Aims, 1917-18, 36 (2), p. 260. , Journal of Contemporary History April; Kedourie, E., (1976) In the Anglo-Arab Labyrinth: The McMakon-Husayn Correspondence and Its Interpretations 1914-1939, pp. 17-22. , (Cambridge); Busch, B.C., (1976) Mudros to Lausanne: Britain's Frontier in West Asia, 1918-1923, pp. 215-222. , (Albany, NY), 247-51; Paris, T.J., (1998) British Middle East Policy-Making after the First World War: The Lawrentian and Wilsonian Schools, 41, p. 776. , Historical Journal, no. 3, September; Toynbee, A., (1970) The McMahon-Hussain Correspondence: Comment and Reply, 5 (4), p. 188. , “Isaiah Freedman”, Journal of Contemporary History; Fisher, J., (2002) The Rabegh Crisis, 1916-17: A Comparatively Trivial Question or A Self-Willed Disaster, 38, p. 76. , Middle Eastern Studies, no. 3; Friedman, I., (1970) The McMahon-Hussein Correspondence and the Question of Palestine, 5, p. 85. , Journal of Contemporary History; Peter Fitzgerald, E., (1994) France's Middle Eastern Ambitions, the Sykes-Picot Negotiations, and the Oil Fields of Mosul, 1915-1918, 66, pp. 707-715. , Journal of Modern History December; Adelson, R., (1995) London and the Invention of the Middle East: Money, Power, and War, 1902-1922, p. 134. , (New Haven, CT), 136; Levene, M., (1992) The Balfour Declaration: A Case of Mistaken Identity, 107, pp. 60-63. , English Historical Review, no. 422, January; French, D., (1995) The Strategy of the Lloyd George Coalition, 1916-1918, p. 2063. , (Oxford); Monroe, E., (1963) Britain's Moment in the Middle East, 1914-1936, p. 66. , (London); Lukitz, L., (2006) A Quest in the Middle East: Gertrude Bell and the Making of Modern Iraq, pp. 121-129. , (New York); Winstone, H.V.F., (1978) Gertrude Bell, p. 235. , (London); Kostiner, J., (1995) Prologue of Hashemite Downfall and Saudi Ascendancy: A New Look at the Khurma Dispute, 1917-1919, p. 57. , The Hashemites in the Modern World: Essays in Honour of the Late Professor Uriel Danned, ed. by Asher Susser and Aryeh Shmuelevitz (London)",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781139174534; 9780521517195,,,"English","The Mak. of Peace: Rulers, States, and the Aftermath of War",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925667158

The demonstrated persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxic potential of these compounds in animals and in humans are of increasing concern. The oceans are considered global sinks for PBDEs, as higher levels are found in marine organisms than in terrestrial biota. For the past three decades, North America has dominated the world market demand for PBDEs, consuming 95% of the penta-BDE formulation. Accordingly, the PBDE concentrations in marine biota and people from North America are the highest in the world and are increasing. Despite recent restrictions on penta- and octa-BDE commercial formulations, penta-BDE containing products will remain a reservoir for PBDE release for years to come, and the deca-BDE formulation is still in high-volume use. In this paper, we review all available data on the occurrence and trends of PBDEs in the marine ecosystems (air, water, sediments, invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and marine mammals) of North and South America. We outline here our concerns about the potential future impacts of large existing stores of banned PBDEs in consumer products, and the vast and growing reservoirs of deca-BDE as well as new and naturally occurring brominated compounds on marine ecosystems. © 2009 Freund Publishing House Limited.","Biomagnification; Brominated flame retardants; Marine food webs; Natural organobromine compounds; Novel BFRs; PBDEs","domestic chemical; ether derivative; organic compound; polybrominated biphenyl; water; bioaccumulation; environmental exposure; fish; food web; human; invertebrate; marine environment; marine mammal; marine species; nonhuman; reservoir; review; seabird; sediment; South America; textile; Animalia; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Animals; Ecosystem; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Marine Biology; North America; Seawater; South America; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,"Alaee, M., Arias, P., Sjodin, A., Bergman, A., An overview of commercially used brominated flame retardants, their applications, their use patterns in different countries/regions and possible modes of release (2003) Environment International, 29 (6), pp. 683-689. , DOI 10.1016/S0160-4120(03)00121-1; Darnerud, P.O., Toxic effects of brominated flame retardants in man and in wildlife (2003) Environ Int, 29, pp. 841-843; Hites, R.A., Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers in the Environment and in People: A Meta-Analysis of Concentrations (2004) Environmental Science and Technology, 38 (4), pp. 945-956; De Wit, C.A., An overview of brominated flame retardants in the environment (2002) Chemosphere, 46, pp. 583-624; Law, R.J., Allchin, C.R., De Boer, J., Covaci, A., Herzke, D., Lepom, P., Morris, S., De Wit, C.A., Levels and trends of brominated flame retardants in the European environment (2006) Chemosphere, 64 (2), pp. 187-208. , DOI 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.12.007, PII S0045653505014347; Tanabe, S., Ramu, K., Isobe, T., Takahashi, S., Brominated flame retardants in the environment of Asia-Pacific: An overview of spatial and temporal trends (2008) Journal of Environmental Monitoring, 10 (2), pp. 188-197. , DOI 10.1039/b709928b; De Boer, J., Wester, P.G., Klamer, H.J.C., Lewis, W.E., Boon, J.P., Do flame retardants threaten ocean life?

The units of analysis to be used are the educational laws and bills designed by the current national government. A comparative and historical analysis is made of the approved '90s legislation, which led to a structural reform of the educational system. A description is given of the changes then applied to both its academic structure and the institutional organization of the system. In principle, the current reform consists of two national laws, authorised in 2005, which regulate partially educational issues and a new national law for education, which was introduced and passed by the Parliament at the end of 2006. The legislation from the '90s is countermanded by this new 2006 education law, which establishes a new academic structure. The implementation of such a structure could be challenging given that, in that respect, the starting point is also difficult due to the inequality and discrimination in the national education system. It is necessary to learn from the 1993 Federal Law on Education. If we do not take notice of the conditions in which Argentinean education occurs, as a consequence of the implementation of the afore-mentioned law, the achievement of the objectives set by this bill is highly unlikely. We can see the emergence once again of the absolute lack of foresight of the potential consequences of further alterations in the academic educational structure, in the scope of government authorities holding concurrent competences whilst trying to implement the new structure differently. It constitutes a serious problem, the consequences of which seem not to be sufficiently considered.","Academic structure; Educational laws; Educational policy; Educational reform; Educational system",,,,,,,"Ruiz, G.; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Universidad de Buenos AiresArgentina; email: gruiz@psi.uba.ar",,,,,,,,00348082,,,,"Spanish","Revista Educ.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349497317

It aims at assessing key drivers and key bottlenecks for their deployment, focusing particularly on the role of biofuels and hydrogen in meeting climate policy objectives. The analysis is pursued using the Global Multi-regional MARKAL model (GMM), a perfect foresight ""bottom-up"" model of the global energy system with a detailed representation of alternative fuel chains, linked to the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC). The analysis shows that biofuels are limited by the regional availability of low-cost biomass, but can be important for meeting mild climate policy targets. If policy-makers intend to pursue more stringent climate policy, then hydrogen becomes a competitive option. However, the analysis finds that the use of hydrogen in personal transport is restricted to very stringent climate policy, as only such policy provides enough incentive to build up the required delivery infrastructure. An analysis of costs additionally shows that ""keeping the hydrogen option open"" does not take considerable investments compared to the investment needs in the power sector within the next decades, but allows the use of hydrogen for the pursuit of stringent climate policy in the second half of the century. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

John Hammond, the producer at Columbia, first became interested in Dylan after seeing him play harmonica during a few sessions for Carolyn Hester's third album. At the time, Hammond was looking for someone who would allow Columbia to tap into the emerging folk-music craze; Dylan easily fit the profile. He walked, talked, dressed, and sang like a folkie. If it was all an act, something he learned by studying Woody Guthrie and Ramblin' Jack Elliott, his performance was authentic enough to convince everyone that he had some real talent. No one could have predicted just how long the act would last. Bob Dylan is an album very much about the process by which Dylan found his voice. Of its thirteen tracks, only two are originals (“Song to Woody” and “Talkin' New York”). He was less interested in showcasing his originality than in paying tribute to a long list of influences that included Blind Lemon Jefferson, Woody Guthrie, Jesse Fuller, Hank Williams, and Reverend Gary Davis. The album cover is of the “meet the band” variety; a young, wistful boy dressed in a sheepskin jacket and cap has his hands clasped around the neck of an acoustic guitar. The expression seems earnest enough, but there is a devilish bend in the eyebrows that makes you think he's either full of himself or having fun with the idea. Dylan's first album didn't generate the sales that Columbia had hoped for, and there was some talk that they might drop him. Hammond, who agreed to record one LP with Dylan with the option to contract four more, decided to give his latest discovery another chance. It was a good thing he had the foresight to recognize that Dylan was just getting started. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,,,,,,,"Eric, B.; Department of Comparative Literature, Yale UniversityUnited States",,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781139002417; 9780521886949,,,"English","The Camb.

He started his career achieving his BS and DVM degrees from Iowa State University (ISU). He returned to ISU after a brief period in private practice in Illinois. His well-recognized career in veterinary pathology began with his MS and PhD degrees, followed by a five-year period of teaching at ISU. Dr. Prasse joined the faculty of the University of Georgia in 1972, and thus began a long-term partnership with Dr. Bob Duncan that is arguably the foundation of veterinary clinical pathology. The textbook they authored, Veterinary Laboratory Medicine: Clinical Pathology, or ""Duncan and Prasse"" as it is known, remains the standard today, with later participation from Dr. Ed Mahaffey and most recently Dr. Ken Latimer. Dr. Prasse has mentored numerous graduate students and received many awards over his 23-year career in teaching, including the Norden Distinguished Teaching award twice, once at ISU and once at Georgia. His leadership as President or the American College of Veterinary Pathologists was greatly acknowledged and appreciated. Dr. Prasse's administrative service at the University of Georgia spanned 14 years, first as Associate Dean for Public Service and Outreach and later as Dean for eight years, during which time he served as President of the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC). The growth of the College of Veterinary Medicine under Dean Prasse's visionary leadership was extraordinary. He led through difficult economic and political times, yet the college and its community continued to prosper. His legacy at the University of Georgia is indelible and perpetual. His outstanding leadership of the college was recognized by the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association in 2004, when be was given the Georgia Veterinarian of the Year award. Since his retirement from Georgia, Dr. Prasse has contributed greatly to the profession and to the AAVMC by leading the Foresight project. Dr. Prasse honored those attending the 2009 AAVMC Symposium by giving the Recognition Lecture. As always, his address was inspirational, and the substance of it is included here. © 2009 AAVMC.",,"animal; article; awards and prizes; Canada; cat; clinical competence; curriculum; dog; education; health care organization; horse; human; leadership; legal aspect; licensing; school; standard; United States; veterinary medicine",,,,,,"Prasse, K.W.; The University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, Athens, GA, United States; email: kprasse@uga.edu",,,,,,,,0748321X,,,,"English","J.

There has been extensive research into the flow physics associated with FC. This paper focuses on developing an understanding of the costs and design drivers associated with the systems needed and certification. The research method adopted is based on three research strands: 1. Study of the historical development of other disruptive technologies for civil transport aircraft, 2. Analysis of the impact of legal and commercial requirements, and 3. Technological foresight based on technology trends for aircraft currently under development. Fly by wire and composite materials are identified as two historical examples of successful implementation of disruptive new technology. Both took decades to develop, and were initially developed for military markets. The most widely studied technology similar to FC is identified as laminar flow control. Despite more than six decades of research and arguably successful operational demonstration in the 1990s this has not been successfully transitioned to commercial products. Significant future challenges are identified in cost effective provision of the additional systems required for environmental protection and in service monitoring of FC systems particularly where multiple distributed actuators are envisaged. FC generated noise is also seen as a significant challenge. Additional complexity introduced by FC systems must also be balanced by the commercial imperative of dispatch reliability, which may impose more stringent constraints than legal (certification) requirements. It is proposed that a key driver for future successful application of FC is the likely availability of significant electrical power generation on 787 aircraft forwards. This increases the competitiveness of electri cally driven FC systems compared with those using engine bleed air. At the current rate of progress it is unlikely FC will make a contribution to the next generation of single-aisle aircraft due to enter service in 2015. In the longer term, there needs to be significant movement across a broad range of systems technologies before the aerodynamic benefits of FC can be exploited.",,"Aerodynamics; Cost effectiveness; Fighter aircraft; Flight control systems; Flow control; Laminar flow; Transport aircraft; Aero-dynamic performance; Commercial requirements; Disruptive technology; Distributed actuators; Electrical power generation; Historical development; Single aisle aircrafts; Stringent constraints; Aircraft control",,,,,"Bushnell, D., Application frontiers of 'designer fluid mechanics'-Visions versus reality or an attempt to answer the perennial question 'why isn't it used'?

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prospective study included 80 patients with 115 forearm fractures, assigned to two equal groups, based on the fixation method. The group included 53 males and 27 females, the mean age was 36.6 years of age (range 18-77). the mean folow up period was 18 months (range 12-32 months). The patients were repetitevely x-rayed and their functional assessment was performed at the same time. Furthermore, treatment- related complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: Two cases of prolonged healing were recorded in the LCP device treatment group. Four cases of prolonged healing were recorded in the intramedullary nailing group, which healed within 18 months and did not require reoperation. The mean fracture healing time was 20.5 weeks (range 9-80 weeks) in the group with intramedullary nailing, and 19.0 weeks (range 12-46 weeks) in the LCP group. No significat differences in surgery time, healing time, postoperative pain scores or final 1-year functional outcomes were detected between the both treatment groups. Statistically significant prolonged healing was demonstrated in the intramedullary nailing group in cases, where fragment dislocation exceeded 3 mm, compared to a group of patients with anatomical repositioning and dislocation of less than 2 mm (p = 0.015; Anova). No cases of deep infections were recorded. Complications, recorded in the intramedullary nailing group, included the following: partial migration of securing nails in two subjects and incomplete synostosis in two subjects. Complications, recorded in the LCP device group, included: early re-fracturing in the original fracture location in a single subject (3 weeks after extraction). DISCUSSION: The results correspond with outcomes of other recent studies. Although open repositioning and internal fixation is considered a standard treatment method in forearm diaphyseal fractures, recently changing opinion on the use of nails in this indication is apparent. Considering ongoing improvements of these implants, the trend of nailing should be more widely accepted. CONCLUSION: Although their concept of fracture fixation is different, the both implants appear indicated for the management of forearm diaphyseal fractures.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; diaphysis; female; human; injury; instrumentation; intramedullary nailing; male; middle aged; osteosynthesis; radiography; radius fracture; ulna fracture; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Diaphyses; Female; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Radius Fractures; Ulna Fractures; Young Adult",,,,,,"Visna, P.email: petr.visna@fnmotol.cz",,,,,,,,00359351,,,"20662434","Czech","Rozhl Chir",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955954270

These governmentowned investment vehicles have and will continue to play an important role in the going private phenomenon. SWFs have not only helped fuel that phenomenon through their participation as limited partners in private-equity funds and hedge funds, but their massive capital infusions into ailing financial institutions and private-equity firms in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis may, in a very real sense, save it It is not hyperbolic to suggest that the future of private equity-including the going private phenomenon-and the future of SWFs are inescapably intertwined Misguided regulation of the latter will, quite foreseeably, operate to the detriment of the former. And the scope of potential mischief is broad. SWFs have existed for decades, but today they face heightened scrutiny due to their recent rapid growth and a concomitant shift in their investment strategy from primarily conservative debt instruments to higher risk/reward equity investments. This shift in strategy has stoked fears in the United States and Europe that these funds-which find home primarily in the Middle East and Asia-will use their economic clout to pursue political goals. This type of rhetoric has led some to call for increased regulation of SWFs. In this Article we argue against imposing any additional burdens on investments by SWFs in the United States, at least at present. In our view, at this point a policy of watchful waiting is preferable to any immediate effort to impose special restrictions on SWFs On the one hand, the nightmare scenarios painted by SWF critics often involve activities that would be caught by existing laws, either as they relate to national security or to various forms of business regulation under the securities and antitrust laws On the other hand, we do not possess perfect foresight and cannot say that every possible permutation of SWF investment should escape a regulatory response in the future What we do know, however, says that the burden of proof lies on those who think that further prophylactic regulation is in order at this juncture To date, SWFs have acted as model investors, and the risk that they may act strategically in the future is significantly mitigated by existing safeguards. A far greater danger to America's economy and security inheres in taking unnecessary action that would encourage SWFs to redirect their investments elsewhere, or to harbor resentment toward the United States that could express itself in a wide range of hostile actions.",,,,,,,"Summers, L., (2007) Sovereign Funds Shake the Logic of Capitalism, Fin Times, 11. , July 30; Christopher Cox, The Rise of Sovereign Business, Gauer Distinguished Lecture in Law and Policy at the American Enterprise Institute Legal Center for the Public Interest (Dec 5, 2007), online at http://sec.gov/news/speech/2007/spch120507cc.htm (visited Jan 11, 2009); Garten, J., (2008) How to Live with the Reality of State Capitalism, Fm Times, 17. , Jan 15; Gilson, R.J., Milhaupt, C.J., Sovereign Wealth Funds and Corporate Governance: A Minimalist Response to the New Mercantilism, 60 (2008) Stan L Rev, 1345, p. 1346. , examining the rise of sovereign wealth funds and proposing a vote suspension for equity positions taken by these funds; See text accompanying notes 33-35; See text accompanying note 38; See Table 2; The fiscal deficit of the United States and its dependence on foreign oil have contributed significantly to the growth of SWFs.

And with this potential comes the possibility of stimulating sustainable economic growth and job creation. The success of nanotechnology however is not a foregone conclusion. Alongside the challenges of developing the underlying science are broader issues that will influence its success or failure: • How can we learn to use such a powerful technology wisely? - Who will decide how it is used, and who will pay the cost? • How can innovative science be translated into successful products? • And in an increasingly crowded and connected world, how will the supposed beneficiaries of nanotechnology be engaged in its development and use? These questions will not be answered without a clear strategy. And without vision and strong leadership, the future of safe and successful nanotechnologies will be put in jeopardy. This committee should be applauded for having the foresight to author the 21st Century nanotechnology Research and Development Act-an act that has enabled the United States to lead the world in developing research programs to unlock the potential of the nanoscale. Yet as nanotechnology has increasingly moved from the laboratory to the marketplace, the challenges have shifted from stimulating innovative research to using this research in the service of society. This is why it is so important that the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendment Act of 2008 builds on the strengths of the 2003 act, and establishes a framework that will support nanotechnologies that can deliver on their promise. In particular, it is vital that the reauthorization addresses the potential for nanotechnologies to cause harm- and how this might be avoided. Real and perceived risks that are poorly identified, assessed and managed will undermine even the most promising new technologies, and nanotechnology is no exception. In this context, the 2008 Act needs to explicitly address five areas if it is to establish a sound framework for enabling safe, sustainable and successful nanotechnologies: 1,2 1. Risk Research Strategy. A top-level strategic framework should be developed that identifies the goals of nanotechnology risk research across the federal government, and provides a roadmap for achieving these goals. The strategy should identify information needed to regulate and otherwise oversee the safe development and use of nanotechnologies; which agencies will take a lead in addressing specific research challenges; when critical information is needed; and how the research will be funded. This top-level, top-down strategy should reflect evolving oversight challenges. It should be informed by stakeholders from industry, academia and citizen communities. It should include measurable goals, and be reviewed 2. every two years. 2. Funding for environmental safety and health research. A minimum of 10% of the federal government's nanotechnology research and development budget should be dedicated to goal-oriented environment, health and safety (EHS) research. At least $50 million per year should be directed towards targeted research directly addressing clearly-defined strategic challenges. The balance of funding should support exploratory research that is conducted within the scope of a strategic research program. Funding should be assessed according to a top- level, top-down risk research strategy, and be overseen by cross-agency leadership. 3. Leadership for risk research. A cross-agency group should be established that is responsible for implementing a nanotechnology EHS research strategy, and is accountable for actions taken and progress made. A coordinator should be appointed to oversee this group, as well as given resources and authority to enable funding allocations and interagency partnerships that will support the implementation of a strategic research plan. 4. Transparency. Government-funded nanotechnology environment safety and health research investment should be fully transparent, providing stakeholders with information on project activities, relevance, funding and outcomes. 5. Public-Private Partnerships. Partnerships that leverage public and private funds to address critical nanotechnology oversight issues in an independent, transparent and timely manner should be established, where such partnerships have the capacity to overcome the limitations of separate government and industry initiatives. Nanotechnology is a truly revolutionary and transformative technology, and we cannot rely on past ways of doing things to succeed in the future. Without strong leadership from the top, we run the risk of compromising the whole enterprise-not only losing America's technological lead, but also jeopardizing the good that could come out of nanotechnology for other countries and the world. Already, the hubris surrounding nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;D) funding is giving way to a sobering reality: Based on the federal National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI)-identified risk-relevant projects, in 2006, the federal government spent an estimated $13 million on highly relevant nanotechnology risk research (approximately 1% of the nano R&amp;D budget), compared to $24 million in Europe,1 despite assurances from the NNI that five times this amount was spent on risk related research in Fiscal Year 2006.2 Nanotechnology will not succeed through wishful thinking alone. Instead, it will depend on clear and authoritative leadership from the top. If we are to fully realize the benefits of this innovative new technology, we must bridge the gap between our dreams and reality. When I look back on the origins of the NNI, I am impressed by the foresight and quality of leadership exerted by congressional visionaries from both sides of the aisle, the president and executive branch, scientists and engineers, businesspeople, and educators.3 Perhaps because of the tremendous successes achieved in the laboratory since its creation, we risk losing sight of the importance of meeting the challenges involved in taking the NNI to the next level of research, education, governance and commercialization. It is my belief that with the proposed act-and with the continued vigilance of this committee-this will not happen. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Methods: This study is composed of lateral and longitudinal studies to comprehend gender differences 1) in the rate, 2) in body and mind function, and 3) with time-course changes, of the elderly in need of Long-Term Care (LTC) based on the population of the categorized age groups. Results: The population ratio of the elderly in need of LTC based on gender showed as follows: 5% both males and females between 65-74 years of age, 16% males and 22% females between 75-84 years of age and 45% males and 60% females aged 85 years and over. Additionally, the population ratio of females aged 75 years and over who require LTC was significantly higher. According to 7,118 elderly dependents in need of care in categorized age groups concerning the 33 items of the following categories, ""Movement and balance"", ""Complex movement"", ""Conditions requiring special assistance"", ""Conditions requiring assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADL) / Instrumental ADL (IADL)"" and ""Communication and cognition"", males between 65-74 years of age rated higher. Significant differences in all 33 items except for ""Sitting up in bed"", ""Maintaining a sitting position"", ""Remembering date of birth"", ""Remembering own name"" and ""Stating the current location"" in males were found. On the other hand, in the case of those aged 85 and over, the female dependent rate showed higher in all 33 items except for ""Putting on and taking off a jacket"" and ""Using the telephone"", which indicated the same rate as for males. In all 33 items except for ""Sitting up in bed"", ""Swallowing"", ""Drinking water"", ""Putting on and taking off a jacket/pants"", ""Taking medication"", ""Using the telephone"" and ""Responding to instructions"", significant differences in females were found. The rate of female dependents aged 85 and over comes in order as follows: ""Standing up from a sitting position"" is 90%, which is the highest; ""Standing on one foot"" (90%); ""Sitting up in bed"", ""Walking"", ""Using the telephone"" (78%); ""Nail cutting"" (76%); ""Washing the body"" (75%); ""Financial management"" (74%); ""Taking medication"" and ""Decision making"" (72%). Basic ADL except the mentioned items above were: ""Urination"" (59%), ""Putting on and taking off a jacket/pants"" (55-56%), ""Transferring to another location"" (49%) and ""Feeding"" (34%). The two year longitudinal study showed little gender difference. However, the following decline in function in males was observed: ""Maintaining a sitting position"", ""Transferring to another location"", ""Urination"", ""Defecation"" and ""Stating the current location"" aged 65-74; ""Oral hygiene"" aged 75-84; ""Walking"" aged 85 and over. Conclusions: No gender differences in the percentage of the elderly in need of LTC aged 65-74 was indicated, whereas body and mind function of the male elderly in need of LTC decreased significantly in many items. In addition, some items displayed an easy decline in time-course changes. With respect to those aged 85 and over, the rate of body and mind function of the elderly in need of LTC decreases significantly. No gender differences in time-course changes, except for ""Walking"", were confirmed. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Dependency; Frail elderly; Functioning; Gender difference; Long-term care insurance",,,,,,"Section2.Healthy life and affluent society for older people (2005) Annual report on health, labour and welfare 2003-2004, pp. 174-178. , Gyosei; Population projections for Japan (2007) Child welfare information from Japan, pp. 64-74. , http://www.kodomomiraizaidan.or.jp/english/childwelfare_no10.pdf; (2001) International classification of functioning, disability and health, Switzerland; Kawagoe, M., Report on effectiveness of long term care insurance services (2003) Japan Medical Association Research Institute Report, p. 55. , in Japanese; Imahashi, K., Kawagoe, M., Eto, F., Haga, N., Clinical status and dependency of the elderly requiring long-term care in Japan (2007) Tohoku J.
