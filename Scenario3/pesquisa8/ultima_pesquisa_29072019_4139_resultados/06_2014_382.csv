It involves considering how the institution might look in the future. In doing so, it enables the institution to prepare for and achieve the preferred future. This article explores what the process of strategic foresight has to offer common law criminal justice systems, with a particular emphasis on the role of expert evidence in criminal jury trials. A hypothetical vision for the future set in 2030, which foresees the adoption of technological advances in the courtroom, is compared and contrasted with processes from a 2012 murder trial. We examine how a well-designed digital courtroom could enhance the delivery of expert evidence. Considering 'alternative future law scenarios' can illuminate what a legal system is likely to need in times to come and can identify the necessary steps for beneficial adaptation via research, policies, and training. © 2014 The Author.",,,,,,,"Edmond, G., 'What Lawyers Should Know About the Forensic Sciences' (2014) Adelaide Law Rev. 1, 36, pp. 2-3; Muller, S., (2011) Law Scenarios to 2030: Signposting the Legal Space of the Future, p. 8. , www.hiil.org/data/sitemanagement/media/HIIL_n18533_v1_Law_Scenarios_to_2030_v1.pdf; Marsh, N., (2002) Strategic Foresight: The Power of Standing in The Future, pp. 7-10; Global, S., (2008) Shell Energy Scenarios to 2050, pp. 16-21. , http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios/2050.html, Marsh, id; Muller, S., (2011) The Law of the Future and the Future of Law, , http://www.fichl.org/fileadmin/fichl/documents/FICHL_11_Web.pdf; Hines, A., Bishop, P., (2006) Thinking about the Future: Guidelines for Strategic Foresight, pp. 4-8; Etter, B., 'The Contribution of Forensic Science to Miscarriages of Justice' (2013) Aus.

It illustrates how the industry is adopting a new competitive strategy via services that are added to the total offering, and how it is simultaneously developing a deeper understanding of the service relationship as value co-creation. The work identifies seven trends in this context and analyses their impacts and discontinuities. Three trends are linked primarily to the business environment: a dispersing customer base, changes in media use habits, and erosion of product business. Four trends describe the behaviour of companies: the shifts from products to value-adding brands, from R&D to innovation, from autonomy to partnering and sharing in an ecosystem, and the changing resource and capability needs. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, studying media as service has been rare in scholarly literature. Second, applying the service perspective to the trend analysis in the media sector is topical due to the increasing competition and unpredictability of the business environment. © 2014 The Authors.","Foresight; Magazine publishing; Service-dominant logic; Trend analysis; Value co-creation","future prospect; literature review; strategic approach; trend analysis",,,,,"Agarwal, R., Selen, W., Dynamic capability building in service value networks for achieving service innovation (2009) Decision Sciences, 40 (3), pp. 431-475; (2006) Handbook of media management and economics, , Lawrence Erlbaum, New Jersey, A.B.

This legislation promises a re-commodification of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The Bill was bitterly contested during its passage through parliament, most vigorously in 2011. Much of the opposition occurred at a time of widespread, global rebellion, most notably in the 'Arab uprisings' and through the 'occupy movement'. Despite a plethora of protests, we argue, a non-porous boundary between what we call the 'protest sector' of civil society and the wider public sphere of the lifeworld has become apparent in England. A good deal of collective action, whether campaign-focused (like opposition to the Health and Social Care Bill) or more generalized (like rejections of corporate greed), has so far proved ineffective, at least in the short-term; no crisis of legitimation is apparent. We highlight a new 'class/command dynamic', leading to oligarchic rule, in the present era of financial capitalism. We use this health care case-study to re-examine the notion of civil society and its changing properties in what Castells calls a 'networked society'. The contribution ends with a discussion of the role of the sociologist re-civil society and the advocacy of both 'action' and 'foresight sociologies'. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Action and foresight sociologies; Class/command dynamic; Health and Social Care Act; NHS; Privatization of health care; Rethinking civil society","civil society; health care; health policy; health services; legislation; privatization; twenty first century; Article; case study; civil rights; civil society; financial capitalism; Health and Social Care Act; health care; human; national health service; political system; protest; society; sociologist; United Kingdom; economics; health care delivery; health care policy; legislation and jurisprudence; management; national health service; organization and management; theoretical model; England; United Kingdom; Wales; Delivery of Health Care; England; Health Care Reform; Models, Theoretical; Policy Making; Private Sector; Privatization; State Medicine; Wales",,,,,"Ashton, J., The art of medicine: defending democracy and the National Health Service (2012) Lancet; Bambra, C., Health inequalities and welfare state regimes: theoretical insights on a public health 'puzzle' (2011) J.Epidemiol.

Many people within Scotland had come to believe that Scotland was immune from terrorism. This perception was in large part informed by Scotland's experience during the protracted Troubles in Northern Ireland, during which the Provisional Irish Republican Army's mainland bombing campaign focused on targets in England, sparing both Scotland and Wales. While Glasgow Airport did not expect such an attack to take place, meticulous planning, organising and testing of plans had taken place to mitigate the unlikely event of such an attack. The attack stands up as a shining example of robust business continuity management, where the airport reopened for business as usual in less than 24 hours from the time of the attack. Little is known about how the airport handled the situation in conjunction with other responding agencies as people tend to want to focus on high-profile disasters only. Yet countless such incidents are happening worldwide on a daily basis, in which there are excellent learning opportunities, and, taken in the spirit of converting hindsight into foresight, the likelihood of similar incidents could potentially be reduced in the future.","airport; learning; resilience; risk; terrorism","airport; disaster planning; emergency health service; human; mass medium; organization and management; risk management; terrorism; United Kingdom; Airports; Disaster Planning; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Mass Media; Risk Management; Scotland; Terrorism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,17499216,,,"25416378","English","J Bus Contin Emer Plan",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942423786

A life is proposed as a form of ""social site"" (Marston, S.A., Jones III, J.P., & Woodward, K. (2005). Human geography without scale, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 30, 416-432.) where the future is met and negotiated. Unlike the broad sweep of historical narrative, a focus on the site of a life can reveal cumulative losses, futures denied and paths not taken. Life stories challenge historical narrative with alternative futures that 'might-have-been'; they might therefore usefully be added as a more experimental type to Inayatullah's taxonomy of historical ""traces"" (Inayatullah, S. (2012). Humanity 3000: A comparative analysis of methodological approaches to forecasting the long-term, Foresight, 14 (5), 401-417).A case study based on a life story from Aceh is used to demonstrate ways in which alternative futures can emerge from life stories and then be acted upon. The paper concludes that the experimental power of life stories as historical traces lies not only in the stories themselves but in the unique event of storytelling and its potentially transformative impact on the teller and listener, and hence the future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Experimentation; Historical traces; Life stories; Narrative; Potential futures; Transformative learning","forecasting method; future prospect; historical geography; human geography; learning; Aceh; Indonesia",,,,,"Adger, W.N., Dessai, S., Goulden, M., Hulme, M., Lorenzoni, I., Nelson, D.R., Are there social limits to adaptation to climate change?

The entry mode and the way telecoms follow to access the Base of the Pyramid market in Egypt identifies which paradigm will take place in the future. Using the case of ""My Village Phone,"" the authors develop a scenario analysis to explore the linkages between the entry modes and development paradigms. They find that ""Pro-poor,"" ""Para-poor,"" ""Per-poor,"" ""Per-poor exports,"" and ""Networked"" are expected to take place if telecoms followed the Base of the Pyramid entry mode. However, they may fail to achieve one or more of these paradigms if they followed different entry modes such as ""Capitalists mode,"" ""Skimming mode,"" ""Social responsibility mode,"" or ""Sustainability mode."" This chapter contributes toward a typology of entry modes and development scenarios for mobile telecoms market in general and for mobile microfinance specifically. At the policy level, the authors provide a testable business model for the candidate mobile telecom that looks for holding the fourth mobile license in Egypt. At the theoretical level, they offer a new conceptual framework, the balance of power (Albin, 1997; Jasperson et al., 2002), that is drawn from three social science domains: systems thinking, systemic foresight, and theories of power. © 2015, IGI Global.",,"Aluminum alloys; Commerce; Global system for mobile communications; Rural areas; Telephone sets; Base of the pyramids; Business modeling; Conceptual frameworks; Development scenarios; Scenario analysis; Social responsibilities; Systems thinking; Telecoms markets; Finance",,,,,"Albin, S., (1997) Building a system dynamics model: Conceptualization, , working paper).

Such predictions are important if the Asia-Pacific region is to reach its tourism potential. This study investigates the domestic travel motivations of 632 Australian Baby Boomer, Generation X, and Generation Y travelers to uncover each generational cohort’s travel mindset. Specifically, it considers how the sociohistorical environment when its members “came of age” during adolescence (i.e., thus creating a generation), create a unique lifelong perspective that influences both current and future tourist behavior. Although the survey results show that the travel decision-making process is similar across cohorts, model comparisons reveal generational differences. This study advances the theoretical understanding of the implications of generational perspectives on future travel behavior and provides foresight into demand factors that will drive future travel growth in the Asia-Pacific region and particularly growth in domestic leisure travel by Australians. © The Author(s) 2014.","Baby Boomer; domestic tourism; Generation X; Generation Y; travel decisions","cohort analysis; decision making; recreational activity; tourist behavior; travel behavior; Australia",,,,,"Aaker, D., Kumar, V., Day, G., (2007) Marketing Research, , 2007.

Here, using functional MRI, we demonstrate a mechanism by which the ventromedial prefrontal cortex supports such episodic simulations, and thereby contributes to affective foresight: This region supports processes that (i) integrate knowledge related to the elements that constitute an episode and (ii) represent the episode's emergent affective quality. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex achieves such integration via interactions with distributed cortical regions that process the individual elements. Its activation then signals the affective quality of the ensuing episode, which goes beyond the combined affective quality of its constituting elements. The integrative process further augments long-term retention of the episode, making it available at later time points. This mechanism thus renders the future tangible, providing a basis for farsighted behavior.","Episodic future thinking; Episodic memory; Functional MRI; Subjective value; Ventromedial prefrontal cortex","adult; affect; Article; association; behavior; episodic memory; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; knowledge; long term memory; male; normal human; simulation; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; adolescent; anticipation; biological model; cingulate gyrus; connectome; decision making; echo planar imaging; functional neuroimaging; imagination; nerve cell network; physiology; prefrontal cortex; psychological model; recognition; temporal lobe; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Anticipation, Psychological; Connectome; Decision Making; Echo-Planar Imaging; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Imagination; Knowledge; Male; Memory, Episodic; Models, Neurological; Models, Psychological; Nerve Net; Prefrontal Cortex; Recognition (Psychology); Temporal Lobe; Young Adult",,,,,"Taylor, S.E., Pham, L.B., Rivkin, I.D., Armor, D.A., Harnessing the imagination: Mental simulation, self-regulation, and coping (1998) Am Psychol, 53 (4), pp. 429-439; Sheldon, S., McAndrews, M.P., Moscovitch, M., Episodic memory processes mediated by the medial temporal lobes contribute to open-ended problem solving (2011) Neuropsychologia, 49 (9), pp. 2439-2447; Brewer, G.A., Marsh, R.L., On the role of episodic future simulation in encoding of prospective memories (2010) Cogn Neurosci, 1 (2), pp. 81-88; Schacter, D.L., Adaptive constructive processes and the future of memory (2012) Am Psychol, 67 (8), pp. 603-613; Boyer, P., Evolutionary economics of mental time travel?

Sustainable intensification (SI) is heralded as a new approach for enabling growth in agriculture while minimizing environmental impacts. However, the SI literature has overlooked a major environmental risk. Using data from eight countries on six continents, we show that few governments regulate conventionally bred pasture taxa to limit threats to natural areas, even though most agribusinesses promote taxa with substantial weed risk. New pasture taxa (including species, subspecies, varieties, cultivars, and plant-endophyte combinations) are bred with characteristics typical of invasive species and environmental weeds. By introducing novel genetic and endophyte variation, pasture taxa are imbued with additional capacity for invasion and environmental impact. New strategies to prevent future problems are urgently needed. We highlight opportunities for researchers, agribusiness, and consumers to reduce environmental risks associated with new pasture taxa. We also emphasize four main approaches that governments could consider as they build new policies to limit weed risks, including (i) national lists of taxa that are prohibited based on environmental risk; (ii) a weed risk assessment for all new taxa; (iii) a program to rapidly detect and control new taxa that invade natural areas; and (iv) the polluter-pays principle, so that if a taxon becomes an environmental weed, industry pays for its management. There is mounting pressure to increase livestock production. With foresight and planning, growth in agriculture can be achieved sustainably provided that the scope of SI expands to encompass environmental weed risks.",,"agriculture; Article; consumer; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; government; invasive species; livestock; nonhuman; pasture; planning; policy; risk assessment; scientist; weed; animal; animal food; animal husbandry; catering service; crop; domestic animal; economics; environment; environmental protection; government regulation; herbivory; introduced species; legislation and jurisprudence; organization and management; procedures; risk reduction; species difference; supply and distribution; trends; weed; weed control; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Food Supply; Government Programs; Government Regulation; Herbivory; Introduced Species; Plant Weeds; Public Policy; Risk Reduction Behavior; Species Specificity; Weed Control",,,,,"Steinfeld, H., (2006) Livestock's Long Shadow.

In reality, decision-makers do not have perfect foresight, and the endogenous driving force of technology adoption is uncertain. With a stylized optimization model, this paper explores the adoption of a new technology, its associated cost dynamics, and technological bifurcations with limited foresight and uncertain technological learning. The study shows that when modeling with limited foresight and technological learning, (1) the longer the length of the decision period, the earlier the adoption of a new technology, and the value of a foresight can be amplified with a high learning rate. However, when the decision period is beyond a certain length, further extending its length has little influence on adopting the new technology; (2) with limited foresight, decisions aiming at minimizing the total cost of each decision period will commonly result in a non-optimal solution from the perspective of the entire decision horizon; and (3) the range of technological bifurcation is much larger than that with perfect foresight, but uncertainty in technological learning tends to reduce the range by removing the early adoption paths of a new technology. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such approach has its limits as some clusters could undergo a drastic structural deformation upon gaining or losing one electron. By engaging symmetry-unrestricted density functional calculations with an extensive search among various structures for each size and state of charge, we addressed the investigation of the technologically relevant Cun and Ptn clusters for n = 2-14 atoms in the cationic, neutral, and anionic states to analyze the behavior of the structural, electronic, and energetic properties as a function of size and charge state. Moreover, we considered potentially high-energy isomers allowing foresight comparison with experimental results. Considering fixed cluster sizes, we found that distinct charge states lead to different structural geometries, revealing a clear tendency of decreasing average coordination as the electron density is increased. This behavior prompts significant changes in all considered properties, namely, energy gaps between occupied and unoccupied states, magnetic moment, detachment energy, ionization potential, center of gravity and ""bandwidth"" of occupied d-states, stability function, binding energy, electric dipole moment and sd hybridization. Furthermore, we identified a strong correlation between magic Pt clusters with peaks in sd hybridization index, allowing us to conclude that sd hybridization is one of the mechanisms for stabilization for Ptn clusters. Our results form a well-established basis upon which a deeper understanding of the stability and reactivity of metal clusters can be built, as well as the possibility to tune and exploit cluster properties as a function of size and charge. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding energy; Electric dipole moments; Ground state; Ionization potential; Isomers; Magnetic moments; Platinum; Center of gravity; Computational demands; Energetic properties; High-energy isomers; Stability function; Strong correlation; Structural deformation; Structural geometry; Atoms",,,,,"Baletto, F., Ferrando, R., Structural properties of nanoclusters: Energetic, thermodynamic, and kinetic effects (2005) Rev.

We critically examine key underlying assumptions in the debate, which is mainly preoccupied with certain dichotomous positions, the most prevalent being whether or not ‘real’ future orientation is uniquely human. We argue that future orientation is a theoretical construct threatening to lead research astray. Cognitive operations occur in the present moment and can be influenced only by prior causation and the environment, at the same time that most appear directed towards future outcomes. Regarding the current debate, future orientation becomes a question of where on various continua cognition becomes ‘truly’ future-oriented. We question both the assumption that episodic cognition is the most important process in future-oriented cognition and the assumption that future-oriented cognition is uniquely human. We review the studies on future-oriented cognition in the great apes to find little doubt that our closest relatives possess such ability. We conclude by urging that future-oriented cognition not be viewed as expression of some select set of skills. Instead, research into future-oriented cognition should be approached more like research into social and physical cognition. &copy; 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Planning and managing large-scale transitions in cities to deal with these pressures require an understanding of urban retrofitting at city scale. In this context performative techniques (such as backcasting and roadmapping) can provide valuable tools for helping cities develop a strategic view of the future. However, it is also important to identify 'disruptive' and 'sustaining' technologies which may contribute to city-based sustainability transitions. This paper presents research findings from the EPSRC Retrofit 2050 project, and explores the relationship between technology roadmaps and transition theory literature, highlighting the research gaps at urban/city level. The paper develops a research methodology to describe the development of three guiding visions for city-regional retrofit futures, and identifies key sustaining and disruptive technologies at city scale within these visions using foresight (horizon scanning) techniques. The implications of the research for city-based transition studies and related methodologies are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Cities; Energy; Low carbon; Retrofit; Roadmaps; Transition theory; Waste; Water","Carbon; Sustainable development; Wastes; Water; Cities; Energy; Low carbon; Retrofit; Road-maps; Transition theories; Retrofitting; emission control; innovation; learning; research method; sustainability; technological development; urban planning",,,,,"(2010) UN World Urbanization Prospects: The 2009 Revision, , UN, New York; (2007) City Planning Will Determine Pace of Global Warming, , http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/gaef3190.doc.htm, UN accessed April 2013; Hodson, M., Marvin, S., (2010) World Cities and Climate Change: Producing Ecological Security, , McGraw Hill, London; Glaeser, E., (2011) Triumph of the City, , Macmillan, UK; Dixon, T., (2012) Hotting Up?

The purpose of this report was to describe the successful treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a nonverbal 20-yearold male patient with ASD using a dental appliance. A series of appointments prepared the patient for the required treatment procedures and desensitized him for use of the final appliance. The final appliance improved outcomes of a post-treatment sleep study, indicating successful treatment of OSA. Understanding the specific challenges of patients with ASD and the patience and foresight of providers in approaching these challenges, in collaboration with caregivers, can contribute to improved health outcomes for these patients.","Developmental disabilities, autistic disorder; Sleep medicine specialty","biomedical and dental materials; polyvinyl derivative; siloxane; vinyl polysiloxane; autism; behavior therapy; case report; chemistry; complication; dental impression; dental procedure; devices; follow up; human; male; mandible reconstruction; mouth protector; orthodontic device; orthodontics; procedures; psychology; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; treatment outcome; young adult; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Dental Care for Disabled; Dental Impression Materials; Dental Impression Technique; Desensitization, Psychologic; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Mandibular Advancement; Mouth Protectors; Orthodontic Appliance Design; Orthodontic Appliances; Polyvinyls; Siloxanes; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,"Dental Impression Materials; Polyvinyls; Siloxanes; vinyl polysiloxane",,,"American Psychiatric Association, (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed.

Even though this development is not new, appropriate approaches to address this social trend are unfortunately still lacking. Within the German Foresight Process I, the field of 'aging research' was identified as one of seven new future fields whose potential for national scientific research and innovation activities has not yet been quantified. However, so far, current progress in policy, science and industry seems in some respects largely unconnected or isolated. This paper provides an overview of these activities in the work environment context, conducing analyses covering the use of innovation policy measures, the topic discussions in scientific publications and the realizations in corporate contexts. The aim is to provide an integrated picture of the state of the different concepts in the field of 'active aging' in the different sub areas of a 'national' innovation and technology system in the case of Germany.1 © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Active aging; Aging workforces; Bibliometric analysis; Demographic change; European manufacturing survey; Innovation and technology policy; Science","Employment; Human engineering; Population statistics; Aging workforce; Bibliometric analysis; Demographic changes; European manufacturing surveys; Innovation and technology; Science; Engineering research; aging; demographic trend; human capital; innovation; science and technology; technology policy; workplace; Germany",,,,,"Ácsa, Z.J., Autiob, E., Szerb, L., National systems of entrepreneurship: measurement issues and policy implications (2014) Res.

It focuses on foresight workshops as a means of opening up the foresight processes and enabling collaborative action. The chapter first introduces the basic procedure of foresight workshops. Then, it lays out the different stages in which a company can open up the foresight process and reasons why this pays off. The chapter also discusses pitfalls that companies must avoid in order to fully seize upon the potential of open foresight processes. It explains how to successfully plan and carry out an open foresight process. Finally, the chapter provides some thoughts on the use of open foresight workshops for opportunity identification. Various examples show how companies like Siemens, Greiner Perfoam, or Volkswagen implemented open foresight workshops and benefited from the positive effects of integrating external partners in their foresight processes. © 2014 Product Development and Management Association.

Thereby, we control for fiscal foresight, a specific limited information problem (LIP) by utilizing the narrative approach. Moreover, we surmount the generic LIP inherent in vector autoregressions (VARs) by a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) approach. We find that a positive deficit-financed defence shock raises output by more than in a VAR (e.g. 2.61 vs. 2.04 for peak multipliers). Furthermore, our evidence suggests that consumption is crowded in.

As such, they provide important, but only partial, pictures of how we might eat more sustainably. The complex politics underlying food production and distribution as well as factors that shape the highly uneven practices of food consumption are often obscured. Equally, and in the face of ongoing conflicts that suggest otherwise, supply-side analyses frequently assume that technological advances will play a relatively uncontested role in food futures. Drawing on insights from a participatory backcasting process that adopted a practice orientation within an overarching transitions framework, this paper adds two related dimensions to the productivist paradigm in urban food futures research. First, it places eating practices at the heart of food futures debates and second, it provides a critical reflection on consumer-citizen perceptions of the role for technology, and in particular ICT, in shaping those eating practices. Ultimately, it is argued that technological advances in production alone are unlikely to generate the significant transformations required to construct more sustainable urban future food landscapes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Food; Governance; Ireland; Participatory backcasting; Social practice; Transition management","consumption behavior; food supply; governance approach; information and communication technology; participatory approach; sustainable development; Ireland",,,,,"Belasco, W., (2012) Meals to Come: A History of the Future of Food, p. 3. , University of California Press, Berkeley, CA; Blake, J., Overcoming the 'value-action gap' in environmental policy: tensions between national policy and local experience (1999) Local Environ., 4, pp. 257-278; Blue, G., Food, public, science (2010) Public Underst.

Such analyses have typically been made under the assumption that future demographic developments are deterministic. When stochastic demographics have been considered, the problems have been simplified by assuming that the decision makers in the economic system behave as if they had perfect foresight as regards demographics. More realistically, we assume that the decision makers base their decisions on the forecasts of the future population, but revise their decisions when it turns out that the demographics do not follow the expected path. We contrast the nature of demographic uncertainty with that of financial markets, and argue that it is not realistic to assume that the revisions will occur according to the full rational expectations paradigm. Instead, the decision makers are assumed to revise according to the most recent point forecast. To implement this approach, we tailor standard nonparametric regression techniques to the task of computing the required future conditional expectations. Specifically, we assume that an approximation to the predictive distribution of the future population is available in terms of simulated population counts. The required conditional expectations are then obtained by averaging the future evolution of a set of sample paths that come from the neighborhood of a target path. This is formally equivalent to n-nearest neighbor kernel regression. The degree of smoothing can be chosen via cross-validation. An illustration based on a stochastic forecast of the population of Finland is given. © 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.","Conditional expectation; Forecast update; Population forecast; Rational expectations; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Alho, J.M., Stochastic methods in population forecasting (1990) International Journal of Forecasting, 6, pp. 521-530; Alho, J.M., Nonparametric estimation of conditional expectations for sustainability analyses (2014), ETLA Reports , Helsinki; (2008) Uncertain demographics and fiscal sustainability, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, J.M.

The first three core leadership points are strongly based on the theoretical model of Phipps (2012). The first core subject is a leader's personal spiritual beliefs, schema, or worldview. The existential worldview, as categorized by Koltko-Rivera (2004), shares the Christian worldview as a prototypical basis for servant leadership. The second core subject is a leader's constructive development or life experience, which shapes a leader's thinking (Phipps, 2012). This entails how a leader learns, processes, and makes meaning by reflecting on the school of personal experience, including trials and crucibles. The third core subject is more of a leader outcome, called meta-belief. A servant leader utilizes meta-belief or self-awareness in order to make choices in particular places and contexts. Finally, the fourth core essential subject that is evident to followers of servant leaders is vision and hope. A hopeful leader is always optimistically looking ahead with foresight, knowing what has taken place in both the past and present. © 2015, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Argyris, C., Teaching smart people how to learn (2002) Reflections: The SoL Journal, 4 (2), pp. 4-15; Avolio, B., Gardner, W., Authentic leadership development: Getting to the root of positive forms of leadership (2005) The Leadership Quarterly, 16 (3), pp. 315-338; Avolio, B.J., Gardner, W.L., Walumbwa, F.O., Luthans, F.L., May, D.R., Unlocking the mask: A look at the process by which authentic leaders impact follower attitudes and behaviors (2004) The Leadership Quarterly, 15 (6), pp. 801-823; Avolio, B.J., Luthans, F.L., (2006) The high impact leader: Moments matter in accelerating authentic leadership development, , New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Bass, B.M., Bass, R., (2008) The Bass handbook of leadership: Theory, research, and managerial applications, , (4th ed.).

The scenarios suggest three main leverage approaches: (1) Physical and chemical utilisation of CO2 to yield long-lasting products through immobilisation; (2) Overall increase in process efficiency; (3) Renewable and decarbonised energy injection in the current infrastructures, as well as a switch to more carbon-sober fuels. CO2 utilisation appears to a have a potential role to play in all of these approaches. Several examples will be discussed in this chapter, among which will be: accelerated carbonation of industrial wastes, the role of CO2 hydrogenation catalysts for short-term injection of renewable energy in the current energy grid, the importance of electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol and methane, among others, and the relevance of air capture as a long-term solution once massive deployment of CO2 utilisation industries has occurred. Within each section, we have attempted to show a hierarchy of the several components in a possible timeframe of deployment. If these are the strong lines of potentially relevant technologies, prediction with 35year foresight necessitates great caution. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To assist understanding of future adaptation pathways, this paper used ethnographic approaches to understand past pathways of response to major social and political change over the last seven decades in a rural Transylvanian community. The results identified five main socio-ethnic groups that had different pathways of response to key periods of change. These periods provided different constraints and opportunities, and shaped the accumulation and loss of different categories of assets for each socio-ethnic group. Findings show that adaptation is an ongoing process in which responses and decisions are patterned along multiple, socially contingent trajectories with continuities and legacies. Importantly, while the different groups had interrelated pathways, these were associated with a powerful normative pathway that was implicated in producing and reinforcing local social hierarchies. In this case, the normative pathway was a mix of practicing subsistence agriculture and small scale flexible income generation. The nuanced understanding of the change and response dynamics in the village provide important insights for anticipating responses to, and the impacts of, future change. It also highlights the need for holistic and multi-perspective approaches when developing and implementing adaptation pathways. These approaches should responsibly and carefully consider the implications of particular future paths for all concerned, but especially for those that are the most marginalized in society. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation pathways; Assets; Ethnicity; Romania; Subsistence farming; Vulnerability","adaptation; decision making; ethnicity; future prospect; holistic approach; political change; rural population; social change; subsistence agriculture; vulnerability; Romania; Transylvania",,,,,"Adger, W.N., Vulnerability (2006) Global Environ.

In this light, the effectiveness of past commonly-accepted approaches to soil and water conservation are often found to have been inadequate. In many cases they have tackled symptoms of land degradation without appreciating fully the background causes, which often relate to inadequate matching of land-use/land-management with features of the landscape. A number of reasons for this mismatch are suggested. Understanding the ecological background to land husbandry (as defined below) will improve the effectiveness of attempts to tackle land degradation. In particular, an ecologically based approach to better land husbandry helps to foresee potential problems in some detail, so that appropriate forward planning can be undertaken to avoid them. This paper describes some practical ways of undertaking an appropriate survey of significant landscape features, enabling the definition and mapping of discrete areas of different land-use incapability classes. This is accompanied by an example of how the outcome was interpreted and used to guide the selection of appropriate areas which were apparently suitable for growing flue-cured tobacco within an area of ca. 140 km2 in Malawi. This process relied on knowledge and experience in various disciplines (interpretation of air-photos, topographic survey, soil survey, vegetation analysis, hydrology, soil &amp; water conservation, geology, agronomy) so as to ensure that the mapping process was based on the principles of better land husbandry. © 2014 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water & Power Press","Agro-ecology; Foresight; Land-use incapability; Soil & water conservation",,,,,,"Bennett, H.H., Soil Conservation (1939), p. 993. , McGraw-Hill London & New York; Boorman, D.B., Hollis, J.M., Lilly, A., Hydrology of soil types: a hydrologically-based classification of the soils of United Kingdom.

A key question is whether shared cognitive phenotypes are based on common or different underlying pathophysiologies and whether comorbid patients have additive neurofunctional deficits, resemble one of the disorders or have a different pathophysiology. We compared age- and IQ-matched boys with non-comorbid ADHD (18), non-comorbid ASD (15), comorbid ADHD and ASD (13) and healthy controls (18) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a temporal discounting task. Only the ASD and the comorbid groups discounted delayed rewards more steeply. The fMRI data showed both shared and disorder-specific abnormalities in the three groups relative to controls in their brain-behaviour associations. The comorbid group showed both unique and more severe brain-discounting associations than controls and the non-comorbid patient groups in temporal discounting areas of ventromedial and lateral prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum and anterior cingulate, suggesting that comorbidity is neither an endophenocopy of the two pure disorders nor an additive pathology. © 2014 The Authors.","ADHD; ASD; Autism; FMRI; Temporal discounting","anterior cingulate; article; attention deficit disorder; autism; Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised; clinical article; cognitive defect; comorbidity; controlled study; corpus striatum; delay discounting; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; juvenile; male; neuroimaging; neuropathology; phenotype; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; adolescent; attention deficit disorder; autism; brain; case control study; child; cingulate gyrus; female; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; psychology; reward; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autistic Disorder; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Comorbidity; Delay Discounting; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prefrontal Cortex; Reward",,,,,"Brammer, M.J., Bullmore, E.T., Simmons, A., Williams, S.C.R., Grasby, P.M., Howard, R.J., Woodruff, P.W.R., Rabe-Hesketh, S., Generic brain activation mapping in functional magnetic resonance imaging: a nonparametric approach (1997) Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 15, pp. 763-770; Bullmore, E., Long, C., Suckling, J., Fadili, J., Calvert, G., Zelaya, F., Carpenter, T.A., Brammer, M., Colored noise and computational inference in neurophysiological (fMRI) time series analysis: resampling methods in time and wavelet domains (2001) Human Brain Mapping, 12, pp. 61-78; Bullmore, E.T., Suckling, J., Overmeyer, S., Rabe-Hesketh, S., Taylor, E., Brammer, M.J., Global, voxel, and cluster tests, by theory and permutation, for a difference between two groups of structural MR images of the brain (1999) IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 18, pp. 32-42; Bush, G., Vogt, B.A., Holmes, J., Dale, A.M., Greve, D., Jenike, M.A., Rosen, B.R., Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex: a role in reward-based decision making (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99, pp. 523-528; Cardinal, R.N., Neural systems implicated in delayed and probabilistic reinforcement (2006) Neural Networks, 19, pp. 1277-1301; Christakou, A., Brammer, M., Rubia, K., Maturation of limbic corticostriatal activation and connectivity associated with developmental changes in temporal discounting (2011) Neuroimage, 54, pp. 1344-1354; Christakou, A., Murphy, C.M., Chantiluke, K., Cubillo, A.I., Smith, A.B., Giampietro, V., Daly, E., Rubia, K., Disorder-specific functional abnormalities during sustained attention in youth with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and with Autism (2013) Molecular Psychiatry, 18, pp. 236-244; Conners, C.K., Sitarenios, G., Parker, J.D.A., Epstein, J.N., The Revised Conners[U+05F3] Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-R): factor structure, reliability, and criterion validity (1998) Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 26, pp. 257-268; Critchfield, T.S., Kollins, S.H., Temporal discounting: basic research and the analysis of socially important behavior (2001) Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 34, pp. 101-122; Cubillo, A., Halari, R., Smith, A., Taylor, E., Rubia, K., A review of fronto-striatal and fronto-cortical brain abnormalities in children and adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and new evidence for dysfunction in adults with ADHD during motivation and attention (2012) Cortex, 48, pp. 194-215; Demurie, E., Roeyers, H., Baeyens, D., Sonuga-Barke, E., Temporal discounting of monetary rewards in children and adolescents with ADHD and autism spectrum disorders (2012) Developmental Science, 15, pp. 791-800; Di Martino, A., Ross, K., Uddin, L.Q., Sklar, A.B., Castellanos, F.X., Milham, M.P., Functional brain correlates of social and nonsocial processes in autism spectrum disorders: an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis (2009) Biological Psychiatry, 65, pp. 63-74; Dichter, G.S., Felder, J.N., Green, S.R., Rittenberg, A.M., Sasson, N.J., Bodfish, J.W., Reward circuitry function in autism spectrum disorders (2012) Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 7, pp. 160-172; Geurts, H.M., Vertie, S., Oosterlaan, J., Roeyers, H., Sergeant, J.A., How specific are executive functioning deficits in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism?

Present study aimed to identify, catalogue and document the large number of medicinal plants used in traditional medicine in Soan Valley, Salt Range, Pakistan. Materials and methods Informal interviews were conducted involving a total of 255 villagers (155 male and 65 female and 35 herbalists) to elicit the knowledge and use of medicinal plants. Results Local communities possessed knowledge of fifty eight (58) medicinal plant species belonging to thirty five (35) families to treat fifteen ailment categories. Whole plant and leaves were the most frequently used plant parts (24%) followed by seed (14%), root (12%), flower (7%), bulb (6%), fruit (4%), stem (3%), latex and rhizome (2%) and sap and gum (1%). Frequently used growth forms of medicinal plants were wild herbs (63%) followed by cultivated herbs (14%), wild trees (11%), wild shrubs (10%) and wild and cultivated herbs (2%). Preparations were administrated generally through oral and topical routes. Local people were familiar mostly with the species in order to deal common ailments particularly cough, cold, digestive problems, fever, headache, and skin infections. Complex ailments were treated by traditional healers. Justica adhatoda, Olea ferruginea, Amaranthus viridis and Mentha royleana were identified as plants with high use value (UV). Conclusions This study revealed that the area harbors high diversity of medicinal flora. Despite gradual socio-cultural transformation, local communities still hold ample knowledge of plants and their uses. The reliance on traditional medicines was associated with the lack of modern health care facilities, poverty and the traditional belief of their effectiveness. Medicinal plants play a significant role in management of various human diseases in the study area. A high degree of consensus among the informants was an indicative that plant use and knowledge were still strong, and preservation of this knowledge showed good foresight in the future. Awareness was thus needed to be raised among local people on sustainable utilization and management of plant resources. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Unfortunately, nobody has thought to pave the road to success. Although failure can be discouraging and time-consuming, it presents incredible learning opportunities—the biggest difference between those who succeed and those who abandon their projects lies in their response to adversity. This article reviews events undertaken by the Regional Student Groups (RSGs) in India and Argentina, the problems they encountered, and what can be learned from them. RSG-India attempted to organize an online scientific meeting (also known as a virtual conference) with geographically dispersed stakeholders, a totally new concept for them. RSG-Argentina tackled the challenge of organizing a two-day symposium, their first event ever. Some of the complications they faced were easy to fix, others led to the cancellation of activities, and all of them resulted in valuable lessons. The main goal of this article is to highlight, through their experiences, the universal importance of a healthy panel of contingency plans. © 2014 Mishra et al.",,"Argentina; human; human experiment; India; learning; student; thinking; biology; education; interpersonal communication; leadership; organization; organization and management; Argentina; Communication; Computational Biology; Congresses as Topic; Humans; India; Leadership; Learning; Students",,,,,,"Abeel, T.; Broad Institute of MIT and HarvardUnited States; email: tabeel@broadinstitute.org",,,"Public Library of Science",,,,,1553734X,,,"25101799","English","PLoS Comput.

The development of a “Global Change Data Base” (GCDB) promises a graphically and geographically oriented tool for the representation of correlations for global long-term data series. Design/methodology/approach – A literature analysis supports the interpretation of such “pattern recognitions”, especially the literature in the areas of economic growth, systems analysis, energy economics, social indicators and quality of life. Preconditions for economic growth are empirically analysed on a sectoral level along with prevailing structural shifts in the use of energy sources. Findings – The main outcome is a distillate of a few formative “paths of development”, according to a synthesis of to-date growth theories. These lines might influence development in future decades and co-determine the degree to which sustainability targets are met. Debates and discussion procedures make use of such findings and outline modes of actions. Practical implications – Developmental university curricula such as “Global Studies”, democratisation endeavours based on analyses of economic performance of (partly) democratic systems or global governance of science could profit from a consensus on global trends patterns, similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change endeavour at the United Nations level. Social implications – Such heuristic methods could suitably mediate (in “multicultural” manner) between contradictory paradigms of global economic development that are mainly ideology-driven and hamper global society’s joint action. Originality/value – In short, this is an empirical work on pattern recognition in global evolution using aggregated spatially and temporally enabled data. It refers to the historic example of Kon-Tiki which undertook a surprisingly long journey based on precise knowledge of ocean currents and wind without applying own force. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Energy; Forecast; Foresight; Forward looking; Futurology; Global change; Global Change Data Base; Global governance; Global Studies; Kon-Tiki; Long-term trends; Socio-economy",,,,,,"Acemoğlu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J.A., Reversal of fortune: Geography and institutions in the making of the modern world income distribution (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (3), pp. 1231-1294; Ades, A.F., Glaeser, E.L., Evidence on growth, increasing returns, and the extent of the market (1999) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114 (3), pp. 1025-1045; Ahamer, G., Global energy use and land use change in agriculture (1996) Macroeconomic and Agricultural Aspects of CO2 Emission, pp. 51-66. , in Hofreiter, M.F. and Sinabell, F, WissenschaftsverlagVauk, Kiel; Ahamer, G., Schleicher, S., Read, P., A dynamics-as-usual development as border condition for the implementation of global biomass energy strategies (1996) Proceedings of the 9Th European Bioenergy Conference, pp. 793-798. , Copenhagen, Pergamon Press, Elsevier Science; Ahamer, G., (1997) Energie- Und Emissionsbilanzierung für Österreichs Städte - Fallstudie für Graz, Monographien, Band M-084, 562 Pages, Federal Environment Agency =Umweltbundesamt, , www.umweltbundesamt.at/publikationen/publikationssuche/publikationsdetail/?&pub_id=887, Wien; Ahamer, G., Supply and demand in energy and agriculture: Emitters of CO2 and possibilities for global biomass energy strategies (1997) World Resource Review, 9 (4), pp. 491-507. , www.globalwarming.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=41&Itemid=5; Ahamer, G., (1998) Klimamodelle and Klimawandel.

Nanotechnology in agriculture has gained momentum in the last decade with an abundance of public funding, but the pace of development is modest, even though many disciplines come under the umbrella of agriculture. This could be attributed to: a unique nature of farm production, which functions as an open system whereby energy and matter are exchanged freely; the scale of demand of input materials always being gigantic in contrast with industrial nanoproducts; an absence of control over the input nanomaterials in contrast with industrial nanoproducts (eg, the cell phone) and because their fate has to be conceived on the geosphere (pedosphere)-biosphere-hydrosphere-atmosphere continuum; the time lag of emerging technologies reaching the farmers' field, especially given that many emerging economies are unwilling to spend on innovation; and the lack of foresight resulting from agricultural education not having attracted a sufficient number of brilliant minds the world over, while personnel from kindred disciplines might lack an understanding of agricultural production systems. If these issues are taken care of, nanotechnologic intervention in farming has bright prospects for improving the efficiency of nutrient use through nanoformulations of fertilizers, breaking yield barriers through bionanotechnology, surveillance and control of pests and diseases, understanding mechanisms of host-parasite interactions at the molecular level, development of new-generation pesticides and their carriers, preservation and packaging of food and food additives, strengthening of natural fibers, removal of contaminants from soil and water, improving the shelf-life of vegetables and flowers, clay-based nanoresources for precision water management, reclamation of salt-affected soils, and stabilization of erosionprone surfaces, to name a few. © 2014 Mukhopadhyay.","Clay minerals; Crop production; Crop protection; Farming; Food; Nanocomposites; Nanofabrication; Nanotechnology","fossil fuel; nanocomposite; nanomaterial; agriculture; clay; crop production; crop protection; farming system; food industry; irrigation (agriculture); nanofabrication; nanotechnology; review; sustainable agriculture",,,,,"Roco, M.C., Towards a US national nanotechnology initiative (1999) J Nanopart Res, 1, pp. 435-438; (2002) Nanoscale science and engineering for agriculture and food systems.

These activities include developing a strategy, creating innovations, managing risk, and exploring new markets. The author identifies five challenges that companies may face when developing corporate foresight, which include the detection of signals that yield a competitive advantage, the detection of change when terminology is unclear, and the selection of an appropriate foresight method as well as the successful use of foresight methods in the highly iterative front end of innovation. Monitoring and scanning are two ways of conducting the search, with intelligent data mining and scouting networks as possible approaches.

As a first step, four scenarios for the future and corresponding strategic options were developed and served as a framework for 'wind tunneling' Volkswagen's existing innovation strategy. These white spots served as a starting point for further discussion and development with the intention of identifying promising fields of future innovation. The so-called 'information market' - an online-based real-time trading market - was the method of choice for reaching this target. Experts from all departments of Volkswagen Group Research were invited to take part in the information market to share their knowledge. The project showed that the approach of combining open innovation and foresight is able to serve both the long-term strategic requirements of a large organization and the more short-term need of fostering innovation. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Design/methodology/approach – The research employs a mixed-methods approach and triangulates the identification of themes through, consultation with five industry experts, 23 individual interviews and 169 survey respondents. Findings – A linear composite that explains 41.4 percent of the variance in boredom-coping (r=0.66, p<0.001) was developed. The model was derived from four constructs identified from primary qualitative data. These were, personality traits (i.e. conscientiousness, openness, work ethic, and extraversion), attitude to challenge, trainable abilities (i.e. practical intelligence, foresight ability, and situational awareness), and group potency. Research limitations/implications – These findings provide research implications for the study of boredom-coping at work. Common-method artifacts are a potential limitation of the conclusions drawn. However, the mixed-methods approach, independent samples at each stage, and multiple data collection sites and times, supports the integrity of the findings discussed. Practical implications – The practical implications of this research includes providing strategies for human resource decisions associated with recruitment, selection, and front-line training interventions. The model indicates training may be targeted at different areas of the equation with markedly different impact and return depending on the timed nature of interventions. Originality/value – The findings support the development of approaches that may help to create a more engaged, productive, and well-adjusted workforce. The translation of the findings to the “bottomline” is also significant. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Attitude to challenge; Boredom-coping; Conscientiousness; Group potency; Mixed methodologies; Practical intelligence; Situational awareness",,,,,,"Alsan, A., Corporate foresight in emerging markets: Action research at a multinational company in Turkey (2008) Futures, 40 (1), pp. 47-55; Ashkanasy, N.M., Daus, C.S., Emotion in the workplace: The new challenge for managers (2002) Academy of Management Executive, 16 (1), pp. 76-86; Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, (2009) Australian Mineral Statistics, , June quarter, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Canberra; Bakker, A.B., Bal, P.M., Weekly work engagement and performance: A study among starting teachers (2010) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83 (1), pp. 189-206; Bakker, A.B., Xanthopoulou, D., The crossover of daily work engagement: Test of an ACTOR-partner interdependence model (2009) Journal of Applied Psychology, 94 (6), pp. 1562-1571; Bandura, A., (1977) Social Learning Theory, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , W.H.

GTECH S.p.A. knows this very well as a leading developer of gaming products that range from slot machines, to sports betting, to interactive lotteries. The company designs, manufactures and distributes games, machine cabinets, central systems and associated software through its SPIELO product brand. GTECH also continuously looks for ways to improve plant operations. At its Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada, facility, for example, the company recently replaced its method of tracking production and product quality. The production of a gaming machine starts with downloading a work order and the bill of materials (BOM) from an enterprise resource planning system, which then schedules and releases parts to production based on priority, part availability and other factors. Once a work order is released, operators can clearly see the BOM on their screens and distinguish between noncritical and critical parts.",,"Assembly; Industrial engineering; Associated softwares; Bill of materials; Central systems; Enterprise resource planning systems; Gaming machines; Plant operations; Work order; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Camillo, J.",,,"Assembly Headquarters",,,,,10508171,,ASMYE,,"English","Assembly",Short Survey,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903847041

Such phenomena result in integration among disparate technology fields. At this point, it is a critical research issue to understand the different roles and the propensity of each element technology for technological convergence. In particular, the network-based approach provides a holistic view in terms of technological linkage structures. Furthermore, the development of new indicators based on network visualization can reveal the dynamic patterns among disparate technologies in the process of technological convergence and provide insights for future technological developments. This research attempts to analyze and discover the patterns of the international patent classification codes of the United States Patent and Trademark Office's patent data in printed electronics, which is a representative technology in the technological convergence process. To this end, we apply the physical idea as a new methodological approach to interpret technological convergence. More specifically, the concepts of entropy and gravity are applied to measure the activities among patent citations and the binding forces among heterogeneous technologies during technological convergence. By applying the entropy and gravity indexes, we could distinguish the characteristic role of each technology in printed electronics. At the technological convergence stage, each technology exhibits idiosyncratic dynamics which tend to decrease technological differences and heterogeneity. Furthermore, through nonlinear regression analysis, we have found the decreasing patterns of disparity over a given total period in the evolution of technological convergence. This research has discovered the specific role of each element technology field and has consequently identified the coevolutionary patterns of technological convergence. These new findings on the evolutionary patterns of technological convergence provide some implications for engineering and technology foresight research, as well as for corporate strategy and technology policy. © 2014 Cho, Kim.",,"article; citation analysis; classification; conceptual framework; convergent evolution; dynamics; electronics; engineering; entropy; evolution; force; gravity; methodology; nonlinear regression analysis; patent; policy; research; technology; United States; legislation and jurisprudence; technology; theoretical model; Models, Theoretical; Patents as Topic; Technology",,,,,"Bores, C., Saurina, C., Torres, R., Technological convergence: A strategic perspective (2003) Technovation, 23, pp. 1-13; Islam, N., Miyazaki, K., Nanotechnology innovation system: Understanding hidden dynamics of nanoscience fusion trajectories (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76 (1), pp. 128-140; Hacklin, F., Management of convergence in innovation: Strategies and capabilities for value creation beyond blurring industry boundaries (2008) Contributions to Management Science, , Heidelberg: Springer; Hacklin, F., Marxt, C., Fahrni, F., Coevolutionary cycles of convergence: An extrapolation from the ICT industry (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76 (6), pp. 723-736; Vasconcellos, A.G., Morel, C.M., Enabling Policy Planning and Innovation Management through Patent Information and Co-Authorship Network Analyses: A Study of Tuberculosis in Brazil (2012) PLoS ONE, 7 (10), pp. e45569; Tinnemann, P., Özbay, J., Saint, V.A., Willich, S.N., Patenting of University and Non-University Public Research Organisations in Germany: Evidence from Patent Applications for Medical Research Results (2010) PLoS ONE, 5 (11), pp. e14059; Bauer, J.M., Weijnen, M.P.C., Turk, A.L., Herder, P.M., Delineating the Scope of Convergence in Infrastructures: New Frontiers for Competition (2003) Critical Infrastructures: State of the Art in Research and Application, pp. 209-231. , Thissen W.

Climatic extremes, like Sandy, are projected to increase in magnitude and frequency, calling upon societies to adapt appropriately to imminent threats. In this paper, we describe the knowledge and policy disconnect exposed by Sandy between what we submit are four key elements of adaptive capacity: resources, institutions, knowledge and innovation of technology. Our synthesis of multi-disciplinary expert knowledge and admonition from civil engineers, climatologists, and urban planners demonstrates the significance of mobilizing knowledge to design robust socio-ecological systems. We contrast the U.S. model to the Dutch system of climate adaptation to emphasize the feasibility, value, and effectiveness of adopting robust adaptive capacities, rather than policies steeped in reactionary responses. Such strategies that integrate coordination and imagination from members across society are imperative in translating scientific foresight into institutional action. The solution we offer is not only material for a more action-based discussion, but also provides an illustration of crafting policy that enhances adaptive capacities of socio-ecological systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Hurricane sandy; Science and policy; Socio-ecological systems","adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; hurricane event; innovation; knowledge; United States",,,,,"Adger, W.N., Vulnerability, Global Environmental Change (2006), 16, pp. 268-281; Adger, W.N., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Carpenter, S.R., Rockström, J., Social-ecological resilience to coastal disasters (2005) Science, 309 (5737), pp. 1036-1039; Aerts, J.C., Botzen, W.J., Hill, D., Bowman, M.J., Khinda, J.S., Climate adaptation cost for flood risk management in the Netherlands (2013) Storm surge barriers to protect New York City: Against the deluge, pp. 99-113. , American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), New York University, USA; Aerts, J.C., Botzen, W., Veen, A., Krywkow, J., Werners, S., Dealing with uncertainty in flood management through diversification.

This study integrated social capital theory, social cognitive theory, and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to develop a comprehensive behavioral model for analyzing the relationships among social capital factors (social capital theory), technological factors (TAM), and system self-efficacy (social cognitive theory) in telehealth. The proposed framework was validated with 365 respondents from Nantou County, located in Central Taiwan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the causal relationships that were hypothesized in the proposed model. The finding indicates that elderly residents generally reported positive perceptions toward the telehealth system. Generally, the findings show that social capital factors (social trust, institutional trust, and social participation) significantly positively affect the technological factors (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness respectively), which influenced usage intention. This study also confirmed that system self-efficacy was the salient antecedent of perceived ease of use. In addition, regarding the samples, the proposed model fitted considerably well. The proposed integrative psychosocial-technological model may serve as a theoretical basis for future research and can also offer empirical foresight to practitioners and researchers in the health departments of governments, hospitals, and rural communities. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Institutional trust; Social participation; Social trust; System self-efficacy; Technology acceptance model; Telehealth","cognition; health care; health services; rural area; social capital; social participation; technology adoption; theoretical study; aged; article; controlled study; female; health care delivery; human; integrating social capital theory; intermethod comparison; male; nonbiological model; organizational downsizing; organizational efficiency; process development; psychometry; quality control; self concept; social attitude; social capital; Social Cognitive Theory; social interaction; structural equation modeling; Technology Acceptance Model; telehealth; validation process; very elderly; cognition; consumer; health behavior; questionnaire; rural population; social capital; sociological theory; Taiwan; technology; telemedicine; theoretical model; Nantou; Taiwan; Cognition; Consumer Participation; Health Behavior; Models, Theoretical; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Rural Population; Self Efficacy; Social Capital; Social Theory; Taiwan; Technology; Telemedicine",,,,,"Huang, J.C., Innovative health care delivery system-A questionnaire survey to evaluate the influence of behavioral factors on individuals' acceptance of telecare (2013) Comput.

This chapter focuses on forms of coastal flood defence and approaches in the United Kingdom (UK). The UK-government-arranged Foresight Project provides more information on future flood and coastal defences in the UK, and uses theories to assess the possible scale and nature of future risks of coastal erosion, and assess options for responding to those risks. The chapter discusses the strategy of managed retreat, and the challenges arising from climate change and sea-level rise, changing populations, land management and development. All aspects of flood risk management should be carried out in a proportionate way that reflects the size and complexity of the risk and society's ability to manage it. Investment in managing risk, and who pays for it, should reflect the benefits that result. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

One potentially useful tool is life-cycle assessment (LCA), which is a comprehensive framework used to evaluate the environmental impacts of products, processes, and technologies. However, LCA ineffectively promotes RRI for at least two reasons: (1) Codified approaches to LCA are largely retrospective, relying heavily on data collected from mature industries with existing supply chains and (2) LCA underemphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement to inform critical modeling decisions which diminishes the social credibility and relevance of results. LCA researchers have made piecemeal advances that address these shortcomings, yet there is no consensus regarding how to advance LCA to support RRI of emerging technologies. This paper advocates for development of anticipatory LCA as non-predictive and inclusive of uncertainty, which can be used to explore both reasonable and extreme-case scenarios of future environmental burdens associated with an emerging technology. By identifying the most relevant uncertainties and engaging research and development decision-makers, such anticipatory methods can generate alternative research agenda and provide a practicable tool to promote environmental RRI. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","anticipation;

The Drugs 2020 study aimed at foreseeing changes in the drug situation in Finland by the year 2020.Methods: The Delphi method was used, utilizing drug experts of the EU national network in Finland.Results: Marked growth was foreseen in drug use, especially in synthetic designer drugs and misuse of medicinal drugs. Significant increase was also expected in growing cannabis at home. However, the control of drug market was expected to shift more into the hands of organized crime. No consensus was reached on how drug prices will develop in the time period. Drug use is likely to remain punishable although the use and possession of cannabis may be treated less severely. It seems likely that health and social services resources will be directed towards medicinal treatment.Conclusions: Foresight can be utilized in preparing for the future; desirable developments can be fostered, and measures can be taken to curb probable but undesirable lines of development. Based on the results of this study, the experts' view is that it is highly likely that the Finnish society will have to prepare for an increase in the demand for drug-related care, both in terms of content of the care and financing the services. Also, the forecasted increase in the role of legal prescription medicine used as intoxicants will call for efforts not only in changing prescription practices but in border and police control measures, as well. Parallel developments have been foreseen in the UK and Sweden, and it is likely that similar trends will actualize also in other western countries. © 2014 Lintonen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Drug policy; Expert panel; Foresight","street drug; advisory committee; consensus; Delphi study; drug control; drug utilization; Finland; health care delivery; human; legislation and jurisprudence; longitudinal study; management; Substance-Related Disorders; trends; Advisory Committees; Consensus; Delivery of Health Care; Delphi Technique; Drug and Narcotic Control; Drug Utilization; Finland; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Policy Making; Street Drugs; Substance-Related Disorders",,"Street Drugs",,,"(2013) EMCDDA Statistical bulletin, , http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats13, Lisbon: EMCDDA, The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction; (2013) Yearbook of alcohol and drug statistics 2013, , Helsinki: National Institute for Health and Welfare, National Institute for Health and Welfare; Tanhua, H., Virtanen, A., Knuuti, U., Leppo, A., Kotovirta, E., (2011) Finland - Drug Situation 2011.

We assume a piecewise linear money demand function, decreasing over a normal range (-a R, a L) and constant when the expected inflation rate is beyond these bounds. In this way, we obtain that the monetary dynamics are described by a one-dimensional map having two kink points. We show that when the slope of the money demand function (μ) is sufficiently large in absolute value and the speed of adjustment of the price to the market disequilibrium (α) is smaller than 1 either cycles of any period or chaotic dynamics may be generated by the model.

The evolutionary one-to-many game is presented to model the public opinion spread process between the agent and its neighbors. In this game, the population dynamics is utilized to update the neighbors' strategy. Then the game is integrated into the SIS model to construct the public opinion propagation model. The computer simulation results on the BBV network verified the effectiveness of this model from the key aspects of social deterrence, individual thought (thought depth and foresight extent) and weight factor. The network topology also has important influence on the model.

Given demographic projections and foresight reports, the question is raised whether there are limits to the meat consumption. Based on data from 120 countries, this article analyses the evolution of meat consumption in general and the relationship between meat consumption and income in particular. The study shows evidence for an inverted U-shaped relationship between meat consumption and income, meaning that - at a certain level of income - average meat consumption will stagnate or even decline. The results can help policy makers to develop incentives for both environmental and health policies and offers stakeholders opportunities for further research and innovation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Income; Meat consumption; Nutrition transition","article; catering service; consumer attitude; cost; cultural anthropology; developing country; economic development; environmental impact; femininity; food intake; health care policy; human; income; individuality; interdisciplinary research; masculinity; meta analysis (topic); nutrition; nutritional value; priority journal; public relations; red meat; religion",,,,,"Allais, O., Bertail, P., Nichèle, V., The effects of a fat tax on French households' purchases: a nutritional approach (2010) Am.

Designed as a multi-faceted project, this book presents an integrated assessment covering a wide range of policy areas and alternative assumptions about trends in global and European governance. In order to reach this ambitious objective in a comprehensive and consistent way, several types of quantitative and qualitative approaches have been combined: a model of macro regions of the world economy, an institutional perspective, and lessons from foresight studies. With a strong focus on policy implications, the book is introduced by an executive summary which outlines the project assumptions, especially on the future of Europe in the context of the current economic crisis and of the emergence of a new balance of powers in the global economy. Subsequent chapters cover the regulation of finance, trade and technology developments, environmental sustainability, employment conditions and population wellbeing. The book concludes with an assessment of the extent to which these developments are likely to lead to significant political changes in Europe. In sum this book challenges public policy makers to re-assess their thinking in shaping Europe's future. © The editors and contributors 2014.

Contextual intelligence is described as the ability to recognize patterns of interrelated artifacts inherent in events or circumstances, which result in intentional behaviors that facilitate influence. This chapter is divided into sections that introduce the concept of contextual intelligence as a framework rooted in three core concepts. Those concepts include understanding non- Newtonian thinking, synchronicity, and tacit knowledge. Following a discussion of these core concepts, the model is expanded to include three-dimensional (3D) thinking, which requires the practical application of hindsight, insight, and foresight through the lenses of the three core concepts.

Technocratic PP denotes the coexistence, or coproduction, of technocracy with PP - a complex ensemble of technocratic, precautionary policies, and hybrids of the two. This paper analyzes four types of PP-based policies linked to Korean GMO regulations: foresight and monitoring of risk; reverse burden of proof; public participation; and the public's right to know. Korean GMO regulations are consistent with the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, a type of PP, but lack long-term risk assessment as well as public participation. Technocracy is embedded both in advance informed agreements as a reverse burden of proof and in proof-based GMO labeling as a right-to-know policy. Technocratic PP results in inconsistencies between PP and technocratic epistemology and the gap between PP-based institutions and technocratic practices. Technocratic PP is therefore a typical phenomenon that occurs in the ""glocalization"" of risk regulation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Genetically modified organisms; Precautionary principle; Technocracy","article; biosafety; biotechnology; conceptual framework; consensus; content analysis; decision making; epistemology; food packaging; foresight and monitoring; genetic regulation; genetically modified food; government; human; human cloning; informed consent; Korea; law; nonhuman; policy; politics; precautionary principle; priority journal; public participation; reverse burden of proof; right to know; risk assessment; semi structured interview; stem cell research; technocracy; toxicity testing; transgenic organism; transgenic plant",,,,,"Cho, S.E., Kim, S.H., Institutions, interests, and ideas as determinants of public policy: A comparative analysis of gmo labeling policies in the eu, south korea, and the us (2006) Korea Journal of Public Administration, 44 (3), pp. 121-152; Choi, S.H., A proposal for the legal and institutional improvement of gmo labeling in korea (2008) Farmers and Society, 48, pp. 38-55; Costanza, R., Cornwell, L., The 4p approach to dealing with scientific uncertainty (1992) Environment, 34 (9), pp. 12-42; Daley, S., (2000) More and More, Europeans Find Fault with US: Wide Range of Events Viewed As Menacing, , New York Times, April 9; Fischer, F., (2000) Citizens, Experts, and the Environment: The Politics of Local Knowledge, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Fisher, E., Jones, J., Schomberg, R.V., (2006) Implementing the Precautionary Principle: Perspectives and Prospect, , Northampton, MA Edward Elgar Publishing; Geiser, K., Cleaner production and the precautionary principle (1999) Protecting Public Health & the Environment: Implementing the Precautionary Principle, pp. 323-336. , edited by C.

To overcome this biased perception, this paper shows the potential of foresight for dealing with tourism development issues burdened by complexity and uncertainty, as well as its capability to bring down analysis from global challenges to local and spatial implications. A model framework is presented to incorporate foresight studies into the process of planning and designing tourist destinations. The model facilitates a gradual transition from a narrative vision to the spatial design of a future destination. Stakeholders play a very important role in the proposed model, being involved throughout the process in identifying future trends, formulating visions and helping to design urban patterns. In order to facilitate stakeholders' involvement, various analytical and design tools are used to envision the future development of tourist destinations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Destination design; Foresight; Futures studies; Strategic planning; Vision design","design; spatial analysis; stakeholder; strategic approach; tourism development; tourism management; tourist destination",,,,,"Abott, J., Understanding and managing the unknown: the nature of uncertainty in planning (2005) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 24, pp. 237-251; (2010) Hotels 2020: Beyond segmentation, , http://www.amadeus.com, Amadeus, [pdf document].

It motivates activities designed to build capacities in foresight, engagement, and integration - as well as through their production ensemble. These capacities encourage and support the reflection of scientists, engineers, policy makers, and other publics on their roles in new technologies. This article reviews the early history of the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the United States, and it further explicates anticipatory governance through exploring the genealogy of the term and addressing a set of critiques found in the literature. These critiques involve skepticism of three proximities of anticipatory governance: to its object, nanotechnology, which is a relatively indistinct one; to the public, which remains almost utterly naïve toward nanotechnology; and to technoscience itself, which allegedly renders anticipatory governance complicit in its hubris. The article concludes that the changing venues and the amplification within them of the still, small voices of folks previously excluded from offering constructive visions of futures afforded by anticipatory governance may not be complete solutions to our woes in governing technology, but they certainly can contribute to bending the long arc of technoscience more toward humane ends. © The Author(s) 2013.","anticipatory governance; emerging technologies; foresight; nanotechnology; public engagement; responsible innovation","article; government regulation; legal aspect; nanotechnology; nomenclature; United States; Government Regulation; Nanotechnology; Terminology as Topic; United States",,,,,"Adams, V., Murphy, M., Clarke, A.E., Anticipation: Technoscience, life, affect, temporality (2009) Subjectivity, 28, pp. 246-265; Allhoff, F., Lin, P., Moor, J., Weckert, J., (2007) Nanoethics: The Ethical and Social Implications of Nanotechnology, , Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Al-Qasimi, N., (2011) Anticipatory governance, queer difference, and the Emirati post-oil generation, , Presentation at the UCLA Center for Near Eastern Studies; Los Angeles, CA; Arora, S.K., Porter, A.L., Youtie, J., Shapira, P., Capturing new developments in an emerging technology: An updated search strategy for identifying nanotechnology research outputs (2013) Scientometrics, 95, pp. 351-370; Bächler, G., Conflict transformation through state reform (2001) Berghof Handbook for Conflict Transformation, , http://www.berghof-handbook.net/documents/publications/baechler_handbook.pdf, Available at, (accessed 16 September 2013); Barben, D., Fisher, E., Selin, C., Guston, D.H., (2008) The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies, pp. 979-1000. , Hackett EJAmsterdamska OLynch MWajcman J, ed.;, Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Bell, L., Engaging the public in public policy: How far should museums go?

When there are foreign financial disturbances and the amount of foreign exchange reserves reaches the threshold, the government contracts the domestic credit so as to prevent an additional decrease in foreign reserves. The results show that the relative scale of the threshold for foreign reserves influences the timing of the regime collapse, the extent of domestic credit contraction and the dynamic adjustment of the economy. © 2014 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","dynamic adjustment; foreign financial disturbances; regime collapse",,,,,,"Agenor, P.R., Bhandari, J.S., Flood, R.P., Speculative Attacks and Models of Balance-of-Payments Crises (1992) Staff Papers - International Monetary Fund, 39, pp. 357-394; Bhandari, J.S., (1982) Exchange Rate Determination and Adjustment, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Preager Publishers; Bhandari, J.S., An Alternative Theory of Exchange Rate Dynamics (1983) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 98, pp. 337-348; Blackburn, K., Collapsing Exchange Rate Regimes and Exchange Rate Dynamics: Some Further Examples (1988) Journal of International Money and Finance, 7, pp. 373-385; Blanchard, O.J., Output, the Stock Market, and Interest Rates (1981) American Economic Review, 71, pp. 132-143; Calvo, G.A., Reinhart, C.M., Fear of Floating (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (2), pp. 379-408; Chang, W.Y., Lai, C.C., Collapsing Dual Floating Exchange Rate Regimes (1990) Academia Economic Papers, 18 (1), pp. 37-82; Chow, G.C., Shen, Y., Money, Price Level and Output in the Chinese Macro Economy (2005) Asia-Pacific Journal of Accounting & Economics, 12, pp. 91-111; Chu, M.L., Tsaur, T.W., The Dynamic Adjustment of Output, Stock Market and Exchange Rate (1987) Academia Economic Papers, 15 (2), pp. 45-59; Coulibaly, B., Sapriza, H., Zlate, A., Financial Frictions, Trade Credit, and the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis (2013) International Review of Economics & Finance, 26, pp. 25-38; Djajić, S., Dynamics of the Exchange Rate in Anticipation of Pegging (1989) Journal of International Money and Finance, 8, pp. 559-571; Dornbusch, R., Expectations and Exchange Rate Dynamics (1976) Journal of Political Economy, 84, pp. 1161-1176; Driskill, R., Exchange Rate Overshooting, the Trade Balance, and Rational Expectations (1981) Journal of International Economics, 11, pp. 361-377; Flood, R.P., Garber, P.M., Collapsing Exchange-rate Regimes (1984) Journal of International Economics, 17, pp. 1-13; Gavin, M., The Stock Market and Exchange Rate Dynamics (1989) Journal of International Money and Finance, 8, pp. 181-200; Hu, S.W., Chang Liao, P.S., Wang, V., Regulation of the Agricultural Product Stock and Regime Collapse (2006) Journal of Social Sciences and Philosophy, 18 (4), pp. 565-598; Hu, S.W., Hung, L.H., Wang, V., Agricultural Market Disturbances and the Dynamic Adjustment of the Commodity Prices: Application of Regime Collapse (2005) Taiwanese Agricultural Economic Review, 10 (2), pp. 199-235; Keister, T., Expectations and Contagion in Self-fulfilling Currency Attacks (2009) International Economic Review, 50, pp. 991-1012; Krugman, P., A Model of Balance-of-payments Crises (1979) Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, 11, pp. 311-325; Lai, C.C., The Development of International Finance Theories: A Survey (2005) Journal of Economics and Management, 1, pp. 105-118; Lai, C.C., Hsieh, Y.N., Chang, W.Y., Arbitrage under Dual Floating Exchange Rate and Regime Collapse (1996) Taiwan Economic Review, 24 (1), pp. 61-93; Morales, L., Andreosso-O'Callaghan, B., The Global Financial Crisis: World Market or Regional Contagion Effects?

The idea of succession planning needs to be included in the long-range plan. Strategic planning grows from a strong mission and vision and, in this case, implementing succession planning as a value. By employing some foresight in the development of policy, an environment supporting succession planning is created. Becoming part of the process and gaining a support network with resources are important aspects of this discussion. Assessment of the current situation and considering the structure of the library also come into play. Creating a strategic plan that involves succession planning is the goal. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Ammons-Stephens, S., Cole, H.J., Developing core leadership competences for the library profession (2009) Library Leadership and Management, 23 (2), pp. 63-74;

The first three core leadership points are strongly based on the theoretical model of Phipps (2012). The first core subject is a leader's personal spiritual beliefs, schema, or worldview. The existential worldview, as categorized by Koltko-Rivera (2004), shares the Christian worldview as a prototypical basis for servant leadership. The second core subject is a leader's constructive development or life experience, which shapes a leader's thinking (Phipps, 2012). This entails how a leader learns, processes, and makes meaning by reflecting on the school of personal experience, including trials and crucibles. The third core subject is more of a leader outcome, called meta-belief. A servant leader utilizes meta-belief or self-awareness in order to make choices in particular places and contexts. Finally, the fourth core essential subject that is evident to followers of servant leaders is vision and hope. A hopeful leader is always optimistically looking ahead with foresight, knowing what has taken place in both the past and present. © 2014, IGI Global.

Clinical experience suggests that such impulsive behavior can impact on the fall risk in Parkinson's disease (PD), but this has never been tested. We investigated whether trait impulsivity is related to fall risk in a large cohort of PD patients. We also investigated whether trait impulsivity affects the fall risk differently for patients with more or less postural instability and gait disability (PIGD). Methods: 388 patients with PD (H&Y≤3) completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11, higher scores indicating greater impulsivity) to assess trait impulsivity, including three subscales: motor impulsivity (e.g. ""I do things without thinking""), attentional impulsivity (e.g. ""I concentrate easily"") and non-planning (e.g. ""I plan tasks carefully""). Falls were registered prospectively for 6 months. Patients classified as non-fallers (0 falls, n = 237) were compared to recurrent PD fallers (>1 fall, n = 78). Results: Total impulsivity scores were higher for recurrent fallers (59.5) compared to non-fallers (56.8; p = .012). This effect was predominantly driven by higher scores on the subscale for attentional impulsivity (p = .003). The difference in attentional impulsivity was independent of gender, disease severity, dopaminergic medication, and cognitive function. Motor and non-planning impulsivity did not differ between recurrent fallers and non-fallers. There was no evidence that impulsivity modulated the association between PIGD and fall risk. Discussion: This is the first evidence that impulsivity, in particular in the attentional domain, is related to fall risk in PD. © 2014 Smulders et al.",,"abnormal posture; aged; article; Barratt Impulsiveness Scale; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; disease association; disease severity; fall risk; female; gait disorder; human; impulsiveness; major clinical study; male; Parkinson disease; patient coding; prediction; risk assessment; self report; body posture; cognition; demography; falling; metabolism; multivariate analysis; neurologic gait disorder; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; regression analysis; statistical model; dopamine; Accidental Falls; Aged; Cognition; Demography; Dopamine; Female; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Logistic Models; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Parkinson Disease; Posture; Regression Analysis; Self Report",,"dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; Dopamine",,,"Pickering, R.M., Grimbergen, Y.A.M., Rigney, U., Ashburn, A., Mazibrada, G., Wood, B., Gray, P., Bloem, B.R., A meta-analysis of six prospective studies of falling in Parkinson's disease (2007) Movement Disorders, 22 (13), pp. 1892-1900. , DOI 10.1002/mds.21598; Bloem, B.R., Bhatia, K.P., Gait and balance in basal ganglia disorders (2004) Clinical Disorders of Balance, Posture and Gait, pp. 173-206. , Bronstein AM, Brandt T, Nutt JG, Woollacott MH, editors London: Arnold; Ahlskog, J.E., Think before you leap Donepezil reduces falls?

The built environment is considered as a set of different capitals (natural, physical, economic, social and cultural) with limited possibilities for substitution between the capitals. Resilience is related to other concepts used in the search for a sustainable development of the built environment: continuity, stability and equilibrium, duration and durability, robustness and vulnerability, fast- and slow-moving risks. Cultural capital (in its material and intangible forms) as well as natural capital are significant due to long foresight considerations, high uncertainty and limitations on substitutions. Different time and scale categories and the conservation of different capitals need different anticipation and resilience strategies. It is argued that natural and cultural capitals can be transmitted if they are conservatively used and if adaptation occurs slowly. Specific strategies are needed for the non-recoverability of cultural capital. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","adaptation; built environment; continuity; cultural capital; durability; resilience; social-ecological system; sustainability; temporal perspectives","adaptation; Built environment; continuity; cultural capital; resilience; Social-ecological systems; temporal perspectives; Durability; Sustainable development",,,,,"Assmann, A., Zeit und Tradition (1999) Kulturelle Strategien der Dauer Koin; Assmann, J., (1999) Das Kulturelle Gedä Chtnis, Schrift, Erinnerung und Politische Identitä T in Frü Hen Hochkulturen; Assmann, J., (2010) Cultural Memory and Early Civilization: Writing, Remembrance, and Political Imagination, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards A New Modernity, , Munich: Sage; Berkes, F., Folke, C., Investing in cultural capital for sustainable use of natural capital (1994) Investing in Natural Capital Stockholm: Beijer International Institute, pp. 128-149; Bradley, P., Kohler, N., Methodology for the survival analysis of urban building stocks (2007) Building Research &Information, 35 (5), pp. 529-542; Brand, F.S., Jax, K., Focusing the meaning(s) of resilience: Resilience as a descriptive concept and a boundary object (2007) Ecology and Society, 12 (1), p. 23. , http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol12/iss1/art23; Bublitz, H., (1999) Foucaults Archäologie des Kulturellen Unbewussten, , Zum Wissensarchiv und Wissensbegehren moderner Gesellschaften.

Results revealed that 7-year-olds outperformed 3-year-olds on the episodic foresight task that involved cool processes, but did not show age differences in performance on the task that involved hot processes. In fact, both 3- and 7-year-olds performed equally poorly on the task that required predicting a future physiological state that was in conflict with their current state. Further, performance on the two tasks was unrelated. We discuss the results in terms of differing developmental trajectories for episodic foresight tasks that differentially rely on hot and cool processes and the universal difficulties humans have with predicting later outcomes that conflict with current motivational states. © 2013 The British Psychological Society.",,"child; conflict; decision making; female; human; male; motivation; neuropsychological test; preschool child; thinking; Child; Child, Preschool; Conflict (Psychology); Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Motivation; Neuropsychological Tests; Thinking",,,,,"Atance, C.M., Future thinking in young children (2008) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17, pp. 295-298. , doi:10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00593.x; Atance, C.M., Jackson, L.K., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102, pp. 379-391. , doi:10.1016/j.jecp.2009.01.001; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361. , doi:10.1016/j.cogdev.2005.05.001; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., Preschoolers' current desires warp their choices for the future (2006) Psychological Science, 17, pp. 583-587. , doi:10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01748.x; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5, pp. 533-539. , doi:10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01804-0; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., The emergence of episodic future thinking in humans (2005) Learning and Motivation, 36, pp. 126-144. , doi:10.1016/j.lmot.2005.02.003; Bunch, K.M., Andrews, G., Development of relational processing in hot and cool tasks (2012) Developmental Neuropsychology, 37, pp. 134-152. , doi:10.1080/87565641.2011.632457; Busby, J., Suddendorf, T., Recalling yesterday and predicting tomorrow (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 362-372. , doi:10.1016/j.cogdev.2005.05.002; Carlson, S.M., Developmentally sensitive measures of executive function in preschool children (2005) Developmental Neuropsychology, 28, pp. 595-616. , doi:10.1207/s15326942dn2802_3; Carlson, S.M., Davis, A.C., Leach, J.G., Less is more: Executive function and symbolic representation in preschool children (2005) Psychological Science, 16, pp. 609-616. , doi:10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01583.x; Garon, N.M., Longard, J., Bryson, S.E., Moore, C., Making decisions about now and later: Development of future-oriented self-control (2012) Cognitive Development, 27, pp. 314-322. , doi:10.1016/j.cogdev.2012.05.003; Gilbert, D.T., Gill, M.J., Wilson, T.D., The future is now: Temporal correction in affective forecasting (2002) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 88, pp. 690-700. , doi:10.1006/obhd.2001.2982; Gogtay, N., Giedd, J.N., Lusk, L., Hayashi, K.M., Greenstein, D., Vaituzis, A.C., Thompson, P.M., Dynamic mapping of human cortical development during childhood through early adulthood (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 101, pp. 8174-8179. , doi:10.1073/pnas.0402680101; Hayne, H., Gross, J., McNamee, S., Fitzgibbon, O., Tustin, K., Episodic memory and episodic foresight in 3- and 5-year-old children (2011) Cognitive Development, 26, pp. 343-355. , doi:10.1016/j.cogdev.2011.09.006; Hongwanishkul, D., Happaney, K.R., Lee, W.S., Zelazo, P.D., Assessment of hot and cool executive function in young children: Age-related changes and individual differences (2005) Developmental Neuropsychology, 28, pp. 617-644. , doi:10.1207/s15326942dn2802_4; Hudson, J.A., Mayhew, E.M.Y., Children's temporal judgments for autobiographical past and future events (2011) Cognitive Development, 26, pp. 331-342. , doi:10.1016/j.cogdev.2011.09.005; Hudson, J.A., Mayhew, E.M., Prabhakar, J., The development of episodic foresight: Emerging concepts and methods (2011) Advances in Child Development and Behavior, 40, pp. 95-137. , doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-386491-8.00003-7; Hudson, J.A., Shapiro, L.R., Sosa, B.B., Planning in the real world: Preschool children's scripts and plans for familiar events (1995) Child Development, 66, pp. 984-998. , doi:10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00917.x; Lagattuta, K.H., Sayfan, L., Developmental changes in children's understanding of future likelihood and uncertainty (2011) Cognitive Development, 26, pp. 315-330. , doi:10.1016/j.cogdev.2011.09.004; Loewenstein, G., Schkade, D., Wouldn't it be nice?

This study explores the use of oil-in-water MNP emulsions to achieve mixing in a nonmagnetic continuous phase tantamount to that occurring in equivalent dilute ferrofluid suspensions. To assess the technique, measurements of the torque exerted by ferrofluid emulsions and suspensions of equal magnetic content were performed in rotating, oscillating, and static magnetic fields. Results show that momentum transfer is fairly alike in amplitude and proportionality for the two types of systems of equal magnetic content under the three types of magnetic fields. This implies that momentum of spinning nanoparticles in the emulsions is transferable to the oil droplets containing them which, in return is then transferred to surrounding nonmagnetic liquid. The magnitude of the resulting mixing allows for the foresight of a versatile MNP mixing technology completely separated from the target phase being mixed. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Emulsion; Ferrofluid; Magnetic nanoparticle; Mixing; Process intensification; Torque measurement",,,,,,"McTague, J.P., Magnetoviscosity of magnetic colloids (1969) J Chem Phys., 51, pp. 133-136; Odenbach, S., (2002) Magnetoviscous Effects in Ferrofluids, , Berlin, Germany: Springer; Lu, A.H., Salabas, E.L., Schueth, F., Magnetic nanoparticles: synthesis, protection, functionalization, and application (2007) Angew Chem Int Ed., 46, pp. 1222-1244; Zhu, Y., Stubbs, L.P., Ho, F., Liu, R., Ship, C.P., Maguire, J.A., Hosmane, N.S., Magnetic nanocomposites: a new perspective in catalysis (2010) ChemCatChem., 2, pp. 365-374; Polshettiwar, V., Luque, R., Fihri, A., Zhu, H., Bouhrara, M., Bassett, J.M., Magnetically recoverable nanocatalysts (2011) Chem Rev., 111, pp. 3036-3075; Zeng, T., Yang, L., Hudson, R., Song, G., Moores, A.R., Li, C.J., Fe3O4 nanoparticle-supported copper(I) pybox catalyst: magnetically recoverable catalyst for enantioselective direct-addition of terminal alkynes to imines (2011) Org Lett., 13, pp. 442-445; Rosensweig, R.E., (1997) Ferrohydrodynamics, , Mineola, New York: Dover Publications; Odenbach, S., Gilly, H., Taylor vortex flow of magnetic fluids under the influence of an azimuthal magnetic field (1996) J Magn Magn Mater., 152, pp. 123-128; Odenbach, S., Stork, H., Shear dependence of field-induced contributions to the viscosity of magnetic fluids at low shear rates (1998) J Magn Magn Mater., 183, pp. 188-194; Rinaldi, C., Gutman, F., He, X.W., Rosenthal, A.D., Zahn, M., Torque measurements on ferrofluid cylinders in rotating magnetic fields (2005) J Magn Magn Mater., 289, pp. 307-310; Soto-Aquino, D., Rinaldi, C., Transient magnetoviscosity of dilute ferrofluids (2011) J Magn Magn Mater., 323, pp. 1319-1323; Hajiani, P., Larachi, F., Reducing Taylor dispersion in capillary laminar flows using magnetically excited nanoparticles: nanomixing mechanism for micro/nanoscale applications (2012) Chem Eng J., 203, pp. 492-498; Hajiani, P., Larachi, F., Controlling lateral nanomixing and velocity profile of dilute ferrofluid capillary flows in uniform stationary, oscillating and rotating magnetic fields (2013) Chem Eng J., 223, pp. 454-466; Bibette, J., Monodisperse ferrofluid emulsions (1993) J Magn Magn Mater., 122, pp. 37-41; Montagne, F., Mondain-Monval, O., Pichot, C., Mozzanega, H., Elaissari, A., Preparation and characterization of narrow sized (o/w) magnetic emulsion (2002) J Magn Magn Mater., 250, pp. 302-312; Becher, P., (1965) Emulsions: Theory and Practice, , New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation; Aronson, M.P., The role of free surfactant in destabilizing oil-in-water emulsions (1989) Langmuir., 5, pp. 494-501; Bibette, J., Roux, D., Nallet, F., Depletion interactions and fluid-solid equilibrium in emulsions (1990) Phys Rev Lett., 65, pp. 2470-2473; Bibette, J., Depletion interactions and fractionated crystallization for polydisperse emulsion purification (1991) J Colloid Interface Sci., 147, pp. 474-478; Chantrell, R.W., Popplewell, J., Charles, S.W., Measurements of particle-size distribution parameters in ferrofluids (1978) IEEE Trans Magn., 14, pp. 975-977","Faïçal, L.; Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Laval University, 1065, Avenue de la Médecine, QC, Quebec G1V 0A6, Canada; email: faical.larachi@gch.ulaval.ca",,,,,,,,00011541,,AICEA,,"English","AIChE J.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894043592

This article analyzes an action research process implemented in the Chaouia coastal region of Morocco, where weak governance of the social-ecological system led to a groundwater and agricultural crisis. A dialogue between local actors was set up with the aim of identifying strategies to address the crisis. First separately and then together, farmers' groups and staff members of public organizations analyzed the existing situation, scenarios for the future of the area, and strategies to cope with the crisis. Contrary to the expectations of the participants, farmers and staff members of public organizations had productive discussions. This approach clarified how social learning can be achieved and governance improved in this situation of weak governance. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","foresight analysis; groundwater; Morocco; social learning; weak governance","crisis management; governance approach; groundwater; learning; organizational framework; stakeholder; strategic approach; water management; water resource; Morocco",,,,,"Armstrong, P., Human rights and multilateral development banks: Governance concerns in decision making (1994) Proc.

To address this issue, the objective of this article is to map the range of the possible future diet changes and to explore their impact on agriculture using the Nexus Land-Use model. This model computes agricultural intensification in the crop and livestock sectors at the global scale, based on an architecture accounting for the different types of food calories. By considering four scenarios built on distinct assumptions regarding diet convergence, this article sheds light on the pivotal role of diet changes as drivers of tensions on agriculture and land use and shows the uncertainty associated with processes of diet convergence for foresight exercises on food and agriculture. Finally, the interactions between food production and the other land-use patterns are explored by testing the sensitivity of our results to assumptions regarding biofuel production, deforestation, potential crop yields, and nutrient-use efficiency. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","globalization; land-use change; shift in diets",,,,,,"Alexandratos, N., Bruinsma, J., (2012) World agriculture towards 2030/2050: The 2012 revision, , (Technical Report, ESA Working Paper No. 12-03).

The analysis through this methodology is directed at decision makers and stakeholders as they evaluate the role of minerals in the Afghan economy and intends to inform public policies regarding mineral extraction beyond sectoral silo focus. The future space is visualized through the six pillars approach with accompanying methods and by identifying patterns of change. There is a valid risk of greatly over-estimating the economic and strategic opportunities offered by Afghanistan's newly discovered mineral wealth. Afghanistan also risks being infected with the resource curse.

However, substantially less research is devoted to the study of specific aptitudes in spite of their importance to educational, occupational, and avocational success. We sought to determine subcortical brain structural correlates of several broad aptitudes including Math, Vocabulary, Foresight, Paper Folding, and Inductive Reasoning in a large (N = 107), healthy, young (age range = 16-29) cohort. Subcortical volumes were measured using an automated technique (FreeSurfer) across structures including bilateral caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, amygdala, and five equal regions of the corpus callosum. We found that performance on measures of each aptitude was predicted by different subcortical structures: Math - higher right nucleus accumbens volume; Vocabulary - higher left hippocampus volume; Paper Folding - higher right thalamus volume; Foresight - lower right thalamus and higher mid anterior corpus callosum volume; Inductive Reasoning - higher mid anterior corpus callosum volume. Our results support general findings, within the cognitive neurosciences, showing lateralization of structure-function relationships, as well as more specific relationships between individual structures (e.g., left hippocampus) and functions relevant to particular aptitudes (e.g., Vocabulary). © 2014 Jung et al.",,"adolescent; adult; amygdaloid nucleus; aptitude; aptitude test; article; caudate nucleus; corpus callosum; female; globus pallidus; hippocampus; human; human experiment; image processing; male; normal human; nucleus accumbens; putamen; subcortex; thalamus; aptitude; brain; brain mapping; individuality; physiology; procedures; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aptitude; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Young Adult",,,,,"Jung, R.E., Haier, R.J., The Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT) of intelligence: Converging neuroimaging evidence (2007) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 30, p. 135; Dietrich, A., Kanso, R., A Review of EEG, ERP, and Neuroimaging Studies of Creativity and Insight (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 822-848; DeYoung, C.G., Hirsh, J.B., Shane, M.S., Papademetris, X., Rajeevan, N., Testing predictions from personality neuroscience.

The main focus is on changing consumption patterns and the consequences for food security and for the pressure on natural resources. In this context, the question is raised as to how foresight work can reflect the mechanisms by which a transition towards more sustainable consumption can influence the sustainability of the production systems. The authors first analyze the main drivers of the past and future evolution of food systems and then the implications for foresight analysis. An attempt is made to identify specific issues and policies that should be further analyzed. In particular, future foresight will be challenged to incorporate the interactions between consumption and production more explicitly and to address four issues: (i) intra-national heterogeneity of diets and resulting nutritional outcomes, (ii) externalities resulting from the process of production, processing, and marketing along the product chain, (iii) competition between food and non-food uses of agricultural commodities and between agricultural and non-agricultural use of land and (iv) mechanisms by which food scarcity causes hunger and malnutrition. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Consumption production linkages; Food security; Foresight; Perspectives for sustainable food consumption; Sustainable agricultural production",,,,,,"Alexandratos, N., Bruinsma, J., (2012) World agriculture towards 2030/2050: The 2012 revision.

However, such analyses involve many challenges, particularly because the actors concerned may not consider climate change to be an urgent concern. This paper examines the methodological choices made by three research teams in the design and implementation of participatory foresight analyses to explore agricultural and water management options for adaptation to climate change. Case studies were conducted in coastal areas of France, Morocco, and Portugal where the groundwater is intensively used for irrigation, the aquifers are at risk or are currently overexploited, and a serious agricultural crisis is underway. When designing the participatory processes, the researchers had to address four main issues: whether to avoid or prepare dialogue between actors whose relations may be limited or tense; how to select participants and get them involved; how to facilitate discussion of issues that the actors may not initially consider to be of great concern; and finally, how to design and use scenarios. In each case, most of the invited actors responded and met to discuss and evaluate a series of scenarios. Strategies were discussed at different levels, from farming practices to aquifer management. It was shown that such participatory analyses can be implemented in situations which may initially appear to be unfavourable. This was made possible by the flexibility in the methodological choices, in particular the possibility of framing the climate change issue in a broader agenda for discussion with the actors. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change adaptation; Foresight analysis; Groundwater; Participatory processes",,,,,,"Arnell, N.W., Climate change and global water resources: SRES emissions and socio-economic scenarios (2004) Glob Environ Chang, 14, pp. 31-52; Bento, S., Varanda, M., Dionnet, M., Correia, L., Gervasi, C., Rovisco, E., Pescada, S., Schmidt, L., Does climate change entail social change?

The minimum score for the leadership or technical categories is eight, the maximum score 32. The 20/20 survey methodology was applied to two different companies. The survey respondents were a combination of people from sales, engineering, administration and management. The data shows the 20/20 survey can be a useful tool for coming up with a baseline and identifying areas for organizational improvement.

We recently proposed that the new anthropoid areas reduce foraging errors by generating goals from current contexts and learning to do so rapidly, sometimes based on single events. Among the contexts used to generate these goals, the posterior parietal cortex provides the new prefrontal areas with information about relational metrics such as order, number, duration, length, distance and proportion, which play a crucial role in foraging choices. Here we propose that this specialized network later became adapted to support the human capacity for reasoning and general problem-solving. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Posterior parietal cortices; Single event; Specialized networks; Biology; Cognitive systems; Mammals; brain nerve cell; chimpanzee; comparative anatomy; ecology; foraging; human; neuroanatomy; neurobiology; neuroimaging; neurophysiology; nonhuman; posterior parietal cortex; prefrontal cortex; problem solving; review; simian; Animals; Appetitive Behavior; Biological Evolution; Humans; Neural Pathways; Parietal Lobe; Prefrontal Cortex; Primates; Problem Solving",,,,,"Leathers, M.L., Olson, C.R., In monkeys making value-based decisions, LIP neurons encode cue salience and not action value (2012) Science, 338, pp. 132-135; Gottlieb, J., Simultaneous representation of saccade targets and visual onsets in monkey lateral intraparietal area (2005) Cereb.

Subjective discount rates present one possible explanation for this lack of foresight, but little is known about their level and reliability in the general population. With regard to behavior, persons with lower discount rates are expected to accept additional costs upfront more readily than those with higher discount rates. Based on a representative nation-wide study, the Swiss Environmental Survey 2007, and a follow-up survey, our analyses reveal that on average subjective discount rates are well above market interest rates and moderately stable over a time interval of four years. Income and education are negatively correlated with discount rates.

In order to project different alternative futures of health care for people with dementia (PwD) in Germany, we have initiated a multidisciplinary scenario process (Sce-Dem). Methods: For the scenario process we used a 6-step approach: (1) identification of relevant areas of influences via literature review and internet search, (2) systematic collection of relevant influence factors and their future projections via literature review, brainstorming and consensus workshops, (3) discussion and validation of the identified key factors in a workshop with 52 multidisciplinary, experts, to clarify their characteristics and future projections, (4) combining the relevant key factors with alternative projections in a so-called consistency matrix to estimate the consistency between the selected projections, (5) generating consistent combinations of projections using software, and (6) writing scenario stories and descriptions based on the most consistent and different combinations. Results: As a result of the scenario process, five consistent scenarios were developed. Two of these could be described as dark scenarios with very poor prospects. A third one has been referred to as ""well-meant, but badly done"". Two scenarios entail mostly positive aspects but one of them has a tendency towards, a ""health control"" state. Conclusion: The more positive scenarios provide a framework for determining relevant actions in research, society, and politics. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Alzheimer's disease; Dementia; Foresight; Health services research; Scenario approach","article; brainstorming; consensus; dementia; health care; health care cost; health care delivery; health care policy; human; risk assessment; social support; dementia; Germany; health care planning; health care policy; health care quality; health service; standards; Delivery of Health Care; Dementia; Germany; Health Planning; Health Policy; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Quality of Health Care",,,,,"Sloane, P.D., Zimmerman, S., Suchindran, C., Reed, P., Wang, L., Boustani, M., The public health impact of Alzheimer's disease, 2000-2050: potential implication of treatment advances (2002) Annual Review of Public Health, 23, pp. 213-231; Ferri, C.P., Prince, M., Brayne, C., Brodaty, H., Fratiglioni, L., Ganguli, M., Global prevalence of dementia: a Delphi consensus study (2005) Lancet, 366, pp. 2112-2117; (2010) Demografischer Wandel in Deutschland.

The data set was obtained in August-September 2011, November 2011, and April-May 2012, covering the dry season, short rain season and long rain season respectively. Release of (largely untreated) wastewater from the city of Nairobi had a profound impact on the biogeochemistry of the upper Athi River, leading to low dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation levels (36-67%), high ammonium (NH4+) concentrations (123-1193 μmol L&minus;1), and high dissolved methane (CH4) concentrations (3765-6729 nmol L&minus;1). Riverine dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; sum of NH4+ and nitrate (NO3&minus;); nitrite was not measured) concentration at the most upstream site on the Athi River was highest during the dry season (1195 μmol L&minus;1), while DIN concentration was an order of magnitude lower during the short and long rain seasons (212 and 193 μmol L-1, respectively). During the rain seasons, low water residence time led to relatively minimal in-stream N cycling prior to discharge to the ocean, whereas during the dry season we speculate that prolonged residence time creates two differences comparative to wet season, where (1) intense N cycling and removal of DIN is possible in the upper to mid-catchment and leads to significantly lower concentrations at the outlet during the dry season, and (2) as a result this leads to the progressive enrichment of 15N in the particulate N (PN) pool, highlighting the dominance of untreated wastewater as the prevailing source of riverine DIN. The rapid removal of NH4+ in the upper reaches during the dry season was accompanied by a quantitatively similar production of NO3&minus; and nitrous oxide (N2O) downstream, pointing towards strong nitrification over this reach during the dry season. Nitrous oxide produced was rapidly degassed downstream, while the elevated NO3&minus; concentrations steadily decreased to levels observed elsewhere in more pristine African river networks. Low pelagic primary production rates over the same reach suggest that benthic denitrification was the dominant process controlling the removal of NO3&minus;, although large cyanobacterial blooms further downstream highlight the significant role of DIN assimilation by primary producers also. Consequently, the intense nitrification and uptake of N by algae leads to significant enrichment of 15N in the PN pool during the dry season (mean: +16.5 ± 8.2&permil; but reaching as high as +31.5&permil;) compared to the short (+7.3 ± 2.6&permil;) and long (+7.6 ± 5.9&permil;) rain seasons. A strong correlation between the seasonal N stable isotope ratios of PN (δ15NPN) and oxygen stable isotope ratios of river water (δ18OH2O; as a proxy of freshwater discharge) presents the possibility of employing a combination of proxies - such as δ15NPN of sediments, bivalves and near-shore corals - to reconstruct how historical land use changes have influenced nitrogen cycling within the catchment, whilst potentially providing foresight on the impacts of future land management decisions. © Author(s) 2014.",,"anthropogenic effect; biogeochemistry; biomass; catchment; concentration (composition); cyanobacterium; denitrification; dissolved oxygen; land management; land use change; methane; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen cycle; river water; saturation; seasonal variation; transformation; Athi Basin; Eastern Province [Kenya]; Galana Basin; Kenya",,,,,"Abril, G., Frankignoulle, M., Nitrogen-alkalinity interactions in the highly polluted Scheldt basin (Belgium) (2001) Water Res., 35, pp. 844-850; Aravena, R., Evans, M.L., Cherry, J.A., Stable isotopes of oxygen and nitrogen in source identification of nitrate from septic systems (1993) Ground Water, 31 (2), pp. 180-186; Ayres, R.U., Schlesinger, W.H., Socolow, R.H., (1994) Human Impacts on the Nitrogen Cycle In: Industrial Ecology and Global Change, pp. 121-155. , edited by: Socolow R., Andrews C., Berkhout F., Thomas V., Cambridge University Press Cambridge United Kingdom; Bartlett, K.B., Crill, P.M., Bonassi, J.A., Richey, J.E., Harris, R.C., Methane flux from the Amazon River floodplain: Emissions during rising water (1990) J.

Lyngby, Denmark","The practice and concept of foresight have developed over several decades. However, the academic literature that addresses foresight is mainly descriptive, and it is generally acknowledged that there is a gap between practice and theory in foresight. This article contributes to building the theoretical underpinnings of foresight. The article explores the co-evolution of the academic field of innovation studies and the practice and concept of foresight. The article illustrates that foresight is importing the dominant understanding of innovation from innovation studies with a time lag. Currently, foresight is in a catching-up process vis-à-vis innovation studies by gradually incorporating the implications of a systemic understanding of innovation. The latter is reflected in the current research gaps in foresight. This paper concludes that the concept of innovation system foresight (ISF) constitutes an improved integration of the contemporary understanding of innovation into foresight. Furthermore, the article explores four preliminary implications of ISF on the conceptual design of foresight, including the goal of foresight, system definition and boundary setting, participation of actors, and finally, methods for mapping the present. These four implications also constitute avenues for further research. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Conceptual review; Foresight; Innovation systems; Systemic approach; Theoretical underpinnings","Conceptual design; Academic fields; Academic literature; Conceptual review; Foresight; Innovation studies; Innovation system; Research gaps; Systemic approach; Underpinnings; academic research; conceptual framework; future prospect; innovation; research work; theoretical study; technological change; technological development",,,,,"Alkemade, F., Kleinschmidt, C., Hekkert, M., Analysing emerging innovation systems: a functions approach to foresight (2007) Int.

Aligned with the coordination of societal actors, foresight processes of that kind aim to better enable innovation systems to address common challenges. In doing so, foresight activities become more relevant and have greater impacts in decision-making processes. The analysis of the evolution of Foresight in Brazil presented in this paper shows a greater role of such studies in formulating science, technology and innovation policy.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a detailed literature review devoted to an evaluation of foresight and traditional projects. The approaches to project evaluation in the field of project management were investigated, and the main steps of traditional project evaluation process were determined. The most commonly applied steps of foresight evaluation were identified by the analysis of recent foresight evaluation projects. The comparison of evaluation frameworks for foresight projects and traditional projects allows to provide recommendations for foresight evaluation framework improvement. Findings: The paper identifies several lessons for foresight evaluation from project management. The elements which can enrich foresight evaluation framework are the following: the development of an evaluation model; the extensive use of quantitative methods; the elaboration of evaluation scales; the inclusion of economic indicators into evaluation; and the provision of more openness and transparency for evaluation results. Originality/value: Given the importance of foresight evaluation procedures and the lack of a commonly applied methodological approach, the value of this paper consists in identifying a foresight evaluation framework and enriching it with elements of project management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Evaluation; Foresight; Framework; Project management",,,,,,"Alsan, A., Öner, M.A., Comparison of national foresight studies by integrated foresight management model (2004) Futures, 36 (8), pp. 889-902; Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 539-557; Bezold, C., Lessons from using scenarios for strategic foresight (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1513-1518; Bohanec, M., Rajkovič, V., Semolič, B., Pogačnik, A., Knowledge-based portfolio analysis for project evaluation (1995) Information & Management, 28 (5), pp. 293-302; Bower, D.C., Finegan, A.D., New approaches in project performance evaluation technique (2009) International Journal of Managing Projects in Business, 2 (3), pp. 435-444; Calof, J., (2011) Evaluating future technology assessment - Canadian case study, , http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC64647.pdf, paper presented at the 4th International Seville Conference on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis (FTA), 12-13 May, Seville, Spain, available at; Calof, J., Smith, J.E., (2008), Critical success factors for government led foresight, paper presented at the Third International Seville Seminar on Future Oriented Technology Analysis: Impacts and implications for policy and decision-making, 16-17 October, Seville, Spain; (2010) Evaluation toolkit: A guide for environmental NGOs, , www.cleanairpartnership.org/building_evaluation_capacity_private, (CAP), available at, Partnership Clean Air; Coates, J., Foresight in Federal Government Policymaking (1985) Futures Research Quarterly, 1, pp. 29-53; Crown, (2009) Multi-Criteria Analysis: A Manual, , www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/1132618.pdf, available at:, Crown, London; Cuhls, K., Georghiou, L., Evaluating a participative foresight process: 'Futur - the German research dialogue' (2004) Research Evaluation, 13 (3), pp. 143-153; Daim, T., Basoglu, N., Dursun, O., Saritas, O., Pisek, G., A comprehensive review of Turkish technology foresight project (2009) Foresight, 11 (1), pp. 21-42; Destatte, P., (2007), Evaluation of foresight: how to take long term impacts into consideration?

Foresight could potentially greatly benefit from resources that become available when the knowledge base increases through networks. This article seeks to investigate how innovation networks and foresight are related, to what extent networked foresight activities exist and how they are practiced. For the former the Cyclic Innovation Model (CIM) is utilized as analytical framework and applied to three cases. The foresight activities are analyzed in terms of type, scope and role. The cases are a collaboration between government agencies and a research organization and two inter-organizational networks of different size. 'Networked foresight' is clearly observable in all three cases. Indeed, a networked approach to foresight seems to strengthen the various roles of foresight. However, the rooting and openness of foresight activities in the three networks varies significantly. The advantages that 'networked foresight' entails could be exploited to a much higher degree for the networks themselves, e.g., the broad resource base and the large pool of people with diverse backgrounds that are available. Furthermore, effective instruments for the re-integration of knowledge into the networks' partner organizations are needed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Foresight; Futures research; Innovation networks; Networked foresight; Open innovation","future prospect; governance approach; innovation; integrated approach; knowledge; model test; research work",,,,,"Cooper, R., Project NewProd: factors in new product success (1980) European Journal of Marketing, 14, pp. 277-292; Tidd, J., (2005) Managing Innovation Integrating Technological, Market and Organization Change, Hoboken; van der Duin, P., (2006) Qualitative Futures Research for Innovation, , Eburon Academic Publishers, Delft; Lichtenthaler, U., Ernst, H., External technology commercialization in large firms: results of a quantitative benchmarking study (2007) R&D Management, 37, pp. 383-397; Rohrbeck, R., Gemünden, H., Corporate foresight: its three roles in enhancing the innovation capacity of a firm (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78, pp. 231-243; Chesbrough, H., (2003) Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston; Dodgson, M., Gann, D., Salter, A., The role of technology in the shift towards open innovation: the case of Procter & Gamble (2006) R&D Management, 36, pp. 333-346; Rohrbeck, R., Hölzle, K., Gemünden, H.G., Opening up for competitive advantage - how Deutsche Telekom creates an open innovation ecosystem (2009) R&D Management, 39, pp. 420-430; Gassmann, O., Opening up the innovation process: towards an agenda (2006) R&D Management, 36, pp. 223-228; Edquist, C., (1997) Systems of Innovation - Technologies, , Institutions and Organizations, Routledge, Oxon; Rigby, D., Zook, C., Open-market innovation (2002) Harvard Business Review, 80, pp. 80-89; Gassmann, O., Enkel, E., Chesbrough, H., The future of open innovation (2010) R&D Management, 40, pp. 213-221; Liyanage, S., Towards a fourth generation R&D management model - research networks knowledge management (1999) International Journal of Technology Management, 18, pp. 372-393; Niosi, J., Fourth generation R&D (1999) Journal of Business Research, 45, pp. 100-117; Ortt, R.J., van der Duin, P., The evolution of innovation management towards contextual innovation (2008) European Journal of Innovation Management, 11, pp. 522-538; van der Duin, P., Ortt, R.J., Kok, M., The cyclic innovation model: a new challenge for a regional approach to innovation systems (2006) European Planning Studies, 15, pp. 195-215; von der Gracht, H.A., Vennemann, C.R., Darkow, I.L., Corporate foresight and innovation management: a portfolio-approach in evaluating organizational development (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 380-393; Phillips, F., On s-curves and tipping points (2007) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 74, pp. 715-730; Cuhls, K., Foresight with Delphi surveys in Japan (2001) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 13, pp. 555-569; Cuhls, K., (2008) Methoden der Technikvorausschau - eine international Übersicht, , Fraunhofer IRB Verlag, Karlsruhe; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes - new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22, pp. 93-111; Saffo, P., Six rules for effective forecasting (2007) Harvard Business Review, 85, pp. 122-131; Daheim, C., Uerz, G., Corporate foresight in Europe: ready for the next step?

The goal is to explore a set of concepts and link them to the effects they have in the world of foresight practice. It is argued that concepts order foresight practice and that though each foresight context and practitioner is unique, concepts bring a sense of order and coherence to foresight work and futures thinking. This reflection is placed in the context of a set of first principles the author acknowledges as his starting place for futures thinking and foresight practice. Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the form of conceptual analysis. Findings: Concepts have effects and these can be assessed based on their ability to increase social and personal resilience in contexts characterised by change, complexity and uncertainty. Research limitations/implications: Foresight practitioners clarify their own values and ethics through reflection on the concepts they use and the processes they deploy when working with clients. Practical implications: More reflective foresight practice; greater conceptual clarity when reflecting on and communicating/teaching foresight and futures thinking. Originality/value: This paper offers a basis for orienting foresight work towards the broader social goal of resilience through a deepened appreciation of how concepts inform process and structure meaning. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Anticipation; Concept; Culture; Futures; Pattern; Pragmatism",,,,,,"Adams, D., (1982) Life, the Universe and Everything, , Pan Macmillan, London; Brandom, R.B., (2008) Between Saying and Doing: Towards an Analytic Pragmatism, , Oxford University Press; Bussey, M., A world of exception: Exploring the thought of Loren Eiseley (2008) Death and Anti-Death: Thirty Years after Loren Eiseley (1907-1977), 5, pp. 165-196. , Tandy, C.

Until now, it has not been analyzed how this development affects the quality and structure of foresight processes. In this paper, a Delphi study is conducted to analyze the future path of ICT in foresight and to identify channels by which ICT drives progress in foresight and where there are limitations to this development. Using a real-time variant of the method, we posed 20 projections about ICT in 2020 to 177 foresight experts. In analyzing both quantitative and qualitative results of the study, we reveal that ICT will likely promote a shift in the focus of foresight exercises from scanning and data retrieval to more qualitative steps, such as interpretation, decision-making and implementation. In a growing foresight market, ICT should contribute to more efficient and accurate foresight processes with better accessibility to information, easy-to-use collaboration tools, data and knowledge linkages, quantitative modeling tools and process optimization. However, the qualitative nature of the discipline, value-driven challenges, as well as technological and competitive barriers should assure that foresight will remain a creative and human-centered activity with ICT tools only serving as supportive tools. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Data; Delphi method; Foresight; Foresight support systems; ICT","Communication systems; Decision making; Digital storage; Optimization; Tools; Data; Delphi method; Foresight; ICT; Support systems; Information technology; decision making; information and communication technology; optimization; quantitative analysis; real time; technological change; technological development",,,,,"Rohrbeck, R., (2010) Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg; Chermack, T.J., (2011) Scenario Planning in Organizations, , Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc., San Francisco, CA; Porter, A.L., Cunningham, S.W., (2005) Tech Mining: Exploiting New Technologies for Competitive Advantage, , John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, N.J; Gordon, T.J., Glenn, J.C., Jakil, A., Frontiers of futures research: what's next?

Open-ended interviews with key actors closely involved in foresight activities have been woven together to create richly descriptive narrative-a story-of the project and its context(s). This paper finds that the meaning of the New Zealand Foresight Project (NZFP) has yet to stabilize-the unevenness in understanding among the actors, noted only in passing in an earlier study of the NZFP, appears to be a defining rather than incidental feature of the project and its legacy. There is significant disagreement about the aims, objectives, and outcomes of the project, and whether the NZFP should, ultimately, be understood as a success or failure. This paper also identifies a number of shortcomings in the NZFP that might serve as lessons and/or warnings for future, large-scale foresight activities. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; History; New Zealand",,,,,,"Coen, J., Coen, E., (2008), (writers, producers & directors), Burn after reading (motion picture), United States, Focus Features; West, A., (2005), personal, communication, Aug 2; Christie, R., (2005), personal, communication, Aug 23; Yoda, T., Perceptions of domain experts on impact of foresight on policy making: The case of Japan (2011) Technol.

Design/methodology/approach - A methodology of interactive foresight process for creating regional future concepts is developed, which is based on a specific meaning of integral futures and uses online solutions, too. Findings - Personal meetings with small and medium enterprise (SME) stakeholders and the works of interactive communications with feedbacks within and among stakeholder groups was organized around the research homepage. The networking created the interconnection and the feedbacks between the stakeholders and the futurist group in the process of shaping regional future ideas. The online networking is running. Research limitations/implications - The low number of stakeholders can limit the validity and acceptance of futures ideas created by this process. Practical implications-The developed interactive foresight process can also be applicable at different organizational levels and in different fields for shaping shared future ideas. Social implications - Application of interactive foresight process can contribute to the development of anticipatory democracy. Originality/value - A theoretically based interactive foresight process has been developed in which stakeholders can participate not only interactively in the foresight process but they can implement the achievements in their enterprising activity as well. The participants were interested in foresight and cooperative during the whole process because they learned the use of foresight tools through collective solution of practical tasks which were important for them. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forecasting; Foresight; Knowledge creation; Regional development; Research methods; Scenario planning",,,,,,"Bezold, C., Anticipatory democracy revised (2008) Democracy and Futures, pp. 38-51. , in Mannermaa, M., Dator, J. and Tiihonen, P, Committee for Futures, Parliament of Finland; Buzan, T., (1996) The Mind Map Book, , Penguin Books, London; Chesbrough, H., (2003) Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; (2004) Innovation Strategy and Action Plan for the Central Hungarian Region, , A Közép-Magyarországi Régió Innovációs Stratégiája és Akcióterve, CHIC Közép-Magyarországi Innovációs Kht., Budaörs; Da Costa, O., Wamke, P., Scapolo, F., Cagnin, C., The impact of foresight on policy making: Insights from the FOR-LEARN mutual learning process (2008) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 20 (3), pp. 369-387; Daheim, C., Uerz, G., Corporate foresight in Europe: Ready for the next step?

This paper adds to these studies by investigating how theoretical elements of the innovation system approach can contribute to the design and practice of foresight processes. The paper originates in a foresight project in the Nordic facilities management sector. The goal of the foresight project was to identify the possible futures of the facilities management sector in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) and, based on the findings, to establish a proposal for a common Nordic facilities management research agenda. The paper finds that three elements of the innovation system literature are of particular interest for the practice of foresight: innovation systems and context dependency, learning and user-producer interactions, and the role of knowledge and knowledge production. These elements are embedded into a simple sectoral innovation system model (including actors, knowledge flows, and the strategic environment). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Facilities management; Foresight; Nordic; Priority setting of research; Sectoral innovation system","future prospect; industrial development; innovation; research and development; strategic approach; Denmark; Finland; Norway; Sweden",,,,,"Abadie, F., Friedewald, M., Weber, K.M., Adaptive foresight in the creative content industries: anticipating value chain transformations and need for policy action (2010) Science and Public Policy, 37 (1), pp. 19-30; Alkemade, F., Kleinschmidt, C., Hekkert, M., Analysing emerging innovation systems: a functions approach to foresight (2007) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 3 (2), pp. 139-168; Alsan, A., Öner, M.A., An integrated view of foresight: integrated foresight management model (2003) Foresight, 5 (2), pp. 33-45; Andersen, A.D., Andersen, P.D., Innovation System Foresight (2014) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, , (under review); Andersen, P.D., Jørgensen, B.H., Lading, L., Rasmussen, B., Sensor foresight-technology and market (2004) Technovation, 24 (4), pp. 311-320; Andersen, P.D., Rasmussen, B., (2012) Fremsyn: Metoder, praksis og erfaringer, , Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation, Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education; Andersen, P.D., Rasmussen, L.B., The impact of national traditions and cultures on national foresight processes (2014) Futures, 59, pp. 5-17; Andersen, P.D., Rasmussen, B., Strange, M., Haisler, J., Technology foresight on Danish nano-science and nano-technology (2005) Foresight, 7 (6), pp. 64-78; Arthur, W.B., Durlauf, S., Lane, D., Introduction (1997) The economy as an evolving complex system II, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, W.B.

Although policy-oriented foresight proves to be helpful and increasing for governments stimulate a forward-looking attitude, there is little reflection on how do futurists deal with policy in policy-oriented foresight. The text books state that future policy should not be included in the scenarios to allow policy-makers to “wind-tunnel“ future policies. Based upon ethnographic analysis in the Netherlands and on a review of internationally developed scenarios, we examine futurists' strategies and struggles with the policy-free ideal.","Ethnographic research; Foresight in action; Policy-free ideal; Policy-oriented foresight; Scenarios",,,,,,"Alcamo, J., Bouwman, L., Edmond, J., Gruebler, A., Morita, T., Sugandhy, J., An evaluation of the IPCC IS92 emission scenarios (1995) Climate Change 1994, pp. 233-304. , In IPCC (Eds.), Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Andersson, J., Futures studies for a new era -Experiences from the Swedish institute for futures studies (2010) Uitzicht, toekomst verkennen met beleid, pp. 251-257. , In van Asselt, Marjolein, B.

Motives behind the selection of foresight methods, the timing involved in using insights from foresight studies in strategic policy-making processes, the added value of foresight methods, and the barriers and leverage points experienced by policy-makers are described and compared at the local and the national level. Different insights are related to different activities in the policy cycle, i.e., agenda-setting, policy preparation, decision-making, implementation, and evaluation. In most evaluative studies on foresight, the added value is addressed from a 'supply-driven' point of view, by which we mean from the point of view of experts on the production or methodology of foresight studies. In this paper, the evaluation is approached from a demand-driven perspective, in other words, from a user perspective - i.e., that of policy-makers who have applied the results of foresight methods in policy-making processes. The insights presented in this paper are based on recent policy document analyses, in-depth interviews, and questionnaire research involving users in the local and national policy domain. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Dutch government; Foresight; Local; National; Policy; Scenarios; Users","decision making; government relations; policy analysis; policy implementation; policy making; Netherlands",,,,,"Hines, A., Bishop, B., (2006) Thinking About the Future.

The analysis is based on a Norwegian case of AR on regional foresight. The article reflects upon and develops the concept of action research (AR) as it relates to regional-foresight practices in connection with regional planning strategies (policies), according to Norway's new Planning and Building Act (PBA, 2008). Both AR and regional foresight are broad terms within a number of domains, and several contributions have sought to show how these are interlinked Ramos (2006). The focus is on how AR and action researchers both contribute to the co-creation of regional and sub-regional formulation of planning by regional-foresight processes, which are driven by decision-making regional bodies. This article contributes to the understanding of how an AR strategy of 'strategic facilitation' may improve the overall foresight capacity of all regional actors, both in concert and as single stakeholders. Also it furthers the understanding of how an AR approach may assist in transforming the foresight practices and the strategic decision-making into a more transparent process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Action research; Co-creation; Regional foresight; Regional strategy-making","action research; decision making; regional planning; regional policy; regional politics; Norway",,,,,"Ramos, J.M., Dimensions in the confluence of future studies and action research (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 642-655; Brown, L.D., Tandon, R., Action research, partnerships and social impacts: the institutional collaboration of PRIA and IDR (2008) The Sage Handbook of Action Research.

In this paper, the authors develop four principles for the design and management of global foresight exercises building on the experience of designing and managing the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) 2020 project. The first principle is understanding interconnected innovation systems. This principle ensures that participants position the foresight exercise and their own activities in a global context. The second principle is responsiveness towards diverse languages and cultures. This principle strengthens commitment and encourages learning and creative problem solving. The third principle is capacity to reconfigure international networks. This principle is about taking advantage of existing organisational structures and facilitates timely and efficient mobilisation of stakeholder communities. The fourth and last principle is '. glocal' impact orientation. This principle ensures that foresight activities are connected to both local and international decision-making structures. Overall, due to the heterogeneity of global projects, all four principles must also be implemented in keeping with a scalable design approach. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Innovation; International foresight; Roadmapping; Scenarios; Vision-building","decision making; innovation; language; manufacturing; stakeholder",,,,,"Boden, M., Cagnin, C., Carabias, V., Haegeman, K., Könnölä, T., (2010) Facing the future: time for the EU to meet global challenges, , Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg; Tang, L.Y., Shen, Q., Factors affecting effectiveness and efficiency of analysing stakeholders' needs and the briefing stage of public private partnership projects (2013) International Journal of Project Management, 31, pp. 513-521; Alsan, A., Oner, M.A., An integrated view of foresight: integrated foresight management model (2003) Foresight, 5 (2), pp. 33-45; Alsan, A., Oner, M.A., Comparison of national foresight studies by integrated foresight management model (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 889-902; Saritas, O., Oner, M.A., Systemic analysis of UK foresight results: joint application of integrated management model and roadmapping (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71, pp. 27-65; Saritas, O., (2006) Systems Thinking for Foresight, , (Ph.D. thesis), Manchester Institute of Innovation Research; TFAMWP (Technology Futures Analysis Methods Working Group) Technology futures analysis: Toward integration of the field and new methods (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71, pp. 287-303; Könnölä, T., Salo, A., Brummer, V., Foresight for European Coordination: Developing National Priorities for the Forest-Based Sector Technology Platform (2011) International Journal of Technology Management, 54 (4); Gertler, M.S., Wolfe, D.A., Local social knowledge management: Community actors, institutions and multilevel governance in regional foresight exercises (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 45-65; (2008) Future-Oriented Technology Analysis - Strategic Intelligence for an Innovative Economy, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, C.

Strategic foresight explores possible futures, their consequences for decisions, and the actions that promote more desirable futures. Foresight tools, such as horizon scanning and scenario planning, are increasingly used by governments and business for long-term strategic planning and capacity building. These tools are now being applied in ecology, although generally not as part of a comprehensive foresight strategy. We highlight several ways foresight could play a more significant role in environmental decisions by: monitoring existing problems, highlighting emerging threats, identifying promising new opportunities, testing the resilience of policies, and defining a research agenda. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Alternative futures; Causal layered analysis; Conservation; Conservation policy; Decision-making; Environmental futures; Futures research; Futures studies; Strategic thinking","biodiversity; conservation planning; decision making; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental policy; strategic environmental assessment; biodiversity; decision making; ecology; environment; environmental planning; environmental protection; forecasting; organization and management; trends; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Ecology; Environment; Environmental Policy; Forecasting; Planning Techniques",,,,,"Sutherland, W.J., Woodroof, H.J., The need for environmental horizon scanning (2009) Trends Ecol.

Mentally projecting ourselves backwards (i.e., episodic memory) or forwards (i.e., episodic foresight) in time are crucial characteristics of the human memory system. Indeed, over the past few years, episodic memory has been argued to be involved both in our capacity to retrieve our personal past experiences and in our ability to imagine and foresee future scenarios. However, recent theory and findings suggest that semantic memory also plays a significant role in imagining future scenarios. We draw on Tulving's definition of episodic and semantic memory to provide a critical analysis of their role in episodic foresight tasks described in the developmental literature. We conclude by suggesting future directions of research that could further our understanding of how both episodic memory and semantic memory are intimately connected to episodic foresight. © 2014 Martin-Ordas, Atance and Caza.","Children; Developmental psychology; Episodic foresight; Episodic memory; Semantic memory",,,,,,"Addis, D.R., Sacchetti, D.C., Ally, B.A., Budson, A.E., Schacter, D.L., Episodic simulation of future events is impaired in mild Alzheimer's disease (2009) Neuropsychologia, 47, pp. 2660-2671. , doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.05.018; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377. , doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.10.016; Atance, C.M., From the past into the future: the developmental origins and trajectory of episodic future thinking (2008) Handbook of Behavioral Neuroscience: Episodic Memory Research, pp. 99-114. , eds E.

The authors focus mainly on foresight studies undertaken in Europe. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a content analysis of public domain foresight studies. Findings: Foresight studies on the defence and security environment reflect a shift in security thinking away from a focus on state-centric threats towards a much broader view of security risks that includes risks presented by the vulnerability of European society to the failure of critical infrastructure, to pandemics, environmental change and resource based conflicts. The authors place a particular emphasis on the treatment of technological change in these defence and security foresight studies and argue that the growing importance of dual-use technologies is likely to mean that defence will play a declining role as a sponsor and lead-user of advanced technologies in the future. Originality/value: Foresight studies on the defence and security environment have grown in number since 9/11 not least in Europe. However, they have been the subject of little systematic analysis. This paper makes a contribution to such an analysis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Conflict; European Union; Innovation; Scenario planning; State security; Warfare",,,,,,"(2006) FinnSight 2015 - The Outlook for Science, Technology and Society, , Academy of Finland and Tekes, Helsinki Academy of Finland; Brown, S., Cornell, N.W., Fabian, L.L., Brown Weiss, E., (1977) Regimes for the Ocean, Outer Space and Weather, , The Brookings Institution, Washington, DC; Buzan, B., Waever, O., Wilde, J.D., (1998) Security: A New Framework for Analysis, , Lynne Rienner, Boulder, CO and London; (2008) Geostrategic prospectives for the next 30 years, , DAS, Report made under the direction of the Delegation aux affaires strategiques, Paris; (2007) The DCDC's Global Strategic Trends Programme 2007-2036, , DCDC (UK), Report prepared by the UK Ministry of Defence Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre, DCDC, Shrivenham; Edler, J., James, A.D., (2012) Understanding the emergence of STI policies in the EU: The genesis of EU security research and the role of the EU commission as policy entrepreneur, , MIoIR Working Paper Series no. 73, Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, Manchester; (2009) ESRIF Final Report, , ESRIF (European Security Research and Innovation Forum), European Security Research and Innovation Forum, Brussels; (2006) An Initial Long-Term Vision for European Defence Capabiliy and Capacity Needs, , European Defence Agency, EDA, Brussels; Falk, R., (1971) This Endangered Planet: Prospects and Proposals for Human Survival, , Random House, New York, NY; (2009) FORESEC: Cooperation in the Context of Complexity: European Security in Light of Evolving Trends, Drivers, and Threats, , FORESEC, FORESEC Final Report, European Commission DG Enterprise, Brussels; Giegerich, B., Pantucci, R., (2008) FORESEC Deliverable 2.4 Synthesis Report; Gnesotto, N., Grevi, G., (2006) The New Global Puzzle, , EU Institute for Security Studies, Paris; Hayes, B., (2006) Arming Big Brother: The EU's Security Research Programme, , TNI-Statewatch, Transnational Institute, Amsterdam; (2009) UK Science and Technology Strategy for Countering International Terrorism, , HM Government, (UK), Home Office, London; (2005) 2005-2055 Science and Technology Perspectives, , Institute for the Future, Institute for the Future for UK Government Office of Science & Innovation, London; James, A.D., Hartley, K., Lazaric, N., Gasparini, G., (2008) Study on How to Measure the Strengths and Weaknesses of the DTIB in Europe, , www.eda.europa.eu/documents/09-11-24/Study_on_how_to_measure_Strengths_and_Weaknesses_of_the_DTIB_in_Europe, available at, European Defence Agency, Brussels; Meadows, D.H., Meadows, D.I., Randers, J., Behrens, W.W., (1972) The Limits to Growth.

For each task, children encountered a problem in one room and, after a brief delay, were given the opportunity in a second room to select an item to solve the problem. Importantly, after selecting an item, children were queried about their memory for the problem. Age-related changes were found both in children's ability to select the correct item and their ability to remember the problem. However, when we controlled for children's memory for the problem, there were no longer significant age-related changes on the item choice measure. These findings suggest that age-related changes in children's performance on these tasks are driven by improvements in children's memory versus improvements in children's future-oriented thinking or ""foresight"" per se. Our results have important implications for how best to structure tasks to measure children's episodic foresight, and also for the relative role of memory in this task and in episodic foresight more broadly. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Cognitive development; Episodic foresight; Episodic memory; Future thinking; Memory","aging; anticipation; article; child; female; human; male; memory; physiology; preschool child; problem solving; psychological aspect; psychomotor performance; Aging; Anticipation, Psychological; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Problem Solving; Psychomotor Performance",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Pan, L., Vu, M., Laiser, N., Schacter, D.L., Constructive episodic simulation of the future and the past: Distinct subsystems of a core brain network mediate imagining and remembering (2009) Neuropsychologia, 47, pp. 2222-2238; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., The emergence of episodic future thinking in humans (2005) Learning and Motivation, 36, pp. 126-144; Brainerd, C.J., Reyna, V.F., Explaining ""memory free"" reasoning (1992) Psychological Science, 3, pp. 332-339; Brainerd, C.J., Reyna, V.F., Memory independence and memory interference in cognitive development (1993) Psychological Review, 100, pp. 42-67; Bryant, P.E., Trabasso, T., Transitive inferences and memory in young children (1971) Nature, 232, pp. 456-458; Busby, J., Suddendorf, T., Recalling yesterday and predicting tomorrow (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 362-372; Busby Grant, J., Suddendorf, T., Preschoolers begin to differentiate the times of events from throughout the lifespan (2009) European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 6, pp. 746-762; D'Argembeau, A., Van der Linden, M., Phenomenal characteristics associated with projecting oneself back into the past and forward into the future: Influence of valence and temporal distance (2004) Consciousness and Cognition: An International Journal, 13, pp. 844-858; Haith, M.M., The development of future thinking as essential for the emergence of skill in planning (1997) The developmental psychology of planning: Why, how, and when do we plan?, pp. 25-42. , In: Friedman S.

Innovative scenarios assume a shift from mass production to small-scale or even single-unit niche production under diversified demand. This should be accompanied by active promotion of competition not only in shipbuilding but in related industries too. Comparative analysis of scenarios shows that active government policies to support the production of high-technology vessels will generate multiplier effects and strengthen the competitiveness of the Russian economy.","Emerging markets; Foresight; Global challenges; Innovative technologies; Scenarios; Shipbuilding; Technological forecasting",,,,,,"Albright, R.E., Kappel, T.A., Technology roadmapping: Roadmapping the corporation (2003) Research-Technology Management, 46 (2), pp. 31-41; Boelens, R., Minchin, D., O'Sullivan, G., (2005) Climate Change: Implications for Ireland's Marine Environment and Resources.

We base our work on previous experiences and on the results of the research project named ‘Energy Development Strategy for Lower Silesia by Using Foresight Methods’ and carried out by our team from Wroclaw University of Technology (Poland). First of all, we present the idea of regulation in economies and the ‘bottom-up’ approach in programming regional development in the energy sector. The next part of the article concerns the key issues of foresight methodology and the range of its use. The results of our project are presented in the last part of this paper. The main idea is to show how foresight methods and main experts’ methods, e.g. the Delphi method, can successfully support a ‘bottom up’ approach. © 2014, Intersentia N.V.

The relationship between foresight and policy-making has been presented in the literature by the policy-related functions of foresight, but the literature reflects a theoretical gap with the systematic evaluation of the impact of foresight on policy-making. So this study tries to bridge the existing gap by development an evaluation model. The data collection tool is a questionnaire and in order to test the proposed model; a sample of fifteen experts is included. In this article a case study is conducted to implement the confirmed model in the real word and Partial Least Squares (PLSs) path analysis is used to advance our understanding of the relationships and the structure of the proposed model. The results confirm the proposed dimensions of the model and provide insight for those who are concerned with this topic. © 2014 Sage Publications India Pvt. Ltd.

The first one is technology monitoring through observing its current state, and the second one is defining possibly occurring relations among technologies, so as to determine, ultimately, their development schemes. The author investigates the subject matter of determining the current state of technology within foresight research, which could be defined as technology mapping. In her opinion, it is an essential observation element and the basis of technological environment changes predictions. An overview of the selected methods of technology analysis has been provided with the special emphasis on technology mapping. The idea of the method has been presented in the light of the chosen cases of its worldwide application. The usage of the method in the Polish foresight initiative has been described as well as recommendations of its further application. © 2014 IEEE.","diagnosis of current state of technology; foresight; foresight methodology; technology analysis; technology mapping","Contemporary economy; foresight; foresight methodology; IS technologies; Technological environment; Technology analysis; Technology development; Technology mapping; Mapping",,,,,"Warnke, P., Heimeriks, G., Technology foresight as innovation policy instrument: Learning from science and technology studies (2008) Future-Oriented Technology Analysis, , C.

We present an agent-based model showing that there is a close relationship between level of foresight, environmental heterogeneity, and population dispersibility. We explore the dynamics between these three factors and discuss how they may affect the capacity of a hominin population to disperse. Generally, we find that high levels of environmental heterogeneity select for increased foresight and that high levels of foresight tend to reduce dispersibility. This suggests that cognitively complex hominins in heterogeneous environments have low dispersibility relative to cognitively less complex organisms in more homogeneous environments. The model predicts that the environments leading up to major episodes of dispersal, such as the initial hominin dispersal into Eurasia, were likely relatively low in spatial heterogeneity and that the dispersing hominins had relatively low foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-based modelling; Environmental heterogeneity; Hominin cognition; Simulation","cognition; computer simulation; dispersion; heterogeneity; hominid; paleontology; animal; animal dispersal; biological model; cognition; environment; hominid; human; migration; physiology; population migration; Animal Distribution; Animal Migration; Animals; Cognition; Environment; Hominidae; Human Migration; Humans; Models, Biological",,,,,"Aldenderfer, M.S., Computer simulation for archaeology: an introductory essay (1981) Simulations in Archaeology, pp. 67-118. , University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, J.A.

Simply presenting data and having a ""rational"" discussion is not enough to shape perceptions about the future and move people to action. The rapid evolution of digital media technology and the emergence of transmedia storytelling present foresight professionals with a powerful new approach for communicating about the future. Transmedia storytelling is the use of multiple media-graphic novels, video clips on YouTube, blogs, Twitter, and enhanced e-books, for example-to tell one or more related stories set within a common storyworld.

Therefore, the possibility of switching from a perfect foresight to a myopic approach has been implemented. PERSEUS-NET is a linear optimization model generating scenarios of the future German electricity generation system until 2030, whilst considering exogenous regional characteristics such as electricity demand and existing power plants as well as electricity transmission network restrictions. Up to now, the model has been based on a perfect foresight approach, optimizing all variables over the whole time frame in a single run, thus determining the global optimum. However, this approach results in long computing times due to the high complexity of the problem. The new myopic approach splits the optimization intomultiple, individually smaller, optimization problems each representing a 5 year period. The change within the generation system in each period is determined by optimizing the subproblem, whilst taking into account only the restrictions of that particular period. It was found that the optimization over the whole time frame with the myopic approach takes less than one tenth of the computing time of the perfect foresight approach. Therefore, we analyse in this paper the advantages and draw-backs of a change in the foresight as a way of reducing the complexity of energy system models. For PERSEUS-NET it is found that the myopic approach with stable input parameters is as suitable as the perfect foresight approach to generate consistent scenarios, with the advantage of significantly less computing time. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Energy system modelling; Myopic; Perfect foresight; PERSEUS","Energy management; Energy resources; Electricity transmission networks; Electricity-generation system; Energy system modelling; Linear optimization model; Myopic; Perfect foresights; PERSEUS; Regional characteristics; Optimization",,,,,"Möst, D., Genoese, M., Eßer, A., Renz, O., European electricity and emission market modeling-the design of emission allocation plants and its effects on investment planning (2008) 5th Conference on European Electricity Market (EEM), Lisbon; Loulou, R., Remme, U., Kanudia, A., Lehtila, A., Goldstein, G., (2005) Documentation for the TIMES Model, , http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/Documentation.asp; Martinsen, D., Krey, V., Markewitz, P., Vögele, S., A new dynamical bottom-up energy model for Germany: Model structure and model results (2004) 6th IAEE European Conference, Zürich; Rosen, J., (2008) The Future Role of Renewable Energy Sources in European Electricity Supply: A Model-based Analysis for the EU-15, , Dissertation, Universität Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe; Nagl, S., Fürsch, M., Paulus, M., Richter, J., Trüby, J., Lindenberger, D., Energy policy scenarios to reach challenging climate projection targets in the German electricity sector until 2050 (2011) Utility Policy, 19 (3), p. 8; (2011) The Federal Government's Energy Concept of 2010 and the Transformation of the Energy System of 2011, , BMWi, BMU.

Failure to anticipate problems before they escalate results in the need for more costly and time-consuming solutions. Proactive conservation requires forward-looking approaches to decision making that consider possible futures without being overly constrained by the past. Strategic foresight provides a structured process for considering the most desirable future and for mapping the most efficient and effective approaches to promoting that future with tools that facilitate creative thinking. The process involves 6 steps: setting the scope, collecting inputs, analyzing signals, interpreting the information, determining how to act, and implementing the outcomes. Strategic foresight is ideal for seeking, recognizing, and realizing conservation opportunities because it explicitly encourages a broad-minded, forward-looking perspective on an issue. Despite its potential value, the foresight process is rarely used to address conservation issues, and previous attempts have generally failed to influence policy. We present the strategic foresight process as it can be used for proactive conservation planning, describing some of the key tools in the foresight tool kit and how they can be used to identify and exploit different types of conservation opportunities. Scanning is an important tool for collecting and organizing diverse streams of information and can be used to recognize new opportunities and those that could be created. Scenario planning explores how current trends, drivers of change, and key uncertainties might influence the future and can be used to identify barriers to opportunities. Backcasting is used to map out a path to a goal and can determine how to remove barriers to opportunities. We highlight how the foresight process was used to identify conservation opportunities during the development of a strategic plan to address climate change in New York State. The plan identified solutions that should be effective across a range of possible futures. Illustrating the application of strategic foresight to identify conservation opportunities should provide the impetus for decision makers to explore strategic foresight as a way to support more proactive conservation policy, planning, and management. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.","Biodiversity conservation; Conservation policy; Decision making; Environmental futures; Futures research; Strategic planning; Strategic thinking","assessment method; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; decision making; environmental issue; nature conservation; policy making; strategic approach; New York [United States]; United States; climate change; decision making; environmental protection; organization and management; procedures; United States; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; New York; Planning Techniques",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., On concepts and methods in horizon scanning: lessons from initiating policy dialogues on emerging issues (2012) Science and Public Policy, 39, pp. 208-221; Andrews, J., Cameron, H., Harris, M., All change?

This would require a higher level of reference, i.e. pursuing more generic goals. This is offered by the two concepts of ""knowledge society"" and ""participatory governance"". The aim of the research is to develop an impact assessment framework of foresight programmes in developing more participatory ""knowledge societies"" beyond their specific aims.Research shows that the major impacts of foresight belong to three groups, i.e. in relation to knowledge, network creation, and promoting public engagement in policy-making. At the same time, the major features of modern societies are of three types, i.e. related to knowledge value, to innovation-driven growth and to consequences of a ""risk society"". Thus, the relevant areas where foresight might contribute are: knowledge, networking, and coping with a 'risk society'. The new framework is built on the features and pre-conditions of more participatory societies and draws upon existing evaluation approaches and concepts (""theory-based evaluation"", ""knowledge value framework"", ""behavioural"" and ""cognitive capacity additionality"") to tackle short-comings of earlier evaluation efforts. It is then tested in a case study that demonstrates its feasibility and comprehensiveness and further refines the assessment criteria it is based on. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Impact assessment; Participatory societies","Knowledge based systems; Assessment criteria; Cognitive capacity; Evaluation approach; Foresight; Impact assessments; Knowledge society; Participatory societies; Theory-based evaluation; Societies and institutions; feasibility study; governance approach; knowledge; participatory approach; policy making",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., The Greek National Technology Foresight Programme: success is in the eye of the beholder (2014) Int.

The main topic was the creation of a sustainable and reliable information and analytical database for use by stakeholders. In Russia, database development has been encouraged by the establishment of a national system of technological forecasting, which emerges from the increased demand for quality in forecasting research. Presentations were made by world renowned experts - representatives of the EU Joint Research Centre - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS); Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands; Finland Futures Research Center (FFRC), the University of Turku, Finland; HSE and other organizations. They presented findings about best practices in quantitive research and the newest ICT-based tools in Foresight studies worldwide. These will be used in preparing a scientific and methodological base for the next round of Russia's Long-Term S&T Foresight. Workshop participants discussed the prospects and challenges of integrating qualitative and quantitative methods in Foresight analysis. International experts described the potential for applying modeling techniques and data visualization for promising technologies and products, presented state-of-the-art simulation tools for developing quantitative scenarios for S&T, and shared experiences in the use of online games in future studies. The development of these and similar techniques, in the view of the participants, provides a greater space for improving the Foresight methodology and the cooperation of specialists in qualitative and quantitative methods. It is assumed that in the medium term, these tools will be a part of the gold standard for any definitive Foresight study. Most experts agreed that the integration of qualitative and quantitative methods enriches the Foresight methodology and increases synergies from mutual learning of specialists in collaborative projects.",,,,,,,"Bryant, B., Lempert, R., Thinking inside the box: A participatory, computer-assisted approach to scenario discovery (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (1), pp. 34-49; Coccia, M., Technometrics: Origins, historical evolution and new directions (2005) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 72 (8), pp. 944-979. , DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.05.011, PII S004016250500079X; (2010) EFMN: Mapping Foresight.

The purpose of this article is to review these various traditions and discourses to understand the context within which different approaches can be valuable, and expand the basis by which we can develop Anticipatory Governance strategies.

Various consultations with the major players and the general public were involved. The aim was to produce recommendations for an energy bill in autumn 2013, but, because the participants could not come to any agreement, it was simply a summary of these debates that was submitted to the government in July 2013. With each party holding fast to its position, the process has come to a standstill. The drafting of the bill has been deferred to spring 2014, the intention being to present it to Parliament in the autumn and for it to be passed before the end of the year. Among the points listed in this summary is a proposal for restarting the process by ""carrying out a shared foresight exercise, informed by macro-economic scenarios for France and Europe, microeconomic modelling and multicriteria studies drawing on the partnership methods of the General Commission for Strategy and Foresight"". This is an important point since, in this type of debate, aimed at providing long-term orientation for French energy policy, the contribution of foresight studies is key. Nevertheless, as is shown by this article, a product of the PROSPER foresight network and its thinking, foresight exercises on energy matters, torn as they are between quantitative methods and qualitative approaches often tinged with subjectivity, have difficulty convincing decision-makers or leading to political measures or strategies that can garner a minimum degree of assent. Yet what is at issue here is necessarily finding some accommodation between quantitative and qualitative approaches, overcoming obstacles produced by mutual misunderstanding on the part of supporters of those two approaches and seeking compromises between actors with very different points of view. In this connection, as this article shows, three quite recent energy foresight exercises have striven, with encouraging results, to reconcile the qualitative and the quantitative so as to develop scenarios that are both relevant and acceptable to the different actors concerned. David et al. outline the main characteristics of these studies and the lessons to be drawn from them with a view to developing a foresight exercise that enough people can get behind and that is likely to produce a scenario acceptable to a majority.",,,,,,,"C'est Éric Besson, alors ministre en charge de l'Énergie, qui l'a installée officiellement le 20 octobre 2011, sous la coprésidence de Jacques Percebois et Claude Mandil","David, B.; CEA, Commissariat à l'Ánergie Atomique et aux Ánergies Renouvelables, PROSPERFrance",,,,,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

It is therefore surprising that few studies have examined how the related capacity for episodic foresight might also be affected in this age group. Preliminary evidence suggests that older adults show deficits in generating phenomenological characteristics of future events, but the critical question of whether such deficits extend to generating and executing appropriate future intentions remains to be addressed. Here, we present 2 studies. In Study 1, we report the results of our pilot testing, which was used to develop and validate stimuli for the first measure of this construct that is appropriate for use in adult populations. In Study 2, we administer this measure to 40 older and 40 younger adults. The results indicate that, relative to their younger counterparts, older adults are less likely to spontaneously acquire items that would later allow a problem to be solved, and are also less likely to subsequently use these items to solve the problems. These data provide important initial evidence that the capacity to apply episodic foresight in a functionally adaptive way is impaired in late adulthood. The results also provide important validation data for a novel measure of episodic foresight that has potential application to many other groups, including clinical groups known to have difficulties anticipating and planning for the future. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Aging; Episodic foresight; Mental time travel; Self-generation; VW-foresight","adult; aged; aging; Article; cognitive defect; controlled study; episodic memory; executive function; female; groups by age; human; male; mental deterioration; psychologic test; reading; verbal communication; adolescent; aging; behavior; executive function; pilot study; problem solving; psychology; recognition; reproducibility; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Memory, Episodic; Pilot Projects; Problem Solving; Recognition (Psychology); Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Musicaro, R., Pan, L., Schacter, D.L., Episodic simulation of past and future events in older adults: Evidence from an experimental recombination task (2010) Psychology and Aging, 25, pp. 369-376; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Age-related changes in the episodic simulation of future events (2008) Psychological Science, 19, pp. 33-41; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5, pp. 533-539; Buckner, R.L., Carroll, D.C., Self-projection and the brain (2007) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, pp. 49-57; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159; Crawford, J.R., Deary, I.J., Starr, J., Whalley, L.J., The NART as an index of prior intellectual functioning: A retrospective validity study covering a 66-year interval (2001) Psychological Medicine, 31, pp. 451-458; Henry, J.D., MacLeod, M.S., Phillips, L.H., Crawford, J.R., A meta-analytic review of prospective memory and aging (2004) Psychology and Aging, 19, pp. 27-39; Kliegel, M., McDaniel, M., Einstein, G., Plan formation, retention, and execution in prospective memory: A new approach and agerelated effects (2000) Memory & Cognition, 28, pp. 1041-1049; Lezak, M.D., Howieson, D.B., Loring, D.W., (2004) Neuropsychological assessment, , (4th ed.).

Design/methodology/approach: The method used is based on a secondary analysis and interpretation of Foresight studies. The underlying assumption is that Foresight exercises can be considered as the scene where techno-economic systems and trajectories are proposed, discussed and shaped. Findings: Foresights can be distinguished by the challenges and issues they focus on: - the innovation race: competitiveness and influence through innovation, - the thematic concerns: the stakes of global public goods, - the normative perspectives: a new style of development in the making. The question to know whether Europe can be a world driver in fostering responsible innovation models and cooperative modes of knowledge circulation and global challenges handling through relevant social and technological innovations. Originality/value: This paper reviews and puts in perspective Foresight exercises in an original way, this on two grounds: first, it includes exercises fostered at national, regional (in particular the EU) and global (UN system) levels - this to account for the emerging multi-level governance and, second, it classifies them according to their major focus, namely the innovation race, the thematic concerns (global public goods) and the normative perspectives (new style of development). It provides to the actors of innovation in both the public and private sector an understanding of the current key-concerns and visions on innovation systems and the position of Europe. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Europe; Foresight; Global public goods; Governance of science; Innovation systems",,,,,,"Adams, J., Global research report, China, November (2009) Evidence; Barré, R., Prospective et recherche (2009) Sciences En Campagne - Regards croisés, passés Et à Venir, pp. 286-292. , Hervieu, B., Hubert, B.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of collaborative, bottom-up strategic planning as a complement to top-down strategizing. Large research institutions plan investment over long time horizons and must cope with significant uncertainty, complexity, and mandate changes. Collaborative foresight enhances organizational resilience by improving ideation, problem definition, and consensus in long-horizon strategies. It increases the variety of perspectives in scenario creation, resulting in improved strategic options. Structured Dialogic Design (SDD) was employed as a complementary strategic planning method to the mandated Capabilities-Based Planning (CBP) process. The two methods were conducted in parallel sessions with different organizational participants, strictly limiting information sharing between teams. Participants using SDD to plan efficiently produced a detailed structure representing long-horizon strategic challenges and solution ideas. This collaborative foresight approach demonstrated strong consensus for organizational priorities defined in scenarios and investment pathways. The SDD method demonstrated that transactive and generative planning integrated with traditional rational planning and surpassed it by incorporating deep tacit knowledge from diverse participants. It also fostered organizational cohesion through facilitated collaboration in the planning sessions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Collaborative planning; Influence mapping; Strategic foresight; Strategy; Structured dialogic design","Research; Strategic planning; Collaborative planning; Information sharing; Problem definition; Research institutions; Research organization; Strategic challenges; Strategic foresight; Strategy; Investments; government; planning method; planning process; research institution; strategic approach",,,,,"Lewis, L., Roll, C.R., Strategy-to-Tasks: A Methodology for Resource Allocation and Management (1993) RAND Technical Report P-7839; Bahrani, A., Yuan, J., Emele, C.D., Masato, D., Norman, T.J., Mott, D., Collaborative and Context-aware Planning (2008) Proc. of the Military Communications Conference, pp. 1-7; Popper, R., How are foresight methods selected?

This KMIS is dealt by an integrative perspective for a dynamic framework. The focus is given to three decisive components-communication, navigation and multicontact relationship that represent the current 'open nature' of knowledge. This perspective increases, through KM, the role of intellectual capital keeping value in a transition towards research change. Foresight thinking represents an enabler to drive this change in public research organization and Science & Technology Foresight Project and Horizon Scanning, as practice perspectives, are reported in this paper. They have an inclusive and engaging nature based on a participatory process with a bottom-up approach and represent concrete actions enabling the research intellectual capital to move fast toward a research change transition considering cross-cutting aspects for increasing impacts related to technological developments. The monitor of constraints and barriers helps to identify short term issues to be assessed and overcome for success of the undertaking.","Accumulation of knowledge; Intellectual capital; Participatory foresight; Research and innovation","Accumulation of knowledge; Intellectual capital; Participatory foresight; Participatory process; Practice perspectives; Research organization; Technological development; Technology foresight; Knowledge management",,,,,"Accordino, F., (2013) The Futurium - A Foresight Platform for Evidence-Based and Participatory Policymaking, , Philos.

The potential benefits of public procurement might be fully exploited through the acquisition not only of appliances which are already available in the market, but also of new appliances which are tailored to the specific needs of the local community and might be exported as well to the international markets. In this way, public procurement might allow to improve the services delivered to the local community and to increase the technological competitiveness of the local industrial and research system. In this context, regional foresight might help identify both long-term societal needs and the patterns of evolution of emerging technologies that can match these needs.

Unfortunately, such floods are likely to recur with greater intensity and frequency in future with climate change and rapid urbanisation.

Participants read vignettes describing hypothetical experiments, along with the result of the initial observation, considered as either a possibility (foresight) or a reality (hindsight). Experiment 1 found that the initial observation seemed more likely to be replicated when viewed in hindsight than in foresight. The remaining experiments contrasted responses to an initial observation from 1 of the 4 studies that was either expected or unexpected (based on the predictions of participants in Experiment 1). Experiments 2A-C and Experiment 3 found that unexpected results were more likely to be attributed to methodological problems than were expected ones-but to the same degree in foresight and in hindsight. Participants in Experiment 4 had more confidence in an explanation for an unexpected outcome when it was mentioned before that outcome was revealed than when it was suggested only after the surprise was known. In all the experiments, most participants recommended collecting more data before publishing the results, especially when they attributed the results to multiple causes. The results suggest that considering the causes of unexpected experimental results in foresight may improve the evaluation and communication of those results in hindsight. ©2013 American Psychological Association.","Causal reasoning; Confirmation bias; Data sharing; File-drawer problem; Hindsight bias","adolescent; adult; aged; article; decision making; female; human; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; physiology; probability; uncertainty; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Communication; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Probability; Uncertainty; Young Adult",,,,,"Baker, L.M., Dunbar, K., Experimental design heuristics for scientific discovery: The use of ""baseline"" and ""known standard"" controls (2000) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 53, pp. 335-349. , doi:10.1006/ijhc.2000.0393; Blank, H., Musch, J., Pohl, R., Hindsight bias: On being wise after the event (2007) Social Cognition, 25, pp. 1-9. , doi:10.1521/soco.2007.25.1.1; Blank, H., Nestler, S., Cognitive process models of hindsight bias (2007) Social Cognition, 25, pp. 132-146. , doi:10.1521/soco.2007.25.1.132; Bradley, J., (2007) Open notebook science using blogs and wikis.

According to Jansen, ""intention"" has two commonsense meanings, one of which is equivalent to ""foresight."" Consequently, questions about intention are ""infected"" with ambiguity-people cannot tell what they mean and do not know how to answer them. This hypothesis is unsupported by evidence, but Jansen states it as if it were accepted fact. In this reply, we make explicit the multiple misrepresentations she has employed to make her hypothesis seem plausible. We also point out the ways in which it defies common sense. In particular, Jansen applies her thesis only to recent empirical research on the intentions of doctors, totally ignoring the widespread confusion that her assertion would imply in everyday life, in law, and indeed in religious and philosophical writings concerning the intention/foresight distinction and the Principle of Double Effect. © 2014 The Author.","double effect; end-of-life; foresight; intention; sedation","behavior; ethics; euthanasia; human; medical ethics; palliative therapy; philosophy; terminal care; Double Effect Principle; Euthanasia; Humans; Intention; Palliative Care; Philosophy, Medical; Terminal Care",,,,,"Anscombe, G.E.M., (1958) Intention, , Oxford: Basil Blackwell; Bennett, J., (1998) The Act Itself, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bratman, M.E., (1987) Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Cantor, N.L., Thomas, G.C., The legal bounds of physician conduct hastening death (2000) Buffalo Law Review, 48, pp. 83-173; Cherny, N.I., Radbruch, L., European association for palliative care (eapc) recommended framework for the use of sedatio n in palliative care (2009) Palliative Medicine, 23, p. 581. , and the board of the european association for palliative care; Delaney, N.F., Two cheers for ""closeness "" terror, targeting and double effect (2008) Philosophical Studies, 137, pp. 335-367; Douglas, C., Kerridge, I., Ankeny, R., Managing intentions: The end-of-life administration of analgesics and sedatives, and the possibility of slow euthanasia (2008) Bioethics, 22, pp. 388-396; Douglas, C., Kerridge, I., Ankeny, R., Narratives of "" terminal sedation,"" and the importance of the intention-Foresight distinction in palliative care practice (2013) Bioethics, 27, pp. 1-11; Foot, P., The problem of abortion and the doctrine of double effect (2001) The Doctrine of D Ouble Effect: Philosophers Debate A Controversial Moral Principle, pp. 143-155. , ed.

JST is also in the process of creating 'J-GLOBAL foresight' [http://foresight.jst.go.jp (accessed June 2012)] in order to match up a variety of data such as results and indices of bibliometric analysis as well as of patent analysis derived from the knowledge infrastructure with applications like Google Maps and facilitate the visualisation of business information. This will contribute to help companies and institutions formulate business strategy based on the information obtained in the future. The former aims to be the bibliographic information version of the Data.gov, which discloses government data from the USA, while the latter seeks to be the Data-gov wiki version, which provides a demonstration by matching up governmental data with applications such as Google Maps. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","bibliometric analysis; cluster analysis; Data-gov wiki; Data.gov; foresight; J-GLOBAL; patent analysis","cluster analysis; corporate strategy; database; intellectual property rights; science and technology; World Wide Web",,,,,"Ding, L., DiFranzo, D., McGiunness, D.L., Heudler, J., Magidson, S., The Data-gov wiki: a semantic web portal for linked government data (2012), http://logd.tw.rpi.edu/files/paper188.pdf, Available at (accessed 22 June 2012; Jibu, M., Science of future approach - an overview of foresight (2011) Journal of Information Processing and Management, 54, pp. 200-209. , (in Japanese; Jibu, M., An analysis of achievements of JST operations through scientific patenting: Linkage between patents and scientific papers (2011), pp. 214-220. , Paper presented at Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy, 15 September 2011, IEEE, pp; Lakhani, K.R., Autstin, R.D., Yi, Y., Data.gov (2010), Harvard Business School, 7 May 2010; Obama, B., Memorandum for the Head of Executive Department and Agencies (2008), http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Transparency_and_Open_Government/, Available at, (accessed 8 August 2011; Porter, A.L., Ashton, W.B., Foresight in the USA (2008) In The Handbook of Technology Foresight, 154. , In: Georghiou Luke, Harper Jennifer C., Keenn Michael, Miles Ian, Popper Rafael, editors Cheltenham, Cheltenham,: Edward Elgar; Rohrbeck, R., Gemunden, H.G., Corporate foresight: Its three roles in enhancing the innovation capacity of a firm (2011) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 78, pp. 231-243; Yamaguchi, E., Structure of innovation - 'the field of resonance management for realizing ""paradigm-disruptive"" innovation (2003), Invited lecture at the International Consortium for Management of Technology, 2003","Jibu, M.; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Tokyo, Japan; email: m2jibu@jst.go.jp",,,"Routledge",,,,,09537325,,,,"English","Technol.

This paper prospects the evolution of winegrowing in the region through scenario simulation in a Multi-Agent System model. The model is confronted with the difficulties of combining real data with expert knowledge. Entry data are the cadastral map, land-use and land-use plans, economic data on winegrowers and several external parameters. Spatial strategic foresight is exploratory and does not determine a certain future for the study area. The starting point is the simulation of a trend scenario. Alternative scenarios are later elaborated by modifying coherently the parameter set of the geosimulations. Their goal is to understand the possible consequences of departures from trend dynamics on the study area and its winegrowing economy. The paper shows the interest of using a MAS model, developed from real-world data, in order to simulate scenarios for spatial strategic foresight. Under the constraint of a set of hypotheses, the MAS model produces spatial forms for possible futures of the Bandol region and shows the overall resilience of its winegrowing economy. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Geosimulation; Land-Use; Multi-Agent Systems; Spatial Strategic Foresight; Urban Pressure; Winegrowing","Land use; Multi agent systems; Cadastral maps; Expert knowledge; Geosimulation; Land-use plan; Multi-agent system model; Scenario simulations; Strategic foresight; Winegrowing; Computer simulation",,,,,"Benenson, I., Torrens, P.M., (2004) Geosimulation: Automata-Based Modeling of Urban Phenomena, , John Wiley & Sons, London; Fusco, G., Démarche géo-prospective et modélisation causale probabiliste (2012) Cybergéo, 613. , http://cybergeo.revues.org/25423; Fusco, G., Caglioni, M., Quel avenir pour les paysages de la vigne?

IF represents an approach for bringing the future into holistic innovation processes, in which users and other stakeholders are systematically involved to detect future opportunities and risks. This could allow for a better integration of inclusive, long-term visions in decision-making and strategic thinking in the context of innovation. To be effective and enable mutual learning, the IF process calls for future-oriented, continuous interaction with current/anticipated users and a better integration of methods and approaches from different fields, including Foresight, user/market research and human-centred product design. This paper discusses two empirical studies that closely involved users in the exploration, imagination and creation of future TV experiences. Study 1 aimed to identify users' specific (future) needs and possible Lead User ideas concerning digital TV (DTV) in Flanders through an online survey (N= 11.802 digital TV users). 13 unique ideas representing important unfulfilled needs were identified and evaluated. Study 2, which focused on 'Future TV experiences', consisted of a multi-method research approach in three phases, resulting in six persona profiles, that help to provide an understanding of users' daily practices and futures aspirations. It is argued that a better introduction of future anticipation in inclusive innovation processes could enhance the input of users in innovation and contribute to the detection of potential user/societal needs and possible unexpected forms of use. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Future TV experiences; Innovation foresight; Interaction; User involvement; User practices","conceptual framework; decision making; detection method; future prospect; holistic approach; innovation; research work; stakeholder; strategic approach; television; Belgium; Flanders",,,,,"Chesbrough, H., (2003) Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston; Trott, P., Hartman, D., Why 'open innovation' is old wine in new bottles (2009) International Journal of Innovation Management, 13, pp. 715-736; Cagnin, C., Loveridge, D., Saritas, O., FTA and equity: new approaches to governance (2010) Futures, 43, pp. 279-291; Warnke, P., Heimeriks, G., Technology Foresight as innovation policy instrument: learning from science and technology studies (2008) Future-Oriented Technology Analysis: Strategic Intelligence for an Innovative Economy, pp. 71-87. , Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, C.

For supporting the unicast communication primitive, it is important to know the electronic identities (EIDs), e.g., the IP addresses and the relative positions of the nearby vehicles. We show that the estimated GPS coordinates alone are not accurate enough to uniquely identify the intended vehicle. On the other hand, there is an increasing array of devices, such as on-board camera, RADAR, and DSRC radio that are becoming available in newer vehicles. These heterogeneously deployed devices provide information sources that have varying levels of accuracy and potentially different coverage regions, making it challenging to accurately identify the vehicle. As a first step, we design ForeSight, a system that dynamically integrates the information observed in the visual domain (e.g., from camera) and the electronic domain (e.g., WiFi radio) to match the vehicles observed in these two domains with high accuracy. The experiment and simulation results show that ForeSight is able to significantly improve the vehicle identification accuracy compared to using GPS or other algorithms. In our case study, ForeSight reduces disturbing messages by 14 × as compared to the number of a GPS-based communication method. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Cameras; Communication; Global positioning system; Signal receivers; Vehicles; Autonomous cruise control; Collaborative driving; Communication method; Electronic identity; Information sources; Unicast communication; Vehicle identification; Vehicular applications; Vehicle to vehicle communications",,,,,"Wisitpongphan, N., Broadcast storm mitigation techniques in vehicular ad hoc networks (2007) IEEE Wireless Communications, 14 (6), pp. 84-94; Yang, X., Liu, J., Vaidya, N., Zhao, F., A vehicle-to-vehicle communication protocol for cooperative collision warning (2004) Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking and Services, pp. 114-123. , August; Li, D., Bansal, T., Lu, Z., Sinha, P., MARVEL: Multiple antenna based relative vehicle localizer (2012) Proc. of ACM MOBICOM; (2012) Google Discloses Costs of Its Driverless Car Tests, , http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/06/ google-discloses-costs-of-its-driverless-car-tests/1#.UfA7BchCHe; Moustafa, H., Zhang, Y., (2009) Vehicular Networks: Techniques, Standards, and Applications, , Auerbach publications; Mitchell, H.B., (2007) Multi-sensor Data Fusion: An Introduction, , Springer; De Hoon, M.J., Imoto, S., Nolan, J., Miyano, S., Open source clustering software (2004) Bioinformatics, 20 (9), pp. 1453-1454; Simulation of Urban Mobility, , http://sumo.sourceforge.net; The NS-3 Network Simulator, , http://www.nsnam.org; (2008) Global Positioning System Standard Positioning Service Performance Standard, , GPS.gov; Wang, Q., Lobzhanidze, A., Roy, S.D., Zeng, W., Shang, Y., Positionit: An image-based remote target localization system on smartphones (2011) Proc. of ACM Multimedia; (2011) 2011 Automotive Color Popularity Report, , http://www2.dupont.com/MediaCenter/enUS/colorpopularity/index.html, DuPont Media Center; Schanda, J., (2007) Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System, , Wiley-interscience; Kim, S., Front and rear vehicle detection and tracking in the day and night times using vision and sonar sensor fusion (2005) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems; Mobus, R., Kolbe, U., Multi-target multi-object tracking, sensor fusion of radar and infrared (2004) Proc. of IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium; Hue, C., Le Cadre, J.-P., Pérez, P., Sequential monte carlo methods for multiple target tracking and data fusion (2002) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 50 (2), pp. 309-325; Cox, I.J., A review of statistical data association techniques for motion correspondence (1993) International Journal of Computer Vision, 10 (1), pp. 53-66; Huang, T., Russell, S., Object identification in a Bayesian context (1997) International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence; She, K., Bebis, G., Gu, H., Miller, R., Vehicle tracking using on-line fusion of color and shape features (2004) Proc. of Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Our scheduling problem is difficult to solve using traditional methods due to continuous and high-dimensional state space. However, foresight optimization restricts the sequence of action mappings to be a stationary action sequence and gives rise to the upper bound of the objective function value, leading to an approximate solution. Furthermore, unscented transformation sampling combined with extended Kalman filtering is proposed to provide an approximate evaluation of the upper bound that results from an action sequence. To determine the best action sequence efficiently, a pruning algorithm is incorporated into the tree-search techniques. The feasibility and effectiveness of our non-myopic schemes are verified in a simple simulation experiment that involves multiple radars tracking a single target.

The Delphi survey technique finds broad acceptance as a decision support and forecasting tool. Recent research has discussed the composition of Delphi panels and whether company internal or external panelists should be consulted for strategic foresight. We make a contribution to this discussion by investigating whether internal and external participants of Delphi studies lead to differing results and how the differences can be utilized by decision makers. We consider differences that might be inherent not only to quantitative but also to qualitative Delphi data. Results of our research reveal that there are several significant differences between the two panels' evaluations, which lead to varying consultation practices for different strategic purposes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Advice seeking; Decision making; Delphi; Expert; Multiple stakeholder","Decision making; Decision support systems; Advice seeking; Decision supports; Delphi; Expert; Forecasting tools; Multiple stakeholders; Recent researches; Strategic foresight; Industry; accuracy assessment; decision making; Delphi analysis; expert system; forecasting method; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; strategic approach",,,,,"Day, G.S., Schoemaker, P.J.H., Driving through the fog: managing at the edge (2004) Long Range Plan., 37, pp. 127-142; Yaniv, I., Receiving other people's advice: influence and benefit (2004) Organ.

Therefore, research in this arena on current and future developments is required to make strategic decisions. Under this context, the goal of this research is to develop a patent analysis on additive manufacturing. Keyword-patent analysis is performed to identify the most important organizations, countries, inventors, and technology areas through International Patent Classifications (IPCs) of the additive manufacturing industry. Results show that there is an increase on additive manufacturing research, particularly in 2013 and 2014. The main areas of research are focused on shaping of plastics and after-treatment of shaped products and working metallic powder and manufacture articles from this material. Moreover, the analysis indicates that leading countries on additive manufacturing research are United States, Great Britain and Switzerland. Additionally, top three companies on this area are: Stratasys Inc. (USA), United Technologies Corp. (USA) and Alstom Technology LTD (Switzerland). Its recent research inventions were identified in this study. The main contribution of this research is to offer a template for analysis in other industries, but it also brings valuable insights to decision makers interested in recent patent efforts developed for the advancement of additive manufacturing.","Additive manufacturing; Foresight; Patent analysis; Strategic foresight",,,,,,"Balbi, E., Prospectiva, una herramienta de acción (2001), 5 (1), pp. 12-18. , http://dspace.uces.edu.ar:8180/dspace/bitstream/handle/123456789/360/Prospectiva_una_herramienta_de_acci%F3n.pdf?sequence=1, Revista científica de UCES, Retrived from; Basiliere, P., Market Guide for 3D Printing (2014), Gartner; Basiliere, P., Shandler, M., Hype Cycle for 3D Printing, 2014 (2014), Gartner; Beer, N., Additive manufacturing.

This approach combines scenarios about change in Land Use, LandCover and territorial foresight in the context of a participatory workshop. The scenarios are built by using modeling and simulation tools. Maps of potential land use in 2030 are produced and discussed in the workshop. After a review of territorial foresight and geoprospective concepts, we detail the organization of the workshop, the elaboration of the simulation models and the results of the project. Then, we address the question of interest and limits of using LULC modeling and simulation techniques in a territorial prospective, relying on the remarks of participants and our own observations. © CNRS-UMR Géographie-cités 8504.","Land use; Participatory workshop; Scenario building; Spatial land cover modeling; Spatial strategic foresight; Territory","capacity building; catchment; land use change; metropolitan area; participatory approach; simulation; spatial planning; strategic approach; territorial management; France; Lyons; Rhone; Rhone-Alpes; Yzeron River",,,,,"Agreste, 2011, L'occupation physique du territoire en 2010.

This approach combines scenarios about change in LandUse, LandCover and territorial foresight in the context of a participatory workshop. The scenarios are built by using modeling and simulation tools. Maps of potential land use in 2030 are produced and discussed in the workshop. After a rev iew of territorial foresight and geoprospectiv e concepts, we detail the organization of the workshop, the elaboration of the simulation models and the results of the project. Then, we address the question of interest and limits of using LULC modeling and simulation techniques in a territorial prospectiv e, rely ing on the remarks of participants and our own observations. © CNRS-UMR Géographie-cités 8504.","Land use; Participatory workshop; Scenario building; Spatial land cover modeling; Spatial strategic foresight; Territory","catchment; critical analysis; future prospect; land cover; land use change; metropolitan area; modeling; periurban area; spatial analysis; territory; France; Lyons; Rhone; Rhone-Alpes; Yzeron River",,,,,"Agreste, (2011) L'Occupation Phy Sique du Territoire en 2010, , http://agreste.agriculture.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf_teruti2011T7.pdf, TABLEAU no 6.2: Év olution de l'occupation du sol entre 2006 et 2010; Berger, G., Sciences humaines et prévision (1957) Revue des Deux Mondes, (3), pp. 417-426; Berger, G., L'attitude prospectiv e (1958) Prospective, (1), pp. 1-10; Braud, I., (2011) Rapport Final du Projet AVuPUR (Assessing the Vulenability of Peri Urban Rivers), 48p. , http://avupur.hydrowide.com/?id_article=7, coord., ANR Vulnérabilité Milieu Climat 2007, Lyon, Cemagref; Casanova, L., Prospective territoriale et démarche d'analy se spatiale.

Korea performs TF every 5 years to establish science and technology policy and strategies. In the 4th TF, future technologies that might be developed by 2035 were discovered and Delphi survey was conducted to examine current development status, anticipated times of technology development and public use, plans to secure these technologies, etc. Design/methodology/approach-This paper divides procedure employed in the 4th TF into three steps and explains seven characteristics related to its procedure. Findings-Improvement of the TF procedure will increase the reliability and applicability of its results. Originality/value-This paper consists of original results which include improved procedure and its implication by researchers who participated in the 4th TF. It will provide a useful example for other nations, hoping to introduce TF to set up national science and technology policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Procedural characteristics; Technology foresight",,,,,,"Cuhls, K., Future trends in science and technology.

These social learning processes do not claim to know about the future but instead call for learning with alternative futures to become more agile and adaptive, overcome inertia and create movement. We illustrate this process of large scale systems transition through reference to a specific case study on the futures of Europe. The initiative combines a variety of futures methods - scenarios, visioning and value creation modeling - to support an open-ended process of collaborative innovation and empower the co-creation of new potentialities.1 Learning developed in this multi-stakeholder, multi-method transformational foresight initiative is relevant to a wide range of scholars and practitioners in different fields with interests in collabrative strategy, complex systems redesign, transition management. Key lessons include the value of convening both institutional insiders and outsiders, the benefits of opening up the past to look forward, and the resourcing challenges in sustaining an open-ended process and nourishing a new and still fragile network of actors.","Civil society; Co-creation; Collaborative futures; Design; Europe; European union; Futures methods; Innovation; Learning with futures; Transformational foresight; Transition management; Whole systems innovation",,,,,,"Ackoff, R.L., Idealized design: Creative corporate visioning (1993) OMEGA, 21 (4), pp. 401-410; Beck, L.G., Metaphors of Educational Community: An Analysis of the Images that Reflect and Influence Scholarship and Practice Educational Administration Quarterly (1999) The Journal of Leadership for Effective & Equitable Organizations, 35 (1), pp. 13-45; Checkland, P., (1993) Systems Thinking, Systems Practice, , San Fransico, CA: John Wiley and Sons; Dehaene, M., De Vree, D., Design research for sustainability transitions: managing multiple forms of Knowledge in a context of irreducible uncertain- ty (2013) AESOP/ACSP 5th Joint Congress 2013, , eBook of abstracts; Emery, F., Trist, E., The causal texture of organizational environments (1965) Human Relations, 18 (1), pp. 21-32; Geels, F.W., Schot, J., Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways (2007) Research Policy, 36 (3), pp. 399-417; Grin, J., Rotmans, J., Schot, J., (2010) Transitions to Sustainable Development: New Directions in the Study of Long Term Transformative Change, , Londen: Routledge; Hiltunen, E., Crowdsourcing the Future: The Foresight Process at Finpro (2011) Journal of Futures Studies, 16 (1), pp. 189-196; Jain, A., Arden, J., Pickard, J., Design Futurescaping (2012) Journal of Futures Studies, 17 (1), pp. 111-116; Kahane, A., (2012) Transformative Scenario Planning, , San Francisco, CA: Berrett-Koehler; Kuosa, T., Evolution of Futures Studies (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 327-336; Mermet, L., Strategic Environmental Management Analysis: Addressing the Blind Spots of Collaborative Approaches (2011) Working Papers IDDRI no.5/2011, , Paris; Naim, M., The End of Power: From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States, Why Being In Charge Isn't What It Used to Be New York: Basic Books Raford, N.

The proposed approaches can be effectively applied both for a preliminary forecast of possible disasters and for modelling, preparation and evaluation ofmeasures to prevent and control potential disasters. Methods also allow obtaining and improving of the control and managing in disasters, and provide decision-making support for disaster situations. Developed approaches are very flexible to use in systems of various nature, such as technical, environmental, social, human, economic and others. Developed tools allow reducing the time, financial and human resources for recovering from the effects of disasters in conditions under inaccuracy, incompleteness, fuzziness, untimeliness, noncredibility, and contradictoriness of information. © Springer ScienceCBusiness Media Dordrecht 2014.",,,,,,,"Balakrishnan, A.V., (1984) Kalman filtering theory.

To improve a part of its experimental units and adapt them to the future research context, the Animal Physiology and Livestock Division of INRA engaged in a foresight operation in 2005. Based on a more general foresight exercise carried out at the national level (INRA 2020), different scenarios were built and then analysed for the 2025 horizon by a working group under the responsibility of an external chairman. Consulting professional partners, local councillors and employees of the concerned units was the basis for constructing these scenarios. Finally, four scenarios were submitted to the INRA General Direction who chose the European infrastructure. It was then declined into 8 operational scenarios evaluated by 6 main criteria concerning: i) the experimental capacity; ii) the efficiency of the system; iii) the environmental balance sheet; iv) the feasibility of its development; v) the buildings, facilities, demolitions required and their estimated costs; and vi) the human resources. Finally, this scenario has been implemented in its social, land, real estate and functional dimensions since 2009. At each step of the process, an important work of sharing and explaining the reflexions and decisions has been carried out, making it possible for concerned individuals to share the objectives, understand the collective challenges and be involved in this general mutation. This innovative foresight approach, exploring in successive steps constructed and shared scenarios, will allow a strong evolution of the experimental units, based on a rationale, well-argued and figured approach driven by external and internal developments in agricultural research.","Agricultural research; Animal science; Experimentation",,,,,,"Barendse, W., The effect of measurement error of phenotypes on genome wide association studies (2011) BMC Genomics, 12, p. 232; de Jouvenel, H., INRA 2020.

In this perspective, INRA and CIRAD launched the initiative, in 2006, to develop a foresight project for analysing issues pertaining to the world's food and agricultural systems on the 2050 timeline. This book provides a synthetic presentation of the main conclusions that this foresight project has yielded. First, it recapitulates the main statistical references for the period 1961 to 2003, before going on to describe the Agribiom simulation tool used to calculate food biomass resource use balances. Two scenarios on the 2050 timeline are then considered: Agrimonde GO is a trend-based scenario that bets on economic growth to feed the world, in a context where environmental protection is not a priority; in contrast, the idea in Agrimonde 1 is to feed the world while preserving its ecosystems. © Éditions Quæ, 2014.",,,,,,,"Altieri, M.A., (1987) Agroecology: The Scientific Basis of Alternative Agriculture, p. 227. , Westview Press, Boulder; Basdevant, A., Obesite humaine: Origine et consequences (2003) Pour Une Approche Scientifique De l’obesite.

Then, we use historical Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) data from 2011-2012 to evaluate the maximum potential revenue from a hypothetical 32 MWh, 8 MW system. We investigate the maximum potential revenue from two different scenarios: arbitrage only and arbitrage combined with regulation. Our analysis shows that, with perfect foresight, participation in the regulation market would have produced more than twice the revenue compared to arbitrage in the ERCOT market in 2011 and 2012. Three simple trading strategies that do not rely on perfect knowledge are then compared to the optimization results. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Linear programming; Day ahead market; Electrical energy storages; Perfect foresights; Potential revenue; Regulation markets; Trading strategies; Power quality",,,,,"Eyer, J., Corey, G., Energy storage for the electricity grid: Benefits and market potential assessment guide (2010) Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, Tech.

SB is a complicated matter with various factors involved. In the past decades, the traditional SB treatment (SBT) approaches are getting invalid due to the environment changing on social, economical, technological, political, and cultural aspects. In such rapid changing world, innovation is perceived as an ideal means of reactivating declining affairs. This paper presents an innovation study aiming at inviting Knowledge Management (KM) to support SBT. With operating a technology foresight (TF) based process, a vision network implicating eight essential KM-supported SBT initiatives are determined. The introduced study may not only contribute to designing new SBT functions, but sketch a considerable business model for stakeholders to modernize SBT services. © 2014 IEEE.","ICT; Knowledge Management; School Bullying; Service Innovation; Technology Foresight","Knowledge management; Business modeling; Cultural aspects; ICT; Innovation studies; School Bullying; Service innovation; Technology foresight; Engineering research",,,,,"Besag, V.E., (1989) Bullies and Victims in Schools: A Guide to Understanding and Management, , Open University Press ISBN 978-0-335-09542-1; Brank, E.M., Hoetger, L.A., Hazen, K.P., Bullying (2012) Annual Review of Law and Social Science, (Annual Reviews), 8, pp. 213-230; Bolton, J., Graeve, S., (2005) No Room for Bullies: From the Classroom to Cyberspace, , Boys Town Press ISBN 978-1-889322-67-4; Quarmby, K., (2011) Scapegoat: Why We Are Failing Disabled People, , Portobello Books Limited ISBN 978-1-84627-321-6; Sainsbury, C., (2009) Martian in the Playground: Understanding the Schoolchild with Asperger's Syndrome, , SAGE Publications ISBN 978-1-4462-4398-5; Attwood, T., (2006) The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome, pp. 95-111. , Jessica Kingsley Publishers ISBN 978-1-84310-495-7; Kirby, A., (2002) Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap, pp. 106-113. , Souvenir Press ISBN 978-0-285-63512-8; Brookes, G., Dyspraxia (2005) Continuum, pp. 43-46. , ISBN 978-0-8264-7581-7; Four Arrests after Patient Abuse Caught on Film, , UK BBC News (BBC), 2011-06-01, Retrieved 2014-03-01; Berlan, E.D., Corliss, H.L., Field, A.E., Goodman, E., Austin, S.B., Sexual orientation and bullying among adolescents in the growing up today study (2010) Journal of Adolescent Health (Elsevier), 46 (4), pp. 366-371; Dannatt, S.R., Lawful: Paragraph 20 (2008) Values and Standards of the British Army, the British Army, , Retrieved 2013-10-29; Callaghan, J.M., Kernic, F., Chapter 2: ""social psychology"" of the individual soldier (2003) Armed Forces and International Security: Global Trends and Issues, p. 19. , LIT Verlag Münster ISBN 978-3-8258-7227-4; Priesnitz, W., Parental bullying creates bullies Natural Child Magazine, Wendy Priesnitz, , Retrieved 2014-03-01; Bullying: How Parents, Teachers, and Kids Can Take Action to Prevent Bullying, , American Psychological Association; The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying NSPCC, , Retrieved 2014-03-01; The WBI Definition of Workplace Bullying, , Workplace Bullying Institute, Retrieved 2014-03-01; Garbarino, J., Delara, E., And words can hurt forever: How to protect adolescents from bullying (2003) Harassment and Emotional Violence, , Free Press ISBN 978-0-7432-2899-2.

This paper explores how socio-technical transitions can be anticipated and taken into account in strategic transport planning. Techniques to integrate long-term foresight and understanding of socio-technical change in the transport system to support long-term transport policy targets are introduced. The proposed approach extends and combines transport system vision building to analysis of system-level changes on a three-level framework. It presents a novel, policy relevant application in the field of socio-technical transitions. The case is demonstrated with a vision of a safe and secure Finnish transport system in 2100. First, a consistent transport system vision was created with transport experts and authorities using a structured vision building process. Second, key topics involved in the transition from the existing socio-technical system to the envisioned future were analysed using the three-level framework. The demonstration proved successful, and it has contributed to the understanding of importance of the shared long-term perspective in transport system decision-making and strategic planning. It has also generated wider discussion on transport system visions, desired futures paths as well as measures and changes required among the Finnish transport systems stakeholders. © 2014 The Author(s).","Foresight; Socio-technical change; Transport system; Vision","Automotive engineering; Vision; Foresight; Long-term perspective; Socio-technical changes; Socio-technical transitions; Sociotechnical systems; Transport planning; Transport sectors; Transport systems; Transportation",,,,,"Georghiou, L., Keenan, M., Evaluation of national foresight activities: assessing rationale, process and impact (2006) Technol Forecast Soc Chang, 73 (7), pp. 761-777; Da Costa, O., Warnke, P., Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., The impact of foresight on policy-making: insights from the FORLEARN mutual learning process (2008) Tech Anal Strat Manag, 20 (3), pp. 369-387; Weber, M., Kubeczko, K., Kaufmann, A., Grunewald, B., Trade-offs between policy impacts of future-oriented analysis: experiences from the innovation policy foresight and strategy process of the city of Vienna (2009) Tech Anal Strat Manag, 21 (8), pp. 953-969; Könnölä, T., Scapolo, F., Desruelle, P., Mu, R., Foresight tackling societal challenges: impacts and implications on policy-making (2011) Futures, 43 (3), pp. 252-264; Rotmans, J., Kemp, R., van Asselt, M., More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy (2001) Foresight, 3 (1), pp. 15-31; Geels, F.W., Processes and patterns in transitions and system innovations: refining the co-evolutionary multi-level perspective (2005) Technol Forecast Soc Chang, 72 (6), pp. 681-696; de Haan, J.H., Rotmans, J., Patterns in transitions: understanding complex chains of change (2011) Technol Forecast Soc Chang, 78 (1), pp. 90-102; Elzen, B., Wieczorek, A., Transitions towards sustainability through system innovation (2005) Technol Forecast Soc Chang, 72 (6), pp. 651-661; Geels, F.W., From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems: insights about dynamics and change from sociology and institutional theory (2004) Res Policy, 33 (6-7), pp. 897-920; Kivisaari, S., Kokkinen, L., Lehto, J., Saari, E., Management of system innovation in welfare and health sector.

They begin with a qualitative exploration of determining factors, from which a limited range of sets of hypotheses are chosen, producing a-similarly limited-range of scenarios. A mathematical model is then applied which translates the selected hypotheses into input data, in order to quantify the various scenarios identified. Nevertheless, as this article stresses, the increasing complexity of contexts and the possible interplay between the different factors at work in the various fields of study have cast doubt on the appropriateness of this mode of operation. The representativeness of hypotheses selected is no longer any guarantee of the quality of the scenarios deriving from them. This is why, in this article, Guivarch and Rozenberg propose a different way of proceeding, retaining all the determining factors identified in the field of study and running the models hundreds or thousands of times to get as many scenarios as possible from them. Qualitative choices are then made in a second phase, in the ""target- space"" of these scenarios. Guivarch and Rozenberg outline this alternative method here, which consists in building databases of scenarios in order to explore the areas of uncertainty. They also indicate the advantages this represents for foresight studies and present an actual example of the use of this method in the field of climate change economics.",,,,,,,"Le premier bénéfice des politiques dimatiques réside naturellement dans la réduction des dommages du changement climarique; Le taux d'actualisation permet de donner une valeur actuelle à des flux d'argent qui inter-viendront dans le futur NDLR","Guwarch, C.; École des Ponts ParisTech, CIRED (Centre International de Recherche sur l'Environnement et le Dáveloppement)France",,,,,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

The definition of the system in question is often itself a function of multiple stakeholders and is not a fixed object. Boundary critique can be helpful in clarifying the ambiguity, assumptions and the power dynamics around agreeing what the system is that is to be improved and for whose interests. However, there is another dimension of ambiguity which is time. Improvement implies some change from a present condition A to a better future condition B which eventually becomes a new present condition B. Where the environment is about to go through a significant change of pattern (a paradigm shift), the criteria of improvement will be different, depending which paradigm is being considered. For example, energy success in an unrestricted environment can be completely different from energy success in a restricted environment dominated by climate change. In this paper we will introduce the idea of three ways of looking at the future using a method called the three horizons. It will point out three distinct ways of looking at the future, each of which will strongly colour boundary critique and therefore affect what is considered to be a successful or 'improved' system. The foresight framing suggests improvement to sustain the current system, improvement which is a disruptive innovation and may reconfigure the system and improvement which is transformative and may actually result in the collapse of the systems in question.","Boundary critique; Critical systems thinking; Foresight; Systemic intervention; Three horizons; Time","System theory; Boundary critique; Critical systems thinking; Foresight; Systemic intervention; Three horizons; Time; Climate change",,,,,"Beer, S., (1994) Beyond Dispute: The Invention of Team Syntegrity, , Chichester: Wiley; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: An overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), p. 20; Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail., , Cambridge USA: Harvard Business School Press; Churchman, C.W., Operations research as a profession (1970) Management Science, (17); Curry, A., Hodgson, A., Seeing in multiple horizons (2008) Journal of Futures Studies, 13 (1), pp. 1-20; Galvin, R., Science roadmaps (1998) Science, p. 280; Hodgson, A., Appreciating the future (2007) Scenarios for Success, pp. 291-299. , In B.

Early detection of these trends is crucial for deriving successful long-term SC strategies. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic process to support decision makers in assessing future-relevant issues and developing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: In order to contribute to the quality of long-term decision making for SC strategy, we combine strategic issue management (SIM) and corporate foresight methodology. The authors develop a procedure that integrates the Delphi technique and SIM to empirically demonstrate how ""Delphi-based SIM"" can support SC strategy development. Findings: The paper demonstrates how to craft a strategy for consumer goods SCs supported by Delphi-based SIM. The authors are able to include and evaluate uncertain and ambivalent future developments. Pertinent strategic issues for the consumer goods SC include: consumer demographics, automated ordering, city supply, and concept stores. For the reference company, five different strategic paths were created and evaluated. Practical implications: It is challenging for companies to be well prepared for dynamic business environments and to successfully establish a robust SC strategy. The authors develop a systematic Delphi-based SIM for detecting and evaluating signals and integrating them into SC strategy development. Originality/value: To date, a structured approach to integrate uncertain and ambivalent issues into SC strategy development is missing. With SIM and corporate foresight, the authors provide novel methods for strategy development in the consumer goods SC. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer goods industry; Corporate foresight; Delphi method; Strategic issue management; Supply chain strategy",,,,,,"Adamides, E.D., Papachristos, G., Pomonis, N., Critical realism in supply chain research - understanding the dynamics of a seasonal goods supply chain (2012) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 42 (10), pp. 906-930; Adner, R., Helfat, C.E., Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities (2003) Strategic Management Journal, 24 (10), pp. 1011-1025; Akkermans, H.A., Bogerd, P., Yücesan, E., van Wassenhove, L.N., The impact of ERP on supply chain management: Exploratory findings from a European Delphi study (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 146 (2), pp. 284-301; Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (1), pp. 123-148; Anderson, M.H., Nichols, M.L., Information gathering and changes in threat and opportunity perceptions (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44 (3), pp. 367-387; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Ansoff, H.I., Strategic issue management (1980) Strategic Management Journal, 1, pp. 131-148; Barringer, B.R., Bluedorn, A.C., The relationship between corporate entrepreneurship and strategic management (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20 (5), pp. 421-444; Bernon, M., Rossi, S., Cullen, J., Retail reverse logistics: A call and grounding framework for research international (2011) Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 41 (5), pp. 484-510; Bodwell, W., Chermack, T.J., Organizational ambidexterity: Integrating deliberate and emergent strategy with scenario planning (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (2), pp. 193-202; Bottani, E., Rizzi, A., Economical assessment of the impact of RFID technology and EPC system on the fast-moving consumer goods supply chain (2008) International Journal of Production Economics, 112 (2), pp. 548-569; Breuer, P., Sänger, F., Spillecke, D., Deutschland 2020: Worauf es für die Konsumgüterbranche ankommt (2008) Akzente - Deutschland 2020, 3, pp. 9-15; Camillus, J.C., Datta, D.K., Managing strategic issues in a turbulent environment (1991) Long Range Planning, 24 (2), pp. 67-74; Carver, M., Kipley, D., Ansoff's strategic issue management system: A validation for use in the banking industry during high turbulent environments (2010) Business Renaissance Quarterly, 5 (2), pp. 59-76; Chattopadhyay, P., Glick, W.H., Huber, G.P., Organizational actions in response to threats and opportunities (2001) Academy of Management Journal, 44 (5), pp. 937-955; Christopher, M., Holweg, M., 'Supply Chain 2.0': Managing supply chains in the era of turbulence (2011) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 41 (1), pp. 63-82; Corbin, J.M., Strauss, A., Grounded theory research: Procedures, canons, and evaluative criteria (1990) Qualitative Sociology, 13 (1), pp. 3-21; Czaplicka-Kolarz, K., Stanczyk, K., Kapusta, K., Technology foresight for a vision of energy sector development in Poland till 2030.

Employing advanced sciences convergence and analytical methodologies, the aim of this report is to provide a set of plausible solution trajectories to complex scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: Three methodologies are reported here which provide policymakers with plausible solution pathways and alternatives. The methodologies, namely: TechFARM, ADAMS, and NESTTS, involve convergence of scientific disciplines, cutting edge technologies, social dynamics, astute extraction, and principles of foresight to support the process of informed decision-making, as comprehensive tools to develop a plausible solution space and future trends. Findings: The methodologies provided in this report provide scientific basis to trends analysis and foresight. Few selected examples are reported here indicating its practical implications. The methodologies are currently applied to and likely to be used for many applications in trends analysis for government, industry, and even academics. These applications are particularly relevant to policy-making due to their capacity for identification of emerging trends. Originality/value: Being highly adaptable, these methodologies were initially generated for defense applications, but have since been applied to clean water, cyber-security, the medical sector, and environmental health and safety (EHS) and evaluating eco-toxicity of nanomaterials, to strategically address a variety of global challenges. Additionally, these methodologies support investment recommendations and implementation of policies that promise significant benefit to the public at large. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Convergence; Delphi method; Modelling; Nanotechnology; Risk management",,,,,,"Ackoff, A., Towards a system-of-systems concept (1972) Management Science, 17 (11), pp. 661-671; Adlakha-Hutcheon, G., Khaydarov, R., Korenstein, R., Varma, R., Vaseashta, A., Nanomaterials, nanotechnology: Applications, consumer products, and benefits (2009) Environmental Security, Nanomaterials: Risks and Benefits, pp. 195-208. , Linkov, I., Steevens, J.

Ukraine is currently torn between those who favour closer relations with Europe and pro-Russian activists, Crimea having seceded and become part of Russia once again. The sound of marching armies is perhaps not far off, which seems staggering to several generations of Europeans just a century after the outbreak of the First World War. That was a war with enormous consequences for the continent. The retrospective analysis of the political and strategic choices that brought it about is not without interest from the standpoint of foresight studies. Jean-François Drevet homes in here on three elements relating to strategy or forward planning from the outbreak and conduct of the 1914-18 war, which had outcomes that were at variance, to say the least, with what the parties concerned had anticipated. These are the Franco-Russian Alliance, which, though presented as a force for peace, led to a generalization of the conflict; the Schlieffen Plan which, by violating Belgian neutrality, led to a British intervention that was decisive in the defeat of Germany; and the French strategy of all-out attack, which proved very costly in human lives in the age of the machine gun. Such errors of foresight, committed by competent, well-informed personalities persuaded of the rightness of their positions, shouldn't be forgotten, says Jean-François Orevet, particularly in a current context of economic and financial crisis in which the forces of international high finance -the contemporary equivalent in power terms of the early 20th century's armies-regularly flout the warnings and calls for regulation emanating from the rest of society.",,,,,,,"Nin, H.-Y., (2012) Le Plon Schlieffen.

To fill this gap, this paper focuses on the technology planning strategy of organizations that have an interest in developing or adopting wearable interface related technologies. Based on the scenario analysis approach, a technology planning strategy is proposed. In this analysis, thirty wearable interface technologies are classified into six categories, and the importance and risk factors of these categories are then evaluated under two possible scenarios. The main research findings include the discovery that most brain based wearable interface technologies are rated high to medium importance and high risk in all scenarios, and that scenario changes will have less impact on voice based as well as gesture based wearable interface technologies. These results provide a reference for organizations and vendors interested in adopting or developing wearable interface technologies.","Scenario analysis; Strategy; Technology foresight; Wearable interface","Electronic commerce; Information systems; Internet; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risk factors; Scenario analysis; Scenario analysis approach; Strategy; Technology foresight; Technology planning; Wearable interfaces; Wearable technology",,,,,"Alvarez-Santos, V., Iglesias, R., Pardo, X.M., Regueiro, C.V., Canedo-Rodriguez, A., Gesture-based interaction with voice feedback for a tour-guide robot (2013) Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 25 (2), pp. 499-509; Broll, G., Vodicka, E., Boring, S., Exploring multi-user interactions with dynamic NFC-displays (2013) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 9, pp. 242-257; Browne, K., Anand, C., An empirical evaluation of user interfaces for a mobile video game (2012) Entertainment Computing, 3, pp. 1-10; Chleborad, K., Zvara, K., Jr., Dostalova, T., Zvara, K., Hippmann, R., Ivancakova, R., Zvarova, J., Psutka, J., Evaluation of voice-based data entry to an electronic health record system for dentistry (2013) Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, 33 (4), pp. 204-210; Chua, C.L., Koh, K.S., Chong, P.H.J., Shum, P., Tong, Y.C., Wang, X.Y., Zuo, Y.X., Kuek, H.W., Embedded human interface device for voice and data communication (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 Joint Conference of the Fourth International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing, 1, pp. 362-368; Coffey, E.B.J., Brouwer, A.M., Wilschut, E.S., Van Erp, J.B.F., Brain-machine interfaces in space: Using spontaneous rather than intentionally generated brain signals (2010) Acta Astronautica, 67, pp. 1-11; Cuin, Y., Honkala, M., A novel mobile device user interface with integrated social networking services (2013) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 71, pp. 919-932; Iáñez, E., Azorín, J.M., Úbeda, A., Ferrández, J.M., Fernández, E., Mental tasks-based brain-robot interface (2010) Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 58, pp. 1238-1245; Irwin, C.B., Sesto, M.E., Performance and touch characteristics of disabled and non-disabled participants during a reciprocal tapping task using touch screen technology (2012) Applied Ergonomics, 43, pp. 1038-1043; Jowers, I., Prats, M., McKay, A., Garner, S., Evaluating an eye tracking interface for a two-dimensional sketch editor (2013) Computer-Aided Design, 45, pp. 923-936; Kurita, K., Nishikubo, K., Development of a human motion measurement system for application to the human machine interface (2009) Proceedings of 2009 International Joint Conference on ICROS-SICE, pp. 5552-5555; Lee, E.C., Woo, J.C., Kim, J.H., Whang, M., Park, K.R., A brain-computer interface method combined with eye tracking for 3D interaction (2010) Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 190, pp. 289-298; Leeb, R., Perdikis, S., Tonin, L., Biasiucci, A., Tavella, M., Creatura, M., Molina, A., Millán, J.D.R., Transferring brain-computer interfaces beyond the laboratory: Successful application control for motor-disabled users (2013) Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 59, pp. 121-132; Li, Z., Mao, X., Emotional eye movement generation based on Geneva Emotion Wheel for virtual agents (2012) Journal of Visual Languages and Computing, 23, pp. 299-310; Mascarenas, D.D.L., Choi, Y.S., Kim, H.C., Pekedis, M., Hong, S.C., Lee, J.R., Farrar, C.R., Development of a novel human-machine interface exploiting sensor substitution for structural health monitoring (2013) Proceedings of 2013 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, pp. 334-335; Mietzner, D., Reger, G., Advantages and disadvantages of scenario approaches for strategic foresight (2005) Int.

This paper by a foresight study, aims to give an insight and increase awareness about external macro-level future trends concerning raw material consumption and waste generation in production. A limited pilot study indicated that technological forecasting and some reaction upon obvious trends are being taken, although in an ad hoc manner and without structured tools. However, political influences, economic visions and social-cultural shifts were seldom or never discussed. External macro trends and tendencies were examined through PEST analysis to identify potentials and opportunities influencing strategic decisions and innovation initiatives.

The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which can take both target tracking and emission control into account. Based on the foresight optimization, the approximate accuracy reward and the radiation cost, which are derived from the unscented transformation sampling and hidden Markov model (HMM) filter respectively, transform our problem into a tree search problem, and the branch and bound method is used for problem solution. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ©, 2014, Tien Tzu Hsueh Pao/Acta Electronica Sinica.

With the opening of the satellite signal for civilian use, the technology created business opportunities for various applications. Today, satellite positioning technology is used by transporters, carriers, motorists, surveyors, builders, foresters, etc. through a wide array of devices like mobile phones or multimedia devices with built-in receiver modules.Design/methodology/approach–This paper provides the results of a recently held foresight exercise on the future development of Russia’s GLONASS system.Findings–The foresight exercise suggested a number niche markets where the GLONASS technology could be of great use, like monitoring of buildings and construction sides or the monitoring of shipments. In addition, in the case of Russia, large-scale government-driven investment programs will be key drivers for GLONASS’ growth perspectives.Originality/value–The paper provides a comprehensive picture of the development of GNSS for civilian use until 2020. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

Thus, identifying innovation opportunities for these handheld devices is important for academics and practitioners alike. In this study, we proposed a novel method - the Fuzzy NeXT method - for measuring the gaps between users' demands and technological availabilities, as well as possible ways to fill these gaps. To this end, we performed a literature review to identify criteria systems. Then, we evaluated current available products by assessing customer needs and core technologies. Finally we conducted a panel discussion to propose strategies to fill these gaps. The results showed that the Fuzzy NeXT method not only precisely measured the gaps between user demands and technological availabilities, but also stimulated participation and interaction between suppliers and customers. We postulated that this method may trigger additional co-innovation activities and can be useful for many applications, such as corporate foresight and service foresight. © 2014 PICMET.",,"Co-innovation; Core technology; Criteria systems; Customer need; Hand held device; Literature reviews; Panel discussions; User demands; Hand held computers",,,,,"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=243086, IDC, PCs Shipments Forecast. 2013; http://www.tomshardware.com/news/acer-gianfranco-lanci-resign-ceo,12487.html, Further information available at the following link; http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frost-sullivan-smartphoneinnovation-is-slowing-down-As-samsung-struggles-to-differentiate-255130141.html, Further information available at the following link; Kobayashi, S., (2006) A Method That Analyzes Technological Foresight, , in Japanese); Karbo, M., (2005) A Security Portal for Information System Security Professionals, , http://www.snpx.com/cgi-bin/infosyssec.cgi?target=chapter01.htm; Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science, FSTTCS 2009-29th Annual Conference, Proceedings. 2009.

The critical challenge for contemporary urbanism, therefore, is to understand how to develop the knowledge, capacity and capability for public agencies, the private sector and multiple users in city regions systemically to re-engineer their built environment and urban infrastructure in response to climate change and resource constraints. Re-Engineering the City 2020-2050: Urban Foresight and Transition Management (Retrofit 2050) is a major new interdisciplinary project funded under the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council's (EPSRC) Sustainable Urban Environments Programme which seeks to address this challenge. This briefing describes the background and conceptual framing of Retrofit 2050 project, its aims and objectives and research approach.","Sustainability; Town & City planning; Urban Regeneration","Climate change; Energy utilization; Reengineering; Regional planning; Retrofitting; Sustainable development; Critical challenges; Global carbon emission; Interdisciplinary project; Resource Constraint; Sustainable urban environments; Transition management; Urban infrastructure; Urban regeneration; Physical addresses; climate change; economic regeneration; sustainability; town planning; urban renewal",,,,,"Arthur, W.B., (1994) Increasing Returns and Path Dependence In the Economy, , Ann Arbor Press, University of Michigan, USA; Brenner, N., (2004) New State Spaces: Urban Governance and The Rescaling of Statehood, , Oxford University Press, New York, USA; Borup, M., Brown, N., Konrad, K., van Lente, H., The sociology of expectations in science and technology (2006) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 18 (3-4), pp. 285-298; Dalby, S., Anthropocene geopolitics: Globalisation, empire, environment and critique (2007) Geography Compass, 1 (1), pp. 103-118; Eames, M., (2011) Developing Urban Retrofit Scenarios: An Outline Framework For Scenario Foresight and Appraisal, , www.retrofit2050.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/developingscenarios4.pdf, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK, Retrofit 2050 working paper.

This paper presents the modelling of the Irish power system for a one year period at 5. min, 15. min, 30. min and 60. min resolution simulations using a unit commitment and economic dispatch model assuming perfect foresight. The work examines how much operational costs increase with more accurate resolution. Results show that increased temporal resolution captures more variability in system load and renewable generation, and is necessary to capture the inflexibilities of thermal units that lead to more realistic estimations in total generation costs. Significant cycling and ramping of units is also captured in higher resolution modelling that hourly resolution modelling is unable to capture. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Power systems modelling; System flexibility; Unit commitment and economic dispatch; Wind power","Scheduling; Wind power; Economic Dispatch; Higher resolution; Perfect foresights; Renewable generation; System flexibility; Systems modelling; Temporal resolution; Wind generation; Computer simulation; cost-benefit analysis; numerical model; power generation; renewable resource; wind power; Ireland",,,,,"(2010), http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=180, Global Wind Energy Council.

Using trans-disciplinary approaches, this project demonstrates how emergency and foresight planning in five rural Canadian pilot communities can be enhanced through the co-design of a pilot Web 2.0 ""virtual community of practice"" (VCOP). Design/methodology/approach: The VCOP initiative was designed with pilot and field site communities to facilitate knowledge generation and exchange and to enhance community resilience. Building a culturally appropriate disaster resilience process is an iterative ""process of discovery"" and community engagement. Through CBR the project supports practitioners and volunteers to share promising practices and lessons-learned for disaster resilience planning. Findings: The VCOP is being developed in five rural, remote, coastal pilot sites across Canada. Additional field site work is also underway in three urban centres sponsored by a project partner. This paper provides an overview of the initial concept, design and ""proof of concept"" work currently underway. The pilot project will end in the Fall 2012. Research limitations/implications: Inspired by the work of American adult educator Etienne Wenger, the VCOP entails co-design and co-ownership of a knowledge engagement process; one which enables local ""thought leaders"" to participate in emergency planning, preparedness, response and recovery. The VCOP provides a communication platform and fosters ""foresight"" planning and ""education for critical awareness"". Through the sharing of theory and practice, i.e. praxis, communities are mobilized and empowered to anticipate future risks and threats and plan for resilient recovery. Practical implications: The VCOP foresight planning paradigm challenges the status quo design and delivery of emergency management protocols from traditional ""centres of knowledge and power"", e.g. governments and universities and fosters ""bottom-up"" community-driven planning to anticipate risks and threats and help enhance local capacity for resilient disaster recovery. Originality/value: The novel application of a VCOP to disaster emergency planning is in keeping with the spirit and principles of UNISDR's Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015. VCOP has potential to demonstrate disaster resilience ""foresight"" planning as evidenced in the adoption of promising ideas and practices developed by communities, for communities.

These visions were then translated into a strategic and business plan for ICBA.Findings–The research center was successfully able to use foresight methods to develop a long-term strategic plan, continuing its history of innovation in knowledge-based research relating to saline and marginal environments. Novel visions and strategies for water and food futures were developed. A risk assessment of each vision was conducted.Research limitations/implications–This case study presents visions with scenarios and strategic pathways. It illustrates the utility in setting long-term visions first and then linking with strategic plans. Limitations include that the success of such a venture cannot be judged for at least five to six years. While in the short run, resources – human, partnerships, capital and leadership – have been mobilized, it is too soon to gauge real success of the foresight workshop, project.Practical implications–The study shows links between visions, scenarios and strategic pathways. Social implications–The study includes valuable discussions by leading scientists of water and food futures as well as the organizational and leadership capabilities required to deliver alternative futures.Originality/value–One of the few workshop-oriented interventions in the Middle East and North Africa Region (MENA) region using the anticipatory action learning six pillars framework is included.

While a growing body of research has addressed the ecosystem strategies of large enterprises, less attention has been paid to small firms in the role of platform providers. As small firms do not possess the resources of large enterprises, they are not in a position to ignore the importance of immediate returns needed for the viability of the firm. In a case study, we study the entrepreneurial alertness of a small technology-based firm in promoting a platform for machine-to-machine communication. Our results suggest that balancing increasing and immediate returns requires a variety of entrepreneurial activities that encompasses strategic foresight and systemic insight on one hand, and explorative and exploitative actions on the other. This paper contributes to our understanding of platform ecosystems by addressing the strategies of a small firm as an emerging platform provider.","Case study; Entrepreneurial alertness; Platform ecosystems; Small and medium sized enterprises","Information systems; Entrepreneurial activity; Entrepreneurial alertness; Large enterprise; Machine-to-machine communications; Platform ecosystems; Small and medium sized enterprise; Strategic foresight; Technology-based firms; Ecosystems",,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Bockstedt, J.C., Gupta, A., Kauffman, R.J., Technology roles and paths of influence in an ecosystem model of technology evolution (2007) Information Technology and Management, 8 (2), pp. 185-202; Audretsch, D.B., Research issues relating to structure, competition, and performance of small technology-based firms (2001) Small Business Economics, 16 (1), pp. 37-51; Baldwin, C.Y., Woodard, C.J., The architecture of platforms: A unified view (2009) Platforms, Markets and Innovation, pp. 19-44. , (Gawer, A.

Recently, energy use was identified as a major component of economic productivity, along with capital and labor. Other environmental resources and impacts may be nearing environmental thresholds, as indicated by nine planetary environmental boundaries, many of which are linked to energy production and use. Foresight techniques could be applied to guide future actions which include emphasis on (1) energy efficiency to bridge the transition to a renewable energy economy; (2) continued research, development, and assessment of new technologies; (3) improved understanding of environment impacts including natural capital use and degradation; (4) exploration of GDP alternative measures that include both economic production and environmental impacts; and (5) international cooperation and awareness of longer-term opportunities and their associated potential scenarios.

After studying paired associates that varied in difficulty, participants either restudied or were tested on all the pairs (Experiment 1); were tested on only half of the pairs (Experiment 2); or were tested on half of the pairs and restudied the remaining pairs (Experiments 3 and 4). All items were then restudied at participants' own pace before a final cued-recall test. In Experiment 1, interim tests enhanced the effectiveness of subsequent study time and alleviated the foresight bias, whereas interim restudying had no such benefits. Experiments 2, 3, and 4 demonstrated that such test-potentiated self-regulated learning can transfer to non-tested items if restudied intermixed with items that were tested. The results demonstrate yet another practical benefit of testing and suggest that retrieval practice can foster metacognitive sophistication among learners, serving as an experience-based debiasing procedure. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Metacognition; Self-regulated learning; Study-time allocation; Test-potentiated learning; Testing",,,,,,"Anderson, M.C., Rethinking interference theory: Executive control and the mechanisms of forgetting (2003) Journal of Memory and Language, 49, pp. 415-445; Anderson, M.C., Bjork, R.A., Bjork, E.L., Remembering can cause forgetting: Retrieval dynamics in long-term memory (1994) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 20, pp. 1063-1087; Ariel, R., Dunlosky, J., Bailey, H., Agenda-based regulation of study-time allocation: When agendas override item-based monitoring (2009) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 138, pp. 432-447; Arnold, K.M., McDermott, K.B., Test-potentiated learning: Distinguishing between direct and indirect effects of tests (2013) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 39, pp. 940-945; Bahrick, H.P., Hall, L.K., The importance of retrieval failures to long-term retention: A metacognitive explanation of the spacing effect (2005) Journal of Memory and Language, 52, pp. 566-577; Benjamin, A.S., Predicting and postdicting the effects of word frequency on memory (2003) Memory & Cognition, 31, pp. 297-305; Benjamin, A.S., Bjork, R.A., Schwartz, B.L., The mismeasure of memory: When retrieval fluency is misleading as a metamnemonic index (1998) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 127, pp. 55-68; Bertsch, S., Pesta, B.J., Wiscott, R., McDaniel, M.A., The generation effect: A meta-analytic review (2007) Memory & Cognition, 35, pp. 201-210; Bjork, E.L., DeWinstanley, P.A., Storm, B.C., Learning how to learn: Can experiencing the outcome of different encoding strategies enhance subsequent encoding?

We do so by constructing an innovative pattern-oriented individual-based land-use transition model. The model exhibits complex systems behavior by combining simple yet plausible temporal and spatial mechanisms. These operate on cellular automata - abstractions of farmers - and allow automata to maximize utility at varying levels of complexity, rationality, and foresight generated by using Markov chains. By systematically combining mechanisms, we construct different process-based filters generating different emergent behavior and land-use patterns in statistical equilibrium states. Results show that if automata have foresight, emergent behavior can be interpreted as intensification. Furthermore, two different types of intensification can emerge: increasing yield by increasing inputs at constant total agricultural area or increasing yield by substitution of land for inputs. Overall, the results suggest that real-world agricultural land-use systems can be meaningfully approximated by emergent - complex systems - behavior. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","complexity/emergence; entropy/uncertainty; individual-based; land use; pattern formation; self-organization; utility/preference","agricultural land; cellular automaton; complexity; land use change; optimization; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Adams, D., Interpretation of results from CGE models such as GTAP (2005) Journal of Policy Modeling, 27, pp. 941-959; Aspinall, R., Modelling land-use change with generalized linear models-A multi-model analysis of change between 1860 and 2000 in Gallatin Valley, Montana (2004) Journal of Environmental Management, 72, pp. 91-103; Bao Le, Q., Park, S.J., Vlek, P.L.G., Cremers, A.B., Land Use Dynamic Simulator (LUDAS): A multi-agent system model for simulating spatio-temporal dynamics of coupled human-landscape system.

Alexander Thom assessed a few sites (Thom 1967, 1971). Clive Ruggles studied the stone rows in northern Mull, determining approximate declinations using only the stones (Ruggles 1985, Martlew and Ruggles 1993, Ruggles 1999, 112ff.). He also catalogued all of the sites and recorded orientations (Ruggles 1984). The present study assessed 29 of 32 standing stone sites on Mull for possible precise alignments using indicated foresight features. In 1967 Thom published a histogram of some 300 declinations from widely scattered sites (Thom 1967, Fig 8.1). The histogram showed a pattern of peaks that suggested systematic observation of the sun. Thom deduced probable declinations for the peaks. Eleven sites on Mull could not be measured (due to trees, fallen stones, etc.). Three sites were not visited (two had fallen stones). Five others are probably medieval waymarkers. Four sites gave lunar alignments. The remaining nine sites gave multiple solar alignments which strongly supported Thom’s deduced declinations and hence the probable existence of a prehistoric calendar.

The AI trends and scenarios have been elicited using expert Delphi as well as via a simulation of a hybrid discrete-time and discrete-event control system. The system components include a complex information society model, which describes the evolution of social, economic and scientific factors relevant to the production and adsorption of intelligent technologies. The discrete-event component is tailored to model the and science and technology (S&T) development processes in each area under consideration. We specifically investigated the development of intelligent internet technologies, including e-health, e-government and expert systems. Special attention has been paid to decision support systems, digital creativity, and recommenders. Other project work-packages encompass neurocognitive and computer vision systems, as well as quantum and molecular computing.

Experimental studies suggest that anxiety and depression are characterised by distinct future-oriented thinking profiles, and that these profiles are markedly different from those of asymptomatic adults. In this paper, we review these profiles and propose two explanatory models marked by two different neurocognitive systems. The Reconstructive Memory Model emphasises a role for emotionally driven learning and retrieval in episodic foresight (i.e., the construction of future-oriented scenarios), and the Valuation Model proposes that an overweighing of risk and uncertainty estimates can be invoked to explain the future-oriented thought patterns. We consider the effectiveness of interventions aimed at altering such thought patterns. We suggest that future research aimed at elucidating the neurobiological underpinnings of future-oriented thinking in anxiety and depression can play an important role in advancing development of effective biological and psychosocial interventions for these disorders. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Decision-making; Mental time travel; Neuropsychiatry; Neuropsychology; Psychopathology; Treatment","anxiety; biological model; cognition; depression; emotion; episodic memory; futurology; learning; priority journal; reconstructive memory model; review; risk factor; thinking; valuation model; adult; anxiety disorder; depression; human; physiology; psychological model; psychology; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Depressive Disorder; Emotions; Humans; Memory, Episodic; Models, Psychological; Thinking",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Pan, L., Vu, M.-A., Laiser, N., Schacter, D.L., Constructive episodic simulation of the future and the past: Distinct subsystems of a core brain network mediate imagining and remembering (2009) Neuropsychologia, 47, pp. 2222-2238; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Alexander, W.H., Brown, J.W., Medial prefrontal cortex as an action-outcome predictor (2011) Nature Neuroscience, 14, pp. 1338-1344; Alloy, L.B., Ahrens, A.H., Depression and pessimism for the future: Biased use of statistically relevant information in predictions for self versus others (1987) Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 52, pp. 366-378; Anderson, B.A., Laurent, P.A., Yantis, S., Value-driven attentional capture (2011) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108, pp. 10367-10371; Anderson, B.A., Laurent, P.A., Yantis, S., Learned value magnifies salience-based attentional capture (2011) PLoS One, 6, pp. e27926; Anderson, B.A., Yantis, S., Persistence of value-driven attentional capture (2013) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 39 (1), pp. 6-9; Bach, D.R., Dolan, R.J., Knowing how much you don't know: A neural organization of uncertainty estimates (2012) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 13, pp. 572-586; Barrash, J., Tranel, D., Anderson, S.W., Acquired personality disturbances associated with bilateral damage to the ventromedial prefrontal region (2000) Developmental Neuropsychology, 18, pp. 355-381; Bechara, A., Damasio, A.R., Damasio, H., Anderson, S.W., Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex (1994) Cognition, 50 (1-3), pp. 7-15; Bechara, A., Damasio, H., Tranel, D., Damasio, A.R., Deciding advantageously before knowing the advantageous strategy (1997) Science, 275, pp. 1293-1295; Beck, A.T., Brown, G., Steer, R.A., Eidelson, J.I., Riskind, J.H., Differentiating anxiety and depression: A test of the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis (1987) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 96, pp. 179-183; Beck, R., Perkins, T.S., Holder, R., Robbins, M., Gray, M., Allison, S.H., The cognitive and emotional phenomenology of depression and anxiety: Are worry and hopelessness the cognitive correlates of NA and PA?

After sketching the potential crisis of these services in developed countries, we recall the development of a sustainability approach in various European projects, based on the three dimensions of environment, economics, and equity, later supplemented with a fourth axis on governance. Then we present the specific studies which were done in each of these four dimensions during U years: improving demand forecasting models; measure the social impacts of tariff choices; renew the analysis of long term infrastructure management; present a typology of the ongoing territorial re-arrangements. Lastly we present the final part of the research, devoted to a foresight exercise based on eight contrasted scenarios, supporting a series of strategic questions to be raised by concerned authorities. The conclusion stresses the inherent difficulties of such a project in terms of access to reliable data.","Developed countries; Foresight and scenario study; Strategy and development; Sustainability; Urban water services","Research; Water resources; Demand forecasting; Developed countries; European project; Infrastructure managements; Scenario studies; Strategy and development; Sustainable cities; Urban water services; Sustainable development",,,,,"Barbier, J.-M., Dossier évolution des consommations d'eau (2000) TSM Génie Urbain Génie Rural, (2). , dir, ISSN 0299-7258, (février); Barbier, R., Le consommateur d'eau : Esquisse de portrait (2013) Science Eau et Territoires, 10, pp. 28-35. , www.set-revue.fr/le-consommateur-d-eau-esquisse-de-portrait, Disponible sur, (consulté le 28/02/2014); Barel, Y., Prospective et analyse de systèmes (1971) Travaux et Recherches de Prospective, (14), p. 175. , coll.

Although there are some examples of a future orientation, a systematic futures perspective has not been developed. Building on futures studies (including predictive studies on foresight and design and architecture studies), the authors propose a methodological model for future-sensitive practical theology, accounting for the probable, possible, and preferable. The model results in three modes in which practical theology can employ a future orientation: utopian, prognostic-adaptive, and designing-creative. © UV/UFS.","Futures studies; Methodology; Practical theology; Research",,,,,,"Adam, B., Memory of Futures (2004) Krono Scope, 4 (2), pp. 297-315; Beck, U., (1986) Risikogesellschaft.

In the main algorithm each stage of computation requires two proximal steps. One step serves to predict the next point; the other helps to correct the new prediction. At the same time, we present convergence analysis under perfect foresight and imperfect one. In particular, we introduce a stopping criterion which gives rise to Δ -stationary points. Moreover, we apply this algorithm for solving the particular case: variational inequalities. © 2014 Zong-Ke Bao et al.",,,,,,,"Blum, E., Oettli, W., From optimization and variational inequalities to equilibrium problems (1994) The Mathematics Student, 63 (1-4), pp. 123-145. , MR1292380; Giannessi, F., Maugeri, A., (1995) Variational Inequalities and Network Equilibrium Problems, , New York, NY, USA Plenum Press; Giannessi, F., Maugeri, A., Pardalos, P.M., (2001) Equilibrium Problems: Nonsmooth Optimization and Variational Inequality Models, , Dordrecht, The Netherlands Kluwer Academic; Noor, M.A., Oettli, W., On general nonlinear complementarity problems and quasi-equilibria (1994) Le Matematiche, 49 (2), pp. 313-331. , MR1397309 ZBL0839.90124 (1995); Eckstein, J., Nonlinear proximal point algorithms using Bregman functions, with applications to convex programming (1993) Mathematics of Operations Research, 18 (1), pp. 202-226; Glowinski, R., Lions, J.L., Tremolieres, R., (1981) Numerical Analysis of Variational Inequalities, , Amsterdam, The Netherlands North-Holland MR635927; Kinderlehrer, D., Stampacchia, G., (1980) An Introduction to Variational Inequalities and Their Applications, , London, UK Academic Press MR567696; Noor, M.A., Some recent advances in variational inequalities - Part 1: Basic concepts (1997) New Zealand Journal of Mathematics, 26 (1), pp. 53-80. , MR1450808; Noor, M.A., Some recent advances in variational inequalities.

This approach is applied within the French national research project R2D2-2050 (Risk, water resources and sustainable development within the Durance River basin in 2050) to assess both future water availability and the risk of unsatisfied water demands.

Many studies investigate the revenue which could be achieved through arbitrage assuming perfect foresight of electricity prices. In practice, storage operators will not have perfect foresight and will have to devise operational strategies using price forecasts. This paper investigates the impact of forecast accuracy on the optimality of storage revenue. The optimal revenue available is determined using linear programming and historic electricity prices. The results are compared to those found using dynamic programming and electricity price forecasts with increasing percentage error. A small scale lithium ion battery and a large pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) device are compared. The results show that revenue reduces at an increasing rate with increasing forecast error. The PHES device is more sensitive to forecast accuracy than the lithium ion battery. For both technologies, with a maximum error of 30%, 80% of the optimal revenue can be achieved. With increased capacity and significantly increased power rating, the lithium ion battery becomes more sensitive to price forecast accuracy.","Dynamic programming; Electricity storage; Forecast accuracy; Price arbitrage","Costs; Dynamic programming; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric load forecasting; Forecasting; Ions; Linear programming; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Electrical energy storages; Electricity storages; Forecast accuracy; Lithium-ion battery; Operational strategies; Price arbitrage; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Renewable generators; Lithium batteries",,,,,"Strbac, G., Aunedi, M., Pudjianto, D., Djapic, P., Teng, F., Sturt, A., Jackravut, D., Brandon, N., (2012) Strategic Assessment of the Role and Value of Energy Storage Systems in the UK Low Carbon Energy Future, , Energy Futures Lab, Imperial College London, Report for the Carbon Trust; Barbour, E., Wilson, I.A., Bryden, I.G., McGregor, P.G., Mulheran, P.A., Hall, P.J., Towards an objective method to compare energy storage technologies: Development and validation of a model to determine the upper boundary of revenue available from electrical price arbitrage (2012) Energy and Environmental Science, 5, pp. 5425-5436; Grunewald, P., (2012) The Role of Electricity Storage in Low Carbon Energy Systems: Techno-economic Drivers and Transitional Barriers, , PhD Thesis, Imperial College London, Centre for Energy Policy and Technology Faculty of Natural Sciences; Walawalkar, R., Apt, J., Mancini, R., Economics of electric energy storage for energy arbitrage and regulation in new york (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 2558-2568; Sioshansi, R., Denholm, P., Jenkin, T., Weiss, J., Estimating the value of electricity storage in PJM: Arbitrage and some welfare effects (2009) Energy Economics, 31, pp. 269-277; Lund, H., Salgi, G., Elmegaard, B., Andersen, A.N., Optimal operation strategies of compressed air energy storage (CAES) on electricity spot markets with fluctuating prices (2009) Applied Thermal Engineering, 29, pp. 799-806; Connolly, D., Lund, H., Finn, P., Mathiesen, B.V., Leahy, M., Practical operation strategies for pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) utilising electricity price arbitrage (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 4189-4196; Amjady, N., Keynia, F., Day ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a mixed data model and hybrid forecast method (2008) International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, 30 (9), pp. 533-546; Byrne, R.H., Silva-Monroy, C.A., (2012) Estimating the Maximum Potential Revenue for Grid Connected Electricity Storage: Arbitrage and Regulation, , Sandia National Laboratories, Study for the DOE Energy Storage Systems Programme; Bertsekas, D.P., Dynamic programming and stochastic control (1976) Mathematics in Science and Engineering; Ben-Ameur, H., Breton, M., L'Ecuyer, P., Karoui, L., A dynamic programming approach for pricing options embedded in bonds (2007) Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 31, pp. 2212-2233; Lui, C., Song, H., Lawarree, J., Dahlgren, R., New methods for electric energy contract decision making (2000) Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies, International Conference Proceedings, pp. 125-129; Bertsekas, D.P., (1995) Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, 1 (2). , Belmont, MA: Athena Scientific; Market Index Price and Volume, , https://www.elexonportal.co.uk/article/view/188?cachebust=t52ukg8hiq, accessed 22/04/2014; Smarter Network Storage, , http://innovation.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/innovation/en/Projects/tier-2-projects/Smarter-Network-Storage-(SNS)/Project-Documents/Smarter-Network-Strorage-Brochure-Oct+2013.pdf, accessed 22/04/2014; Dinorwig Power Station, , http://www.electricmountain.co.uk/en-GB/Dinorwig, accessed 22/04/2014; Hu, L., Taylor, G., A novel hybrid technique for short-term electricity price forecasting in UK electricity markets (2014) Journal of International Council on Electrical Engineering, 4 (2), pp. 114-120","Harrison, G.P.; Institute for Energy Systems, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Mayfield Road, United Kingdom",,"","Institution of Engineering and Technology","3rd Renewable Power Generation Conference, RPG 2014","24 September 2014 through 25 September 2014",,109231,,,,,"English","IET Conf Publ",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84912068376

The international trend reports, foresight databases, scientific literatures, US patents, R&D investment and human resources databases are linked by this study. Furthermore, each of the developing trends, technologies from international trend reports, foresight databases are categorized into societal demand and technology support respectively. As a result, an overall view of world societal demands will be unveiled, with possible solutions. This article proposes Taiwan as a case study by using, the government R&D investment database, literature & US patent database and human resource database as proxies to reflect the responses and output when facing the challenges in such a rapidly changing world. The solar energy, one of the renewable energy technologies, is adopted as a target in the case to examine the effects of proposed environmental scanning mechanism. The world future energy development will be illustrated from both social demand and technology perspectives, and the hierarchical technology tree of solar energy is further discussed together with Taiwan's R&D input and output. © 2014 PICMET.",,"Database systems; Investments; Patents and inventions; Personnel; Renewable energy resources; Scanning; Solar energy; Developing trend; Environmental scanning; Input and outputs; Renewable energy technologies; Resource database; Scientific literature; Technology support; Technology trees; Environmental technology",,,,,"International Patent Classification (IPC), , http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/, Retrieved 4/15/2014; J-Global, , http://jglobal.jst.go.jp, Retrieved 4/15/2014, (in Japanese); http://www.grb.gov.tw/, STPI-National Applied Research Laboratories Retrieved 4/15/2014, (in Chinese); National Profiles of Human Resources in Science and Technology (NPHRST), , http://hrst.stpi.narl.org.tw/index.htm, Retrieved 4/15/2014, (in Chinese); IPCCAT-Categorization Assistant in the International Patent Classification (Version 2012. 01), , https://www3.wipo.int/ipccat/, Retrieved 4/15/2014","Chan, T.-Y.; STPI, National Applied Research LaboratoriesTaiwan","Kocaoglu D.F.Perman G.Kozanoglu D.C.Daim T.U.Anderson T.R.Niwa K.","City of Kanazawa;et al.;Hitachi;Ishikawa Prefecture;Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI);Toshiba","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2014 Portland International Center for Management of Engineering and Technology, PICMET  2014","27 July 2014 through 31 July 2014",,114779,,9781890843304,,,"English","PICMET - Portland Int.

Particularly in Policy Delphi surveys and related variations that strive to explore opposing views, the diversity of the Delphi panel has been scrutinised. In the majority of earlier Policy Delphi studies, expertise accounted for the most predominant panel selection criterion. However, further surface- and deep-level diversity dimensions discussed in related social science research need to be incorporated for steering diversity in panel selection. In this article, the main effects of surface- and deep-level panel diversity on response behaviour are examined, focussing on extreme response style (ERS). Moreover, interaction phenomena of diversity variables are considered. By conducting a Policy Delphi in real-time format on the future of multimodal mobility, we demonstrate that value attributes significantly influence extreme response behaviour while expertise is especially important in combination with various other diversity variables. Furthermore, we identified a moderating effect of age on the relationship between environmental value characteristics and Delphi panellists' response behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Extreme response style (ERS); Multimodal mobility; Panel diversity; Policy Delphi; Sampling","Sampling; Surveys; Environmental values; Extreme response; Interaction phenomena; Multi-modal; Panel diversity; Process characteristics; Response behaviour; Social science research; Research; Delphi analysis; planning method; policy approach; real time; research work; sampling",,,,,"van der Duin, P., van Oirschot, R., Kotey, H., Vreeling, E., To govern is to foresee: an exploratory study into the relationship between futures research and strategy and policy processes at Dutch ministries (2009) Futures, 41, pp. 607-618; van der Duin, P., den Hartigh, E., Keeping the balance: exploring the link of futures research with innovation and strategy processes (2009) Tech.

On the basis of this theoretical result we propose two simple tests to detect informational deficiency and a procedure to amend a deficient VAR. A simulation based on a DSGE model with fiscal foresight suggests that our method correctly identifies and fixes the informational problem. In an empirical application, we show that a bivariate VAR including unemployment and labor productivity is informationally deficient.

The present paper follows this tradition and describes a prototype of a care robot that is endowed with affective capabilities. The paper describes some of the potential ethical problems arising from such a technology. This aspect of the paper is based on prior research in a European-funded technology foresight project that explored the ethical issues of emerging ICTs. The paper goes beyond the description of technical innovation and its ethical consequences. The recognition of the ethical relevance of research and innovation has spawned a discourse around responsible research and innovation. The paper draws on this discourse, which aims at anticipatory technology governance to ensure the social acceptability and desirability of technologies. The prototype vignette of the paper explores how responsible research and innovation could be realised in practice and how it could be used to address ethical issues such as those of affective care robots. The paper reflects the likely controversies that responsible research and innovation is likely to create and it uses the ethical dilemma of the care robot to draw the reader's attention to possible theoretical and practical conclusions. © 2013 The Authors.","Creative prototyping; Emerging technology; Ethics; ICT; Responsible research and innovation; Robotics","Philosophical aspects; Research; Robotics; Robots; Emerging technologies; Ethical problems; Ethics; ICT; Science fictions; Social acceptability; Technical innovation; Technology foresight; Innovation; ethics; information and communication technology; innovation; research and development; robotics; theoretical study; Europe",,,,,"Collingridge, D., (1981) The Social Control of Technology, , Palgrave Macmillan; Von Schomberg, R., Prospects for Technology Assessment in a framework of responsible research and innovation (2012) Technikfolgen abschätzen lehren: Bildungspotenziale transdisziplinärer Methoden. 2012th ed, , VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, M.

Specifically, we assume that the constraints and preference structures in the (k + 1)st multicriteria optimisation problem depend on the values of criteria in the k-th problem. To make a decision in the initial problem, the decision maker should take into account the anticipated outcomes of each linked future decision problem. This model can be extended to a network of linked decision problems, such that causal relations are defined between the time-ordered nodes. Multiple edges starting from a decision node correspond to different future scenarios of consequences at this node. In addition, we will define the relation of anticipatory feedback, assuming that some decision makers take into account the anticipated future consequences of their decisions described by a network of optimisers-a class of information processing units introduced in this article. Both relations (causal and anticipatory) form a feedback information model, which makes possible a selection of compromise solutions taking into account the anticipated consequences. We provide constructive algorithms to solve discrete multicriteria decision problems that admit the above preference information structure. An illustrative example is presented in Section 4. Various applications of the above model, including the construction of technology foresight scenarios, are discussed in the final section of this article. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.","analysis of consequences; anticipatory systems; causal networks; foresight scenarios; multicriteria decision making","analysis of consequences; Anticipatory systems; Causal network; foresight scenarios; Multi criteria decision making; Algorithms; Data processing; Decision making; Decision theory",,,,,"Beardon, A.F., Candeal, J.C., Herden, G., Induráin, E., Mehta, G.B., The non-existence of a utility function and the structure of non-representable preference relations (2002) Journal of Mathematical Economics, 37, pp. 17-38; Butz, M.V., Sigaud, O., Pezzulo, G., Baldassare, G., Anticipations, brain, individual and social behavior, in anticipatory behavior in adaptive learning systems: From brains to individual and social behavior (2007) Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 4520, pp. 1-18. , ed.

These frictions include search and bargaining problems. We show how, and how many, intermediaries might get involved in a chain, and how bargaining with one depends on upcoming negotiations with those downstream. The roles of buyers, sellers, money, and prices are discussed, allowing us to clarify some neglected connections between different branches of search theory. Pursuing one such connection, with monetary economics, we show how bubbles can emerge in intermediation, even with fully rational agents and perfect foresight. © (2014) by the Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania and the Osaka University Institute of Social and Economic Research Association.",,,,,,,"Admati, A., Pfleiderer, P., Direct and Indirect Sale of Information (1990) Econometrica, 58, pp. 901-928; Aiyagari, R., Wallace, N., Existence of Steady States with Positive Consumption in the Kiyotaki-Wright Model (1991) Review of Economic Studies, 58, pp. 901-916; Aruoba, S.B., Rocheteau, G., Waller, C., Bargaining and the Value of Money (2007) Journal of Monetary Economics, 54, pp. 2636-2655; Beal, V., (2009), http://www.ecommerce-guide.com/article.php/3818976/EBay-Clarifies-Buyer-and-Seller-Protection-Obligations.htm, EBay Clarifies Buyer and Seller Protection Obligations,"" 2009, available at:; Biglaiser, G., Middlemen as Experts (1993) RAND Journal of Economics, 24, pp. 212-223; Binmore, K., (1992) Fun and Games: A Text on Game Theory, , Lexington, MA: D.C.

We present a single linear program (i) whose solution corresponds to the listener's optimal dynamic rule and (ii) whose solution with additional integer constraints corresponds to the optimal static rule. We present a condition-foresight-under which the optimal persuasion problem reduces to the classical maximum flow problem.

After theoretical deliberation, it uses a planned world-wide information system as a case study for applying the notion of granularity regarding economic sectors, time steps, geographic regions and correlations for energy, water, land use and several other drivers of global change. Design/methodology/approach: A planet-wide information system might optimally include areas such as human development indicators, water demand and supply and deforestation issues. A short literature analysis on ""granularity"" shows this concept to have a highly culturally determined and constructivist nature. Findings: The spatial, temporal and sectoral granularity of data presentation strongly impacts conclusions and considerations while looking forward. Hence, granularity issues are of key importance for the question of which megatrends are ultimately discerned as most relevant. Practical implications: These findings may impact the regular report on global megatrends authored by the European Environment Agency, as well as world-wide energy and emission scenarios and technological foresight, such as the ""Global Change Data Base"" as a next step of research. Social implications: In future research, the step from purely quantitative perceptions towards structural perceptions, pattern recognition and understanding of system transitions might be facilitated. The FL statements of larger companies might be diversified, enlarged in scope and use deeper structural understanding. Originality/value: Earlier databases tend to have been focused on one or several single disciplines; the present approach, however, attempts transdisciplinarity and a multiparadigmatic approach. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economy; Energy; Foresight; Forward looking; Future research; Geo-information; Global change; Global change database; Global studies; Granularity; Technology assessment",,,,,,"(2013) Audio English Dictionary, , www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/forward-looking.htm, available at, (accessed 7 September 2013); Abler, J.S., Adams, P.R., Gould, P., (1971) Spatial Organisation.

It reveals hidden basic prerequisites for actual incidents thus providing an information basis for the making efficient decisions. The paper considers the nature, features and possibilities of CLA drawing on the works of French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari who offer the organic metaphor of the rhizome as a way to understand the hybrid and multiple nature of reality. In this relation it argues that CLA is a method of the multiple that offers a process-theory of knowledge that facilitates new becomings and alternative futures. It makes the case that agency and social learning are enhanced through understanding human contexts as layered and dynamic. CLA is an ideal vehicle for articulating this insight and enabling futures practitioners in their work to empower stakeholders to realise their preferred futures. Concepts have effects and therefore can be understood best through application and reflection. CLA's uses can be in the academic sphere as taxonomy or in the applied sphere of process method in which it functions pedagogically as a critical facilitator of libratory consciousness and the social learning. Thus it treats any singular projection of reality with suspicion, instead embracing the plural as the creative inversion of given context. In this way structure becomes flexible and open to transformation whilst agency finds itself located in structure so as to critique and influence it in ways that make it more reflective of optimal current and future possibilities.","Causal layered analysis (CLA); Context; Foresight; Method of the multiple; Rhizome; Stakeholders; Transformation",,,,,,"Anyon, J., (2009) Theory and Educational Research: Toward Critical Social Explanation, , New York: Routledge; Apple, M., (2004) Ideology and Curriculum, , London: Routledge, Falmer; Bussey, M., Critical Spirituality: Neo Humanism as Method (2002) Journal of Futures Studies, 5 (2), pp. 21-35; Bussey, M., Mapping neohumanist futures in education (2006) Neohumanist Educational Futures: Liberating the Pedagogical Intellect, pp. 7-24. , (eds.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on theory from innovation systems and strategic foresight. First, a review of literature was carried out and an innovation systems model of the FM sector was developed. Second, four national workshops were held involving FM practitioners and researchers from Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Third, the results of the workshops were presented and discussed at a Nordic FM conference in August 2011. Finally, an adapted Delphi survey was carried out as a final data collection and validation of the findings. This article has the main focus on the results of the Delphi survey. Findings: The results of the study show that the main issues vary considerably between the four countries, both with regards to megatrends in the strategic environments, the current trends and challenges and the future needs for new competences and knowledge. Despite the large national differences the study is able to identify joint interest across the four countries. Based on the study a common Nordic research agenda is proposed with two headlines: Valuation and professionalization of FM, and Resources and sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The study provides directions for future research with particular focus on the Nordic countries in Europe. Practical implications: The study identifies trends and challenges as well as need for new knowledge and competences for FM practice in each of the four Nordic countries. Originality/value: This is the first comprehensive foresight study aimed at developing a research agenda for FM across the Nordic countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Facilities management; Forecasting; Innovation; Research; Systems analysis",,,,,,"Alexander, K., (2009) European Facilities Management, , www.eurofm.org, The Next Generation, FM Futures, EuroFM Research Project, Centre for Facilities Management (Manchester, UK); Cariola, M., Rolfo, S., Evolution in the rationales of foresight in Europe (2004) Futures, 36 (10), pp. 1063-1075; Dannemand Andersen, P., Rasmussen, B., Jensen, P.A., Future trends and challenges for FM in the Nordic countries (2012) Facilities Management Research in the Nordic Countries - Past, Present and Future, pp. 311-321. , Jensen, P.A., Nielsen, S.B.

Software mobile agents ease this problem by carrying encapsulated code for specific measurement, aggregation and data processing actions. Agent itinerary schemes usually pose agent routing as a variant of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. This leads to significant inefficiencies because built-up data inflate the agent. We propose a hybrid technique, harnessing the nature of wireless transmission, mobile agent features, and data aggregation, to provide the efficiency of traditional response path optimization techniques in mobile agent itineraries. Simulations demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms traditional mobile agent scheduling approaches in wireless sensor networks. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Agent-based approach; Data collection",,,,,"Fok, C.L., Roman, G.C., Lu, C., Agilla: A mobile agent middleware for sensor networks (2009) ACM Trans.

The loss of an ability to control artificial intelligent and autonomous decision systems (AADS) due to their high level of sophistication exceeding human analytic capabilities may be referred to as one aspect of 'singularity'. The latter term is often used to describe potential threats to the mankind coming from the development of AADS that may outperform human intelligence in its most relevant aspects. This paper presents some results of a recent foresight project SCETIST which shed a new light on the above 'singularity' dilemma. The project aimed at building the scenarios and trends of selected advanced information technologies. Based on a classification of AI enabling technologies, two basic scenarios concerning the development of AADS have been built. The first one points out that the newly emerging global expert systems (GES) coupled with the Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) will allow the human societies to explore in full all data streams and knowledge repositories available. The global knowledge from all sources will be further processed by GES so that rational human decisions will not be outperformed by those made by AADS. In the second scenario, the AADS enabling technologies will develop faster than BCI and GES, so that autonomous decision systems can dominate. The third scenario, ranked as least probable, indicates a possibility of slowing down the development of ICT and AI, so that the singularity problem is deferred. The time horizon of the above scenarios was 2030. Finally, we will present the recommendations arising from SCETIST from the point of view of shaping the R&D policies. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","AI Foresight; Anticipatory Networks; Artificial Autonomous Systems; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Global Expert Systems; IT Scenarios","Complex networks; Expert systems; Intelligent systems; Artificial intelligent; Autonomous decision; Autonomous systems; Enabling technologies; Human intelligence; IT Scenarios; Knowledge repository; Singularity problems; Brain computer interface",,,,,"Bostrom, N., When machines outsmart humans (2003) Futures, 35, pp. 759-764; Brunner, P., Bianchi, L., Guger, C., Cincotti, F., Schalk, G., Current trends in hardware and software for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) (2011) J.

In the European Union, robust methodologies are needed to establish effective programmes of measures aimed at achieving the ""good status"" of water bodies according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). These programmes often target the current gap between the actual status of water bodies and the ""good"" status without accounting for uncertainty in water demand. We develop a new methodological framework that enable to account for uncertainty in future water demand and design programmes in order to increase their likelihood of attaining the good quantitative status. The foresight approach enables to construct and quantify future water demand scenarios hand-in-hand with stakeholders during workshops. They consist in identifying drivers, debating pre-constructed scenarios, reconstructing scenarios and estimating water demand. The impact of the co-constructed scenarios is simulated with a resource-demand balance model for all water resources and a cost-effectiveness analysis makes it possible to construct programmes that target the estimated future water deficits at least cost. The methodology is illustrated with an application to Reunion Island (Indian Ocean, France) considering agriculture (Ag) and urban water (Uw) demand. Three combinations of sector scenarios (Uw, Ag) were produced and coherence was eventually ensured by fitting the land use parameter. This solution can accommodate case studies faced with a binding land constraint for housing and agriculture. As each scenario implies significantly different programmes of measure in terms of intensity and spatial distribution, results demonstrate the importance of taking uncertainty on water demand into account. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cost-effectiveness analysis; Foresight; Participation; Reunion Island; Uncertainty; Water management planning","Agriculture; Computer simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Environmental regulations; Landforms; Silver; Water conservation; Water management; Cost effectiveness analysis; Foresight; Management planning; Participation; Reunion Island; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; cost-benefit analysis; design method; European Union; land use; spatial distribution; urban agriculture; water demand; water management; water planning; water resource; Mascarene Islands; Reunion",,,,,"Aulong, S., Bouzit, M., Dörfliger, N., Cost-effectiveness analysis of water management measures in two River Basins of Jordan and Lebanon (2007) Water Resour Manag, 23, pp. 731-753; Babayan, A., Kapelan, Z., Savic, D., Walters, G., Least-cost design of water distribution networks under demand uncertainty (2005) J Water Resour Plan Manag, 131, pp. 375-382; Babel, M.S., Gupta, A.D., Pradhan, P., A multivariate econometric approach for domestic water demand modeling: an application to Kathmandu, Nepal (2007) Water Resour Manag, 21 (3), pp. 573-589; Babel, M.S., Maporn, N., Shinde, V.R., Incorporating future climatic and socioeconomic variables in water demand forecasting: a case study in Bangkok (2014) Water Resour Manag, 28 (7), pp. 1-14; Balana, B.B., Vinten, A., Slee, B., A review on cost-effectiveness analysis of agri-environmental measures related to the EU WFD: Key issues, methods, and applications (2011) Ecol Econ, 70, pp. 1021-1031; Berbel, J., Martin-Ortega, J., Mesa, P., A cost-effectiveness analysis of water-saving measures for the water framework directive: the case of the Guadalquivir River Basin in Southern Spain (2011) Water Resour Manag, 25, pp. 623-624; De Girolamo, A.M., Lo Porto, A., Land use scenario development as a tool for watershed management within the Rio Mannu Basin (2011) Land Use Policy.; Domene, E., Saurí, D., Urbanisation and water consumption: influencing factors in the metropolitan region of Barcelona (2006) Urban Stud, 43 (9), pp. 1605-1623; El Chami, D., Scardigno, A., Malorgio, G., Impacts of combined technical and economic measures on water saving in agriculture under water availability uncertainty (2011) Water Resour Manag, 25, pp. 3911-3929; Frissant, N., (2006) Synthèse des ressources en eau souterraine potentiellement mobilisables à La Réunion, p. 224. , BRGM/RP-55035-FR; Fusillier, J.-L., Feuillade, R., (2010) Un demi-siècle d'irrigation à la Réunion, , http://daf974.agriculture.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/note_de_conjoncture_avril_2010_cle05fc5a.pdf, AGRESTE Reunion. 56 available at; Gober, P., Getting outside the water box: the need for new approaches to water planning and policy (2013) Water Resour Manag, 27 (4), pp. 955-957; Godet, M., Roubelat, F., Creating the future: the use and misuse of scenarios (1996) Long Range Plan, 29 (2), pp. 164-171; Graveline, N., (2010) Prospective de la demande en eau & bilan ressource-demande à l'horizon 2030 à La Réunion, BRGM RP/57771-FR, , http://infoterre.brgm.fr/search/refine.htm, Available at; Graveline, N., Vaudour, K., Aunay, B., (2010) Bilan ressources-demandes en eau à la Réunion, , http://infoterre.brgm.fr/search/refine.htm, BRGM/RP-57770-FR. s, et al.

Design/methodology/approach: An anticipatory action-learning course/workshop with over 50 lecturers and deans framed by the ""six pillars"" futures approach. Methods given the most attention were: the futures triangle; causal layered analysis; and scenario planning. Lecturers deliberated for the first three days, and deans for the last two. After their debates, the lecturers and deans presented their findings and recommendations to each other, and to the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia. As well, they considered how they as individual scholars can also pursue specific actionable steps towards their preferred futures visions. Findings: The recommendations by lecturers and deans can be systematized in the following categories: establishment of a pilot project; enhancement of digital teaching and learning processes; customization of degrees; changing of the culture in higher education; enhancing collaboration; supporting research activities; rethinking of dominant frames of reference; and anticipating upcoming futures trends. Research limitations/implications: As the process included lecturers and deans as key participants, and not, for example, students or the community, stakeholder perspectives are limited. Specific actionable steps, as per recommendations, are being pursued by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, as well as by individual participants. Originality/value: Description of an action learning process in its second year. Year three will continue with a different group of participants who will reflect on the initial findings presented here. Description of the foresight process and findings of this case study may be of value to other ministries of higher education in the region and elsewhere. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Causal layered analysis; Futures triangle; Malaysia; Scenarios; Six pillars; University futures",,,,,,"Azhari, K., The next 50 years for Malaysia: An inquiry using alternative futures methods (2008) Journal of Futures Studies, 13 (2), pp. 43-56; Azhari, K., Transforming public institutions: Some conclusions from applications of scenario planning methods to determine strategic directions (2012) Journal of Futures Studies, 15 (4), pp. 189-202; Brice, J., The virus analogy (2004) Journal of Futures Studies, 9 (2), pp. 77-82; Dewi, M., (2012) Slow but steady growth in foreign branch campuses, , www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20121025152705175, Universityworldnews.com, Issue 245 (28 October), available at (accessed 19 July 2013); (2013) Malaysia Education, , www.educationmalaysia.gov.my/about-us, available at (accessed 19 July 2013); (2012) University of the Future: A thousand year old industry on the cusp of profound change, , www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/University_of_the_future/$FILE/University_of_the_future_2012.pdf, Ernst & Young available at (accessed 19 July 2013); Flaaen, A., Ghani, E., Mishra, S., (2013) How to avoid the middle income trap: Evidence from Malaysia, , http://go.worldbank.org/Y4N79SAQR0, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 6427, 2013, available at (accessed 21 July 2013); Inayatullah, S., Futures visions of Southeast Asia: Some early warning signals (1995) Futures, 2 (6), pp. 681-688; Inayatullah, S., Future avoiders, migrants and natives (2004) Journal of Futures Studies, 9 (2), pp. 83-86; Inayatullah, S., (2004) The Causal Layered Analysis Reader, , (Ed.), Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan; Inayatullah, S., Six pillars: Futures thinking for transformation (2008) Foresight, 10 (1), pp. 4-21; Inayatullah, S., Malaysian universities in transformation (2012) Journal of Futures Studies, 17 (2), pp. 111-124; Inayatullah, S., Futures studies: Theories and methods (2013) There's a Future: Visions for a Better World, pp. 36-66. , Junquera, F.J.

From this grounding discussion, the profiling of national/ social resilience is presented as a useful part of building an improved intelligence process of holistic change forecasting. Next, as a better way of seeing and evaluating how different nations and societies will uniquely respond to crises, uniquely recover post-crisis and thereafter change into their future, a way of using resilience change profiling to improve intelligence foresight and forecasting is detailed. Also, an argument is presented that during periods of financial stress, such an approach has efficacy, economy-of-force and other comparative advantage benefits to Western military organizations. © The Author(s) 2013.","Forecasting; Intelligence; Resilience",,,,,,"Werther, G., (2008) Holistic Integrative Analysis of International Change: A Commentary of Teaching Emerging Futures, 1, pp. 15-24. , note; Werther, G., Profiling Change Processes as a Strategic Analysis Tool (2000) Competitive Intelligence Magazine, 3 (1), pp. 19-22. , note; Mish, F.C., (1989) The New Merriam-Webster Dictionary, pp. 32+439+893+894. , note; Gal, R., Social Resilience in Times of Protracted Crisis: An Israeli Case Study (2011) Inter-University Seminar on Armed forces and Society (IUSAFS) Biennial International Conference, , note; Taleb, N., (2007) The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, , note; Werther, Holistic Integrative Analysis of International Change; Berner, B.K., (2006) Jihad: Bin Laden in His Own Words-Declarations, Interviews, and Speeches, pp. 105+169. , note; note; Taleb, The Black Swan, pp. xxii. , note; (2011) Black Swan Hedge Funds Grow in Popularity, , http://www.hedgefundmarketing.org/black-swan-hedge-funds-grow-inpopularity, note; (2010) What Is a Black Swan Event?, , http://era9000.hubpages.com/hub/What-is-a-Black-Swan-Event, note; Siegal, L., Black Swan or Black Turkey?

Clarke regarded the cosmological argument (in a form that incorporates the ontological argument) as essential to prove the uniqueness, eternity, infinity, and omnipresence of God and the design argument as essential to prove the wisdom and foresight of God. The criticisms Hume makes all depend on his empiricist theory of ideas and his revolutionary theories of causation and causal reasoning. Most of the chapter discusses these themes. The concluding section draws attention to recent research that shows two things. One is how central to Hume’s whole philosophical enterprise is his rejection of theological ideas and doctrines. The other is how this relates to his rejection of certain parts of Newtonian metaphysics. © Oxford University Press 2016.

The computation of risk estimates however is always uncertain, especially if the behavior of traffic participants has to be taken into account. Besides risk estimation, knowledge about the future behavior of other traffic participants can be used for Adaptive Cruise Control Applications, helping to choose a driving strategy with more foresight, which is not only desirable under comfort aspects, but can also be used to reduce fuel consumption. In this publication we focus on highway scenarios, where possible behaviors consist of changes in acceleration and lane-change maneuvers.

It is argued that the orthodox mainstream of economics has provided ideological cover for abstract individualism, for short-term greed, and for the denial of the wider social responsibilities of business and finance. The faith in 'free markets' has been associated with a blindness to power relationships and an indifference to economic inequality. Orthodox economics is congruent with the mythical American Dream. The article draws upon the writings of Norbert Elias to reflect upon economics, and then in turn uses those reflections to raise some questions about Elias's theories, particularly his ideas concerning functional democratization and increasing pressures towards more habitual foresight. © The Author(s) 2014.","democratization; economics; individualism; interdependence; power",,,,,,"Atkinson, A.B., Piketty, T., (2007) Top Incomes over the Twentieth Century: A Contrast Between English-Speaking and European Countries, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Barro, R.J., Stimulus Spending Doesn't Work (2009) Wall Street Journal; The Attribution of Blame as a Means of Orientation (1978) De Gids, 141 (9-10), pp. 638-660. , http://www.norberteliasfoundation.nl/network/essays.php, reprinted in van Benthem van den BerghG., De staat van geweld en andere essays[The State of Violence and Other Essays] (Amsterdam: Meulenhoff, 1980), pp. 7-46; English-language version, 'The Improvement of Human Means of Orientation: Toward Synthesis in the Social Sciences', in R.

In this paper, the roadmapping process is split into different steps in order to analyse which text mining methods could add further value within each. This leads to a two-layered process model, which includes text mining techniques to systematically integrate external information in ongoing roadmapping processes. Textual data can be used for a structured analysis and exploration of thematic fields and an objective, quantitative summary of actual developments. To demonstrate some of the benefits, the field of ""cloud computing"" is used to illustrate the procedure. As this article will show, the results provided by this approach extend the existing methodology, integrates an external view and complements expert opinion. © Imperial College Press.","Data mining; Innovation management; Publication analysis; Roadmapping; Strategic foresight; Strategy development; Technology monitoring; Text mining",,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Imieliński, T., Swami, A., (1993) Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases, pp. 207-216. , ACM SIGMOD Int.

This awareness that mental states and emotions cohere across time-sometimes called mental time travel-is a fundamental component of social cognition critical for assessing risk, making decisions, and understanding others. In this article, I highlight early competencies and development in young children's reasoning about connections among life history, mind, and emotion. I focus primarily on children's knowledge about emotions and decisions caused by being reminded about the past and thinking about the future. Findings reveal surprising insights in children as young as 3-4 years of age, age-related changes through middle childhood into adulthood, and individual differences that have implications for mental health. © 2014 The Society for Research in Child Development.","Emotion understanding; Episodic foresight; Future reasoning; Judgment and decision making; Mental time travel; Social cognition; Theory of mind",,,,,,"Altshuler, J.L., Ruble, D.N., Developmental changes in children's awareness of strategies for coping with uncontrollable stress (1989) Child Development, 60, pp. 1337-1349; Amsterlaw, J., Lagattuta, K.H., Meltzoff, A.N., Young children's reasoning about the effects of emotional and physiological states on academic performance (2009) Child Development, 80, pp. 115-133. , doi:10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01249.x; Bamford, C., Lagattuta, K.H., A new look at children's understanding of mind and emotion: The case of prayer (2010) Developmental Psychology, 46, pp. 78-92. , doi:10.1037/a0016694; Bamford, C., Lagattuta, K.H., Looking on the bright side: Children's knowledge about the benefits of positive versus negative thinking (2012) Child Development, 83, pp. 667-682. , doi:10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01706.x; Beck, A.T., Rush, A.J., Shaw, B.F., Emery, G., (1979) Cognitive therapy of depression, , New York, NY: Guilford Press; Charman, T., Ruffman, T., Clements, W., Is there a gender difference in false belief development?

The work of the Ministry of Defence is not only to anticipate risks and threats, but also to contribute to the improvement of technological and industrial capabilities both in defence and the dual use arena.

Data for innovation management and policy must be valid, reliable, relevant and actionable.Design and approach–The paper examines trends within finance, environment and institutions and society, all with regard to innovation and technology. It examines how these trends interact with each other and with measurement of innovation and socio-technical change.Findings–In the future, measurement for innovation policy must occur in markedly different ways – and on quite different scales – than is currently the practice. The paper concludes with a future-oriented list of items to be measured, with preliminary guidelines on how to organize to measure them.Research limitations/implications–Foresight researchers must put new emphasis on measurement.Practical implications–Local and national statistical agencies will have to measure new indicators and organize differently to measure them.Social implications–Voters may be eager to embrace principles and goals, though they fail to find excitement in the more tedious issues of measurement. It is incumbent on us to pay more attention to measurement, to resist governments’ and lobbyists’ efforts to introduce special-interest bias into public statistics, and to carry the story to the public of the importance of measurement. Much of the policy change that is now needed is needed because of past and current harmful human behaviors. Nicholas Sarkozy (Press 2011) concisely stated the rationale for this paper: “We will not change our behavior unless we change the ways we measure”.Originality/value–This concept paper goes beyond other indexes and proposals to identify new phenomena that must be measured. In contrast to other works which are oriented to measurement-push (toward policy), the present paper makes bold assertions about the trends needing to be addressed by policy, then proposes measurement based on policy-pull. It argues against premature worldwide statistical standards, and for Popperian “multiple engineering experiments”.

What happened in the meantime? The E-mail has become somewhat outdated, obsolete and less used by the new generations of young people. Television is in danger due to the improved technology, and the new generations made out of young people and not only, who whant to be more and more up to date with the news, to communicate and enjoy games and movies online rather than on TV. What does this trend have to do with business? A lot, because as I wrote a year ago about Generations Y and IY, which work differently than their predecessors, the technology of information and communications constantly creates a wide working platform. As it’s usually said in business “Sky’s the limit”, regarding the idea of unlimited possibilities for business development, new information and communications technology creates the premises of an unimaginable boom of services of all kinds and in all areas, not just in the business field, but also in the social, education and culture, health, art and sport field, etc. During the communist period, but also in the post-communist one, Romania, as well as the Eastern European countries, suffered from the lack of services in general, but the tremendous progress of computer science in the last decade and the growing number of young and innovative people in this field, in Romania in particular, are an important premise for developing such services at a level we couldn’t dream of 15-20 years ago. It remains to be confirmed in the coming years this foresight and and to track the speed of this development. © 2014, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

Thus, solidarity initiatives to promote short food supply chains, through which the consumer wants to be a ""consum'actor"", tend to develop. This is the context where the AMAP (Association for the maintenance of peasant farming - a french version of CSA), which are intended to carry ""solidarity"" values, and turned towards an ""authentic"" and ""safe"" agriculture, spread in. Marginal phenomenon or awakening of civic consciousness, we should question about the emergence of these new practices and those who are their actors. These behaviors are even more interesting to decrypt at a time when rural areas, including the most isolated, are in particular recomposed under the effect of the arrival, in large part, of a population coming from urban space. The present contribution questions about the favorable contexts and conditions for these social and solidarity projects. Does the French countryside have the potential for the growth and sustainability of these projects? To answer these questions, we propose a methodological tool that is a first step to validate the relevance of indicators linked to the presence of AMAP. In a second step, these indicators are used to construct an index for evaluating the potential of emergence of AMAP inside the french rural areas. These indicators relate on one side to the agricultural context and, on the other side, to the demographic, social, economic and associative contexts. The adopted spatial unit of reference is the living-basin. The obtained results show consequent disparities that reflect the differentiated socio-spatial dynamics in rural areas. They also highlight the endogenous character of the potential of these territories, claimed and exploited by local actors in the processes of recomposition actually underway.","AMAP (french CSA); Consum'actor; Living-basin; Rural area; Territorial foresight","consumption behavior; peasant agriculture; rural area; rural economy; sustainability; sustainable development; France",,,,,"(2001) Statuts D'Alliance Provence Réseau Régional des AMAP, 7p. , Alliance Provence; Bessy-Pietri, P., Sicamois, Y., Le zonage en aires urbaines en 1999 (2001) INSEE Première, (765), 4p; Bitoun, P., (2009) Qui Sont les Consommateurs-citoyens de l'AMAP Bio en Brenne, 12p. , enquête INRA-MONA; Bitoun, P., Carmillet, C., Lefebvre, C., (2009) Qui Sont les Consommateurs-citoyens de l'AMAP Terre de Mer, Enquête INRA-MONA/ESA, 15p. , Angers; Chalopin, M., (2007) Avantage Compétitif des AMAP pour les Producteurs Agricoles?, 61p. , HEC Paris, Observatoire du Management Alternatif; Chambon, L., (2010) Profil Social des Consommateurs en AMAP, 74p. , Université du Maine; David-Leroy, M., Girou, S., AMAP Association pour le maintien d'une agriculture paysanne (2009) Replaçons L'alimentation Au Cœur de Nos Socié tés, 152p. , Éditions Dangles; Douence, H., (2009) Enquête Auprès des Consommateurs et des Producteurs des AMAP du Béam, 61p. , Données FD CIVAM 64/relais AMAP Béarn, Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; Rural development in the european union.

Not that the facts reported or the assumptions put forward were entirely unpredictable or unknown; but they prompted the experts, followed by the various audiences to whom the results were presented, to consider the actions to be undertaken from a different point of view, primarily in relation to the type of future wished for—or not—in the decades to come. The value of baseline scenarios is not that they predict a sure future—which no one can actually anticipate as far ahead as 2050—but that they define the narrow path of possible futures that are likely to unfold if we fail to broaden our options now. Alternative scenario(s) can thus be mobilised to identify the objectives that we need to set when broadening the options explored.

In the face of oncoming consumer society, the program aimed at developing in children new habits and a sense of foresight. Besides, by contributing to school savings accounts, children would become familiarized with bank operations. The issue of children’s savings spurred debates, conflicts, and negotiations between families and authorities, even between school principals and the SEP itself. This program clearly conveys government efforts regarding not only the private lives of families and their relations with money, but also new money-related feelings and practices. Children, parents, schools, and government become subjects immersed in a broad spectrum of new monetary relations. © 2014, Colegio de Mexico, A.C., Departamento de Publicaciones.

In this paper, we propose agent-based computational modeling as a tool for studying the evolution of generativity, and offer a set of building blocks for constructing agent-based models in which generativity evolves. We describe a series of models that we have created using these building blocks, and summarize the results of our computational experiments to date. We find in several different settings that key features of generative systems can themselves evolve endogenously, including ""core"" components and reusable parts. Moreover, we find that boundedly rational designers without coordination or foresight can evolve business ecosystems that satisfy a diverse range of consumer preferences and exhibit robustness to changes in these preferences over time.","Complexity theory; Digital business ecosystems; Innovation; Platform design; Simulation and modeling IS","Computational methods; Ecology; Ecosystems; Information systems; Innovation; Complexity theory; Computational experiment; Computational model; Consumer preferences; Digital business ecosystems; Platform design; Simulation and modeling IS; Sociotechnical systems; Structural design",,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Bockstedt, J.C., Gupta, A., Kauffman, R.J., Making sense of technology trends in the information technology landscape: A design science approach (2008) MIS Quarterly, 32 (4), pp. 779-809; Altenberg, L., Evolving better representations through selective genome growth (1994) Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation, IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence, 1, pp. 182-187. , Orlando, FL; Arthur, W.B., (2009) The Nature of Technology: What It is and How It Evolves, , New York: Free Press; Axelrod, R., Advancing the art of simulation in the social sciences (1997) Simulating Social Phenomena, pp. 21-40. , R.

In particular, Donella Meadows' ""twelve places to intervene"" (Meadows 1999) have been used as the basis of creating a tool to this end. Meadows' 12 places can be broadly grouped into three categories: (1) physical features, (2) information and controls and (3) ideas. Using these three categories, this article analyses a number of examples of social policy related to Indigenous disadvantage in Australia. The actions and goals of different policies are analysed via this tool, with a view to illuminating what could be expected by way of impact from these policy initiatives. The overall aim is to understand if systems thinking in particular, and foresight approaches in general, can be useful in contributing to more impactful, or at least more honest, social policy in the face of ever growing complexity.","Indigenous; Leverage points; Meadows; Places to intervene; Social policy; Systems thinking; Wicked problems",,,,,,"Ahmed, N.M., (2010) A user's guide to the crisis of civilisation: and how to save it, , London: Pluto; Altman, J.C., (2007) Forty Years On: political transformation and sustainability since the referendum and into the future, , Paper presented at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Conference, 7 November 2007, Canberra, Australia; (2010) Strategic Review of Indigenous Expenditure February 2010, , Department of Finance and Deregulation, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra; (2011) Office of the Coordinator General for Remote Indigenous Services, six monthly report - April-Sept 2011, , Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra; (2007) Tackling wicked problems, a public policy perspective, , Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra; Banks, G., (2009) Challenges of evidence-based policy, , Australian Public Service Commission, Productivity Commission, Canberra; (2007) From hand out to hand up: Cape York Welfare Reform Project, 2. , Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership, Cape York, Queensland; Cape York Welfare Reform, Cape York Partnerships (2008), http://www.capeyorkpartnerships.com/cape-york-welfare-reform, Retrieved on April 15, 2013, from; Colebatch, H.K., (2006) Beyond the policy cycle: the policy process in Australia.

Furthermore we set the scenarios in a broader context of new modes of mobility. The power of scenarios consists in the ability to challenge dominating paradigms.

His awareness of an irreversible crisis in municipal civilization is thought to have led him to engage under a highly ""modern"" regime in intellectual activity that was still interlaced with high civil ideals. The author, instead, believes that this decision was the most evident factor in a deeply-felt rethinking of his own intellectual activity, which began around 1348 and culminated in the works of his maturity. A deliberate contrast can be noted with the centuries-old traditional thinking in respect of the social nature of man and it would have a profound influence on Humanism, characterized by significant pressure in the direction of disengagement from any civil involvement.

Several theories propose that EpF is related to theory of mind (ToM) and executive function (EF). However, these links have not been tested using standard behavioral tasks in young children. Accordingly, we administered a battery of EpF, ToM, and EF tasks to 90 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds. After controlling for age and language ability, the EpF tasks were not intercorrelated, nor were they individually related to EF or ToM. As such, this study challenges the claim that EpF, at least as currently assessed in young children, is related to their developing ToM and EF abilities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Development; Executive function; Future thinking; Preschoolers; Theory of mind","age; child development; child psychology; executive function; female; forecasting; human; male; neuropsychological test; preschool child; short term memory; theory of mind; thinking; Age Factors; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Executive Function; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychology, Child; Theory of Mind; Thinking",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Atance, C.M., Future thinking in young children (2008) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17, pp. 295-298; Atance, C.M., Jackson, L.K., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102, pp. 379-391; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5, pp. 533-539; Buckner, R.L., Carroll, D.C., Self-projection and the brain (2007) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, pp. 49-57; Busby, J., Suddendorf, T., Recalling yesterday and predicting tomorrow (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 362-372; Busby Grant, J., Suddendorf, T., Preschoolers begin to differentiate the times of events from throughout the lifespan (2009) European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 6, pp. 746-762; Carlson, S.M., Developmentally sensitive measures of executive function in preschool children (2005) Developmental Neuropsychology, 28, pp. 595-616; Carlson, S.M., Moses, L.J., Individual differences in inhibitory control and children's theory of mind (2001) Child Development, 72, pp. 1032-1053; Carlson, S.M., Moses, L.J., Breton, C., How specific is the relation between executive functioning and theory of mind?

Motivated by his foresight, this special issue aims to encourage research that explicitly combines ideas from different disciplines, with a view to creating new integrative theories with greater explanatory power than those based on a single discipline. Five articles selected from a pool of 60 submissions are presented in the special issue, each with its own distinctive interdisciplinary contribution to expanding our knowledge about an important IB phenomenon. In editing the special issue, the editors developed a new understanding of the opportunities and challenges in conducting interdisciplinary research. These insights are reported in the current editorial essay. We conclude by discussing four approaches to interdisciplinary inquiry observed across the five accepted papers: (1) addressing a new phenomenon, (2) asking a fresh question, (3) finding a better answer and (4) contributing to a base discipline. © 2014 Academy of International Business.","bridging between disciplines; integrative theorizing; interdisciplinary research; multilevel analysis; new research directions; new theory development",,,,,,"Birkinshaw, J., Brannen, M.Y., Tung, R., From a distance and generalizable to up close and grounded: Reclaiming a place for qualitative methods in international business research (2011) Journal of International Business Studies, 42 (5), pp. 573-581; Buckley, P.J., Lessard, D.R., Regaining the edge for international business research (2005) Journal of International Business Studies, 36 (6), pp. 595-599; Cantwell, J., Brannen, M.Y., Positioning JIBS as an interdisciplinary journal (2011) Journal of International Business Studies, 42 (1), pp. 1-9; Cheng, J.L.C., Henisz, W., Roth, K., Swaminathan, A., Advancing interdisciplinary research in the field of international business: Prospects, issues, and challenges (2009) Journal of International Business Studies, 40 (7), pp. 1070-1074; Cheng, J.L.C., Guo, W., Skousen, B., Advancing new theory development in the field of international management: Contributing factors, investigative approach, and proposed topics (2011) Management International Review, 51 (6), pp. 787-802; Daniels, J., Relevance in international business research: A need for more linkages (1991) Journal of International Business Studies, 22 (2), pp. 177-186; Dunning, J.H., Toward an eclectic theory of international production: Some empirical tests (1980) Journal of International Business Studies, 11 (1), pp. 9-31; Dunning, J.H., The theory of international production (1988) International Trade Journal, 3 (1), pp. 21-66; Dunning, J.H., The study of international business: A plea for a more interdisciplinary approach (1989) Journal of International Business Studies, 20 (3), pp. 411-436; Kogut, B., Joint ventures: Theoretical and empirical perspectives (1988) Strategic Management Journal, 9 (4), pp. 319-332; North, D., (1990) Institutions, institutional change and economic performance, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Rugman, A.M., Verbeke, A., Nguyen, Q.T.K., Fifty years of international business theory and beyond (2011) Management International Review, 51 (6), pp. 755-786; Simon, H.A., (1945) Administrative behavior, , New York: Free Press","Cheng, J.L.C.; Australian School of Business, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; email: joecheng@unsw.edu.au",,,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",,,,,00472506,,,,"English","J.

The results of network analysis indicate a dynamic but fragmented PHS innovation landscape in Europe.

The personal traits of the owners/managers are deemed to be the key factors to the business success of housing development firms. This paper examined the main determinants of successful businesses in the housing development sector under the lens of psychological traits of the owners/managers. To identify the success factors of housing development firms, interviews were conducted on 10 housing developers in Peninsular Malaysia. The study shows the significant psychological traits that distinguish the business success of housing developers compared with those in the existing literature. These factors are (1) high confidence and ambition, (2) vision and foresight, (3) industriousness, (4) perseverance and (5) integrity. As housing development is a risky industry, developers can use these findings as a guideline in managing their business toward superior performance.","Business success; Housing developers; Psychological traits",,,,,,"Fine, S., Meng, H., Feldman, G., Nevo, B., 'Psychological predictors of successful entrepreneurship in China: An empirical study' (2012) International Journal of Management, 29 (1), pp. 279-292; Finkelstein, S., Hambrick, D.C., (1996) Strategic Leadership: Top Executives and Their Effects On Organizations, , West Publishing, St Paul, MN; Gibb, K., Hoesli, M., 'Developments in urban housing and property markets' (2003) Urban Studies, 40 (5-6), pp. 887-896; Glancey, K., Greig, M., Pettigrew, M., 'Entrepreneurial dynamics in small business service firms' (1998) International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour & Research, 4 (3), pp. 249-268; Gomelsky, N., Simmons-Cohen, D., Czamansky, D., (1995) Entrepreneurial Theory and Practice: Immigrant Opportunities, , The Neaman Institute, Haifa; Gundry, L.K., Harold, P.W., 'The ambitious entrepreneur: High growth strategies of women-owned businesses' (2001) Journal of Business Venturing, 16, pp. 453-470; Gupta, V., Macmillan, I.C., Surie, G., 'Entrepreneurial leadership: Developing and measuring a cross-cultural construct' (2004) Journal of Business Venturing, 19 (2), pp. 241-260; Hayward, M.L.A., Shepherd, D.A., Griffin, D.W., 'A hubris theory of entrepreneurship' (2006) Management Science, 52, pp. 160-172; Hicks, S.R.C., 'What business ethics can learn from entrepreneurship' (2009) The Journal of Private Enterprise, 24 (2), pp. 49-57; Hind, P., Wilson, A., Lenssen, G., 'Developing leaders for sustainable business' (2009) Corporate Governance, 9 (1), pp. 7-20; Hornaday, J.A., Aboud, J., 'Characteristics of successful entrepreneurs' (1971) Personnel Psychology, 24 (2), pp. 141-153; Hui, S.K.F., Csete, J., Raftery, J., 'Factors involved in the success of Hong Kong construction and property entrepreneurs' (2006) International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour & Research, 12 (4), pp. 228-245; Hutchings, M.D., Christofferson, J.P., 'Factors leading to construction company success: Perceptions of small-volume residential contractors' (2005) International Journal of Construction Education and Research, 1 (2), pp. 102-111; Ibrahim, A.B., Soufani, K., 'Entrepreneurship education and training in Canada: A critical assessment' (2002) Education and Training, 44 (8-9), pp. 421-430; Irjayanti, M., Azis, A.M., 'Success factors of fast moving goods of small medium enterprises in Indonesia' (2013) Journal of Global Entrepreneurship, 4 (1), pp. 17-30; Jaafar, M., Abdul-Aziz, A.R., Ali, R., 'Entrepreneurial characteristics of indigenous housing developers: The case of Malaysia' (2009) Economia.

One in-depth case study reports a series of ten tactile images created for the Pompidou Centre (France). Details on how information from the original paintings are interpreted, translated, and embodied into tactile representations are the focus of this work. In this way, highlights are provided on an alternative way (through touch) of understanding two-dimensional art. Insights resulting from this work reveal intentions behind the tactile representation of paintings, how these are transformed to transmit messages, and how lessons learned from this project can aid in guiding the creation of better and more effective tactile representations. This work reveals that communicating information translated from sight to touch is an extremely complex process and needs to be approached with deep foresight and attention to detail. © 2013 Project MUSE.",,,,,,,"Paterson, M., (2007) The Sense of Touch: Haptics, Affects and Technologies, , (London: Bloomsbury); Classen, C., A feel for the world: Lessons in aesthetics from the blind (1998) The Color of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imagination, pp. 138-160. , (New York: Routledge); Hinton, R., Use of tactile pictures to communicate the work of visual artists to blind people (1991) Journal of Visual Impairment and Blindness, 85 (4), pp. 174-175; Bentzen, B.L., Tactile graphic displays in the education of blind persons (1982) Tactual Representations: A Sourcebook, pp. 389-390. , ed.

There is however an important issue that the machinery of classical Bayesianism is ill equipped to deal with, that of ""unknown unknowns"" or, in the cases in which they are actualised, what are sometimes called ""Black Swans"". This issue is closely related to the problems of constructing an appropriate state space under conditions of deficient foresight about what the future might hold, and our aim is to develop a theory and some of the practicalities of state space elaboration that addresses these problems. Building on ideas originally put forward by Bacon (1620), we show how our approach can be used to build and explore the state space, how it may reduce the extent to which organisations are blindsided by Black Swans, and how it ameliorates various well-known cognitive biases. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Black swans; Cognitive biases; Inductive methods; Organisational and management decision-making; State space construction; Unknown unknowns",,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., (1995) Cognitive psychology and its implications, , W.H.

These divergent points of view fall along a continuum from anthropocentric to biocentric values, but most conservationists are relatively closer to each other than to the ends of the spectrum. We have some concerns with both positions but emphasize that conservation for both people and all other species will be most effective if conservationists focus on articulating the values they all share, being respectful of divergent values, and collaborating on common interests. The conservation arena is large enough to accommodate many people and organizations whose diverse values lead them to different niches that can, with good will and foresight, be far more complementary than competitive. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.","Anthropocentric; Biocentric; Ecosystem services; Extinction; Meta-analysis; Values","conservation planning; ecosystem service; niche; welfare provision; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; philosophy; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Philosophy",,,,,"Burgman, M., Lindenmayer, D., (1998) Conservation biology for the Australian environment, , Surrey Beatty and Sons, Chipping Norton, New South Wales; Cafaro, P., Primack, R., Species extinction is a great moral wrong (2014) Biological Conservation, 170, pp. 1-2; Callicott, J.B., Whither conservation ethics?

Once these specifications are provided, the flights must proceed along their routes with such speed profiles that every pair of aircraft complies with the minimal separation requirement imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration. The task of separation assurance is most challenging in terminal airspace, with many routes merging and crossing. This paper contributes a mathematical model and an algorithmic approach for routing flights strategically, with a foresight that potentially helps the subsequent computation of speed profiles compliant with the separation requirements and with each aircraft's feasible speed range. The approach consists of reducing a general routing problem to the shortest-path problem. © 2012 by Data Fusion& Neural Networks.",,"Air transportation; Mathematical models; Separation; Specifications; Algorithmic approach; Federal Aviation Administration; Flight navigation; General routing problem; Separation assurances; Shortest path problem; Terminal airspace; Transportation system; Aircraft",,,,,"Isaacson, D.R., Sadovsky, A.V., Davis, D., Scheduling for precision air traffic operations: Problem definition and review of prior research NASA, , (to be published); Papadimitriou, C.H., Steiglitz, K., (1998) Combinatorial Optimization; Algorithms and Complexity, , Dover, New York, Sec.

The paper suggests that the introduction in the field of S&T and innovation policy of a tool commonly used in engineering fields aimed at identifying and measuring all possible failures of a proposed technology. Instead of focusing on the magnitude of promises, it suggests that a useful perspective can be gained by placing systematic attention to the negative side, i.e. all reasons why a given technology may fail to deliver the promises.

The analysis focuses on the energy intensity of the GDP, and is modeled on conservative, innovative and accelerated scenarios for long-term socio-economic development in the Russian Federation until the year 2030. The article studies the practical application of modern technological foresight using the examples of two priority areas for the development of science, technology and equipment in the Russian Federation. The two examples used are ‘effective environmental management’ and ‘energy efficiency and conservation’. We examine a list of national critical technologies that correspond to these priority areas in the aspects of long-term scientific, technological, socio-economic prognosis, and fiscal policies to stimulate corporate expenditures on research and development. Then, we evaluate the guidelines for Russian ecological development policies in the period until 2030. The guidelines are aimed at solving socio-economic problems by providing low-carbon solutions for sustainable development, as well as the preservation of the environment, biodiversity, natural resources, and the realization of every person’s right to a clean environment. A comparative analysis has been performed on ‘effective environmental management’ as well as ‘energy efficiency and conservation’, which are designated as national priorities of the Russian Federation, and ‘green technology’, a priority of international centers of scientific and technological development. Finally, conclusions were drawn about the potential impact of the mass use of energy-efficient technologies to reduce the anthropogenic load on the environment by reducing energy intensity, as well as about improving the ecological situation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants. The approaches to the development of recommendations for the implementation of general provisions for the ‘Russian Climate Doctrine’ in part increase energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, and also decrease market disproportions by implementing financial and fiscal policy measures which stimulate the reduction of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. © SGEM2014.","Climate Doctrine of the Russian Federation; Ecological development policies; National critical technologies; Strategic planning; Technological foresight","Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecology; Economics; Energy policy; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Problem solving; Remote sensing; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Critical technologies; Ecological development; Energy efficiency and conservations; Energy efficient technology; Russian federation; Socio-economic development; Technological development; Technological foresight; Energy efficiency",,,,,"Bobylev, S., Perelet, R., (2013) Ustoichivoe Razvitie V Rossii [Sustainable Development in Russia], p. 220. , (Ed.), Berlin and Saint Petersburg, Russko-Nemetskoe Byuro Ecologicheskoi Informatsii; http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/Energy-economics/Energy-Outlook/Energy_Outlook_2035_booklet.pdf, British Petroleum, 2014.

It aims to show that Walzer is mistaken in reserving this concept, as well as the associated notion of dirty hands, for situations in which political communities, in a desperate struggle for survival, cannot help but kill innocents intentionally, rather than merely with foresight. If moral agents have moral reasons to proceed in a way which will foreseeably result in innocent people being killed, they are already facing a supreme emergency; the killing does not need to be intentional in some narrower sense for that to be the case. This article stays agnostic on whether or not war can be morally justified in principle, and also on whether or not a dirty hands conception of war is ultimately defensible. It merely argues that if there are supreme emergencies as Walzer describes them, then situations in which war can justifiably be waged are, and ought to be, such emergencies. © The Author(s) 2013.","Collateral damage; Dirty hands; Just war theory; Michael Walzer; Supreme emergency",,,,,,"Art, R., Betts, R.K., Copeland, D.C., (2002) War with Iraq is Not in America’s National Interest, , New York Times, 26 September; Bennett, J., Morality and consequences (1981) The Tanner Lectures on Human Values, 2, pp. 46-116. , McMurrin S (ed.), Salt Lake City, UT: University of Utah Press; Coates, A.J., (1997) The Ethics of War, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Gowans, C.W., (1994) Innocence Lost: An Examination of Inescapable Moral Wrongdoing, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Lefkowitz, D., Collateral damage (2008) War: Essays in Moral Philosophy, pp. 145-164. , May L (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Lichtenberg, J., War, innocence, and the doctrine of double effect (1994) Philosophical Studies, 74 (3), pp. 347-368; Luban, D., The romance of the nation-state (1980) Philosophy & Public Affairs, 9 (4), pp. 392-397; McIntyre, A., Doing away with double effect (2001) Ethics, 111 (2), pp. 219-255; McMahan, J., (2009) Killing in War, , Oxford: Clarendon Press; Nardin, T., (1983) Law, Morality and the Relations of States, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Orend, B., (2006) The Morality of War, , Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press; Scanlon, T., (2008) Moral Dimensions: Permissibility, Meaning, Blame, , Cambridge; London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; Steinhoff, U., (2007) On the Ethics of War and Terrorism, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Steinhoff, U., Debate: Jeff McMahan on the moral equality of combatants (2008) Journal of Political Philosophy, 14 (4), pp. 220-226; Toner, C., Just war and the supreme emergency exemption (2005) Philosophical Quarterly, 55 (221), pp. 545-561; Toner, C., The logical structure of just war theory (2010) The Journal of Ethics, 14 (2), pp. 81-102; Walzer, M., Political action: The problem of dirty hands (1973) Philosophy & Public Affairs, 2 (2), pp. 160-180; Walzer, M., (2004) Arguing about War Yale.

But studies indicate that numbers of social, technological, economic, environmental and political factors are also hindering the sector's development. Accordingly, the objective of the paper is to analyse the renewable energy technologies on non-technical grounds. The analysis was conducted in four phases. First expert selection, second a list of renewable energy technologies were shortlisted, third initial list of technologies were prioritized based on two variables, and finally key renewable energy technologies were selected. The results indicate that wind and biomass based electricity generation are the two promising renewable energy technologies.

Local, regional and national systems differ in how they are designed to organize effective participation and create innovative ideas for missions, goals, strategies and actions. They also differ in how they build the effective coalitions needed to adopt, guide and protect strategies and actions during implementation, and how to build competence and knowledge to sustain implementation. This book presents the strategic foundations for government’s role in fostering and adapting to societal transformation in a volatile world. It shifts the focus of the discipline from an overtly retrospective analysis to a prospective analysis, incorporating the role of foresight techniques and instruments. Above all, it stimulates debate about the practical implications of governance as an emergent future-oriented framework of public management.

This appraisal is done employing a tridimensional framework: hindsight, insight and foresight perspectives. We argue for the reconfiguration of language education aimed at functional plurilingualism for the Nigerian child.

It reviews the likely demand and supply pressures on the food system, and the pressing requirements to improve sustainability and address the needs of the world's poorest. It argues that the food system is entering a period of radical change, led particularly by growth in demand, which requires action on food production, diet, waste and efficiency, and governance. A key challenge on the supply side is sustainable intensification - producing more from the same amount of land with fewer and less profound negative effects on the environment. Increasing the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer application will be critical for increasing yields while reducing the many major environmental consequences of leaching and run-off. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,"alternative agriculture; demand-side management; food availability; food consumption; food market; global perspective; sustainability; United Kingdom",,,,,"Abbott, P., Borot De Battisti, A., Recent global food price shocks: Causes, consequences and lessons for African governments and donors (2011) Journal of African Economies, 20, pp. I12-I62; Anderson, K., Globalization's effects on world agricultural trade, 1960-2050 (2010) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 365, pp. 3007-3021; Bateman, I.J., Mace, G.M., Fezzi, C., Atkinson, G., Turner, K., Economic analysis for ecosystem service assessments (2011) Environmental and Resource Economics, 48, pp. 177-218; Burney, J.A., Davis, S.J., Lobell, D.B., Greenhouse gas mitigation by agricultural intensification (2010) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, pp. 12052-12057; Conway, G., (2012) One Billion Hungry, Can We Feed the World, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Dawson, C.J., Hilton, J., Fertiliser availability in a resource-limited world: Production and recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus (2011) Food Policy, 36, pp. S14-S22; Day, W., Engineering advances for input reduction and systems management to meet the challenges of global food and farming futures (2011) Journal of Agricultural Science, Cambridge, 149, pp. 55-61; Dorward, A., Getting real about food prices (2011) Development Policy Review, 29, pp. 647-664; Dorward, A., Chirwa, E., The Malawi agricultural input subsidy programme: 2005/06 to 2008/09 (2011) International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability, 9, pp. 232-247; Dunwell, J.M., Crop biotechnology: Prospects and opportunities (2011) Journal of Agricultural Science, Cambridge, 149, pp. 17-27; Evenson, R.E., Gollin, D., Assessing the impact of the Green Revolution, 1960 to 2000 (2003) Science, 300, pp. 758-762; Foresight, (2011) The Future of Food and Farming: Challenges and Choices for Global Sustainability.

Whilst emphasising the role of the asymmetry volatility model in portfolio formation, we also investigate the economic implication of the smooth transition exponential smoothing (STES) method in portfolio risk management. Our results suggest that all portfolios perform better in the ex-post period compared to the ex-ante period. However, investors may not be able to obtain any benefits from diversifying their portfolio in developed stock markets in both ex-ante and ex-post periods. Further investigation on the economic implications of the STES method also show that the STES method does help to cushion losses generated from the international diversification portfolio. Hence, this suggests the use of the STES method in computing and monitoring the risk of an internationally diversified portfolio. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.","Asymmetry volatility model; Ex-ante; Ex-post; International portfolio diversification (IPD) benefits; Smooth transition exponential smoothing (STES)",,,,,,"Akgiray, V., Conditional heteroskedasticity in time series of stock returns (1989) Journal of Business, 62 (1), pp. 55-80; Aslanidis, N., Osborn, D.R., Sensier, M., Co-movements between US and UK stock prices: The role of time-varying conditional correlations (2009) International Journal of Finance and Economics, 15 (4), pp. 366-380; Bartram, S.M., Bodnar, G.M., No place to hide: The global crisis in equity markets in 2008/2009 (2009) Journal of International Money and Finance, 28 (8), pp. 1-47; Berger, D., Pukthuanthong, K., Yang, J.J., International diversification with frontier markets (2011) Journal of Financial Economics, 101 (1), pp. 227-242; Bonfiglioli, A., Favero, C.A., Explaining co-movements between stock markets: The case of US and Germany (2005) Journal of International Money and Finance, 24 (8), pp. 1299-1316; Bugár, G., Maurer, R., International equity portfolios and currency hedging: The viewpoint of German and Hungarian investors (2002) Astin Bulletin, 32 (1), pp. 171-197; Campbell, R., Koedijk, K., Kofman, P., Increased correlation in bear markets (2002) Financial Analysts Journal, 58 (1), pp. 87-94; Chiou, P.W., Benefits of international diversification with invetsment constraints: An over-time perspective (2009) Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 19 (2), pp. 93-110; Chiou, P.W., Lee, A.C., Chang, C.C., Do investors still benefit from international diversification with investment constraints?

The technological process has resulted in the reduction of labor without content and the expansion of labor with higher qualification or schooling, a phenomenon that can be discussed by turning to Keynes and Marx. As far as Keynes is concerned, his foresight was that technological progress would generate a huge reduction of labor time and the expansion of leisure time. Since this did not occur, the failure may be attributed to the fact of having worked with opposition between labor without content and leisure. Thus, it was not possible to capture the historical changes in labor and man’s relationship with it. Marx’s viewpoint is completely different, because his opposition takes place between labor without content and ""activity labor"", the latter impregnated with content and essential to the development of individualities. Therefore, present reality has a greater identification with Marx and presents major challenges to capitalism and its critique. © 2014 Universidade Federal da Bahia.

In this paper, I formulate and defend an answer to two questions that have not yet been discussed in the literature on exculpatory ignorance. First, which kinds of propositional attitudes that count as ignorance provide an excuse? I argue that we need to consider four options here: having a false belief, suspending judgement on a true proposition, being deeply ignorant of a truth, and having a true belief that falls short of knowledge. Secondly, ignorance of which propositions counts as an excuse? I discuss four candidates: ignorance of one's obligation, ignorance that one is able to meet that obligation, ignorance of how to meet that obligation, and lack of foresight regarding that obligation. I argue that we can give a satisfactory account of exculpatory ignorance only if we pay attention to these two neglected issues. © 2014 The Author 2014.

It focuses on studies of 'advisory domains' (more or less distinct traditions for assessment of technologies, such as risk analysis, foresight and ethical assessments). The purpose of the study was to increase the understanding of current assessments in order to identify whether more integrated approaches were needed. We present an analytic approach for studying assessments across advisory domains and present findings from our analytic studies, showing differences in methodological characteristics across the domains. We discuss how the domains partially overlap and identify gaps. We show how most of the selected assessments address technology trajectories and science, technology and innovation policies, and few address specific applications. Finally, we argue that quality control is important for the legitimacy of advice on emerging science and technologies and that the domains are important in this respect. © The Author 2014.

Knowledge-based techniques and methods reinforce health assessment and influence on predictive maintenance of structures. A concept of the knowledge-based approach is developed. In particular, toolboxes for a simple numerical 3-degree of freedom (dof)-model and for force reconstruction at Canton Tower are implemented, respectively. The case studies deepen the insight into identifying needs in the field of SHM to employ knowledge-based approaches, especially in the reasoning process. The proposed concept lays the ground for future research in the field of SHM for utilizing knowledge-based methods in correlation with SHM algorithms and analysis of feedbacks obtained from sensors, engineering expertise and users former experience. The foresight is to broaden the scope for applying Knowledge Management (KM) techniques and methods towards developing a decision-making component for supporting SHM systems, and in turn fostering the detection, localization, classification, assessment and prediction. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Force reconstruction; Integration; Knowledge management; Knowledge-based systems; Reasoning process; Structural health monitoring","Case based reasoning; Correlation methods; Decision making; Integration; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Engineering expertise; Force reconstruction; Integration of knowledge; Knowledge-based approach; Knowledge-based methods; Predictive maintenance; Reasoning process; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Structural health monitoring",,,,,"Giurgiutiu, V., (2007) Structural Health Monitoring with Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors, , Elsevier, New York; Balageas, D., Fritzen, C.P., Gü emes, A., (2006) Structural Health Monitoring, , ISTE Ltd., London; Worden, K., Dulieu-Barton, J.M., An overview of intelligent fault detection in systems and structures (2004) Struct.

Specifically, the Drexel research team is exploring the development of a comprehensive maintenance and management plan for movable bridges. This includes the transformation of state of the art inspection protocols that leverage expert knowledge, past events and existing standards, manuals and recommendations. Drexel researchers are also investigating Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) strategies and their potential implementation on robotic platforms for automated assessment and evaluation of infrastructures to augment the inspection process. Thanks to the foresight of a regional infrastructure owner in the Greater Philadelphia Area, the described initiatives are allowing the rigorous implementation of technology on real, complex systems. Furthermore, many of these research efforts will be integrated into existing courses at Drexel University where students will be exposed to real life living infrastructures.

Significant time and money was spent designing out parts from subassemblies and requalifying subassemblies on severely compressed schedules to resolve problems and resume production. The solution adopted is a proactive obsolescence management information system that provides more options and more foresight to handle obsolescence issues before production or customers are impacted. It allows the company to predict and load level obsolescence work. And it significantly reduces product lifecycle costs and time spent on critical obsolescence issues. This paper highlights obsolescence problems observed, outlines the subsequent investigation, summarizes the proposed solution, and reviews subsequent process and system problems found during implementation that had to be addressed. The aims of this paper are to highlight the obsolescence problem and subsequent lessons learned from improving processes that involve obsolescence. These lessons learned can be applied to other companies who want to reduce life cycle costs caused by obsolescence. This can also be applied to other process improvement activities that stretch across multiple departments.",,"Cost reduction; Information management; Management information systems; Obsolescence; Lifecycle costs; Load levels; Obsolescence management; Process Improvement; Product-life-cycle; Time spent; Life cycle",,,,,,"Golemme, S.; FMC Technologies Schilling Robotics, 201 Cousteau Pl, United States",,"","IPC - Association Connecting Electronics Industries","IPC APEX EXPO 2014: New Ideas...

In the late 1970 s, modern control theory and optimization technique were introduced into the field of thickness control in earnest and they greatly contributed to the quantitative expansion of the domestic steel industry. As the examples, the AGC gain by optimum regulator theory and thickness and inter stands tension control system by multivariable control technique are shown. After the 90 s, the high added value and function improvements of the control system become more and more important for steel industry including the thickness control and they were indispensable for manufacturing of the high-strength steel. Here, the mill balance control for the tandem cold mill and the highly precise rolling load model by Genetic Programming are explained. As future problems, it is mentioned that practical use of the operation know-how is important and the development of the operation support system using them is significant.","AGC; Genetic programming; Mill balance control; Modern control theory; Operation know-how; Thickness control","Cold rolling; Control theory; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Steelmaking; Technology transfer; Thickness control; AGC; Mill balance control; Modern control theory; Multivariable control; Operation know-how; Operation support system; Optimization techniques; Tension control systems; High strength steel",,,,,"Tsuda, K., (2000) J.

Once a symbol of technological competition between opposing political systems, space activities have become a part of everyday life and an indispensable means for states to achieve economic, scientific, political and social goals. This Report addresses the space activities of Turkey, a latecomer to space challenge but a country rapidly progressing in this field. In this context, major space-related policies and projects are first discussed. The current status of the Turkish space industry is then defined through SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats). The analysis is informed by a May 2012 workshop was held in Turkey at the Defense Sciences Institute, which brought together a range of interested actors to discuss Turkey's space policy. The workshop was followed up six months later with a survey of a larger group of participants. This Report lays out the findings of these two events, articulating the strengths and weaknesses for Turkey's space aspirations, and also a proposal for the country's future space ambitions. Strategies and policies that will be supportive in achieving the proposed space vision are also introduced. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Developing country; Space vision; Strategic management; SWOT analysis",,,,,,"Özalp, T., Space as a strategic vision for Turkey and its people (2009) Space Policy, 25, pp. 224-235; (1993) 2nd SCST meeting, Turkish science and technology policy: 1993-2003, , TÜBI˙TAK, Ankara; (2003) Vision 2023 project: Defense, Avionics and Space Industry Panel Report, , TÜBI˙TAK, Ankara; (2005) 11th SCST Meeting, Report on the Assessments of Developments, , TÜBI˙TAK, Ankara; (2005) National Space Research Programme: 2005-2014.

Yet, anticipating the right requirements to meet the future market needs is a very difficult task that requires abili-ties to precisely understand problems and make robust decisions without knowing the future. In the aviation industry, long product lifecycles make this task even more vital for a successful product policy on the one hand, but also more challenging on the other hand. This paper demonstrates how scenario planning techniques can be applied to support the requirements elici-tation phase under uncertainty when developing new products by portraying the methodical ap-proach and obtained results of a recently com-pleted foresight study. The thematic focus was on the future potential role of automation in civil air transport with a time horizon until 2050. Three alternative future scenarios were developed, forming the basis of a detailed analysis of the fu-ture traveler's characteristics and needs in order to derive high-level requirements for more auto-mated air travel operating processes.","Product development; Requirements elicitation; Scenario planning","Civil aviation; Aviation industry; Operating process; Operational requirements; Product development process; Requirements elicitation; Robust decisions; Scenario Planning; Scenario-based; Product development",,,,,"Reichmuth, J., Ehmer, H., Berster, P., Bischoff, G., Grimme, W., Grunewald, E., (2008) Topical Report: Analyses of the European Air Transport Market.

It is increasingly affected by climate change impacts, energy policies, advances in new technologies, the increasing role of services and societal and political interests, moving towards low carbon bioeconomies or green economy. The current state of the European forest-based sector can be labeled as one of creative destruction. The examples of destructive trends are the declining demand for communication paper products, a long lasting economic fall in the EU and its many impacts and the move of some forest industry investment into increasingly fast, growing markets in Asia, or low cost production regions like South America. The European forest products' markets must reassess the long-term outlook of the European forest-based sector in the face of the structural changes. This should also utilize systematic foresight methods to tackle developments for which we do not have the possibility to use the traditional data based models. They must design the policies and strategies for a sector so it will be more diversified and cross-sectorial than today.",,"Climate change; Commerce; Economics; Investments; Climate change impact; Communication papers; Creative destruction; Data based model; Declining demand; European forests; Growing markets; Political interest; Forestry; Energy; Market Research; Planning",,,,,,,,,"European Forest Institute",,,,,12367850,,EFNEF,,"English","EFI News",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910636404

Box 41014, Lubbock, TX  79409, United States","The optimality of the long-run capital-income tax rate is revisited in a simple neoclassical growth model with credit frictions. Firms pay their factors of production in advance, which requires borrowing at the beginning of the period. Borrowing, in turn, is constrained by the value of collateral that they own at the beginning of the period, leading to inefficiently low amounts of capital and labor. In this environment, the optimal capital-income tax in the steady state is non zero. Specifically, the quantitative analyses show that the capital-income tax is negative and, therefore, the distortions stemming from the credit friction are offset by subsidizing capital. However, when the government cannot distinguish between capital-income and profits, the capital-income tax is positive as the government levies the same tax rate on both sources of income. These results stand in contrast to the celebrated result of zero capital-income taxation of Judd (Judd, K. 1985. ""Redistributive Taxation in a Simple Perfect Foresight Model.""

This theme is pursued here with the aid of some examples from my own work on catalysis (the speeding up of the attainment of chemical equilibria), as well as from the work of others. The emergence of the maser (forerunner of the laser), the development of positron emission tomography, and the creation of blood-glucose sensors for use by those suffering from type 2 diabetes are among the innovations adumbrated here. In addition to describing the unpredictable nature of much scientific discovery, I also describe areas in which new chemical technology will be especially beneficial to society. I foresee that openstructure solid catalysts are likely to transform many of the ways in which chemicals, now manufactured in an environmentally harmful manner, will be produced in the future. Also outlined is the vital need to understand and exploit photocatalysts so as to harness solar energy.

Responsibility for the promotion of high-end learners is in the hands of the cantonal boards of education, and depends largely on their current professional understanding and educational-political foresight, as well as on the political volition and priorities of the school authorities. Within this diversity, there are schools with excellent concepts and successful implementations regarding gifted education, while other schools have a poor understanding of individualisation and potential-oriented learning. The present article summarises the philosophy and key aspects of a contemporary realisation of local- or regional-based integrated gifted education that is related to supplementary arrangements for special needs.

The network structure of the new entrant SC would be designed under the limited production capacity of its producers in a way to maximize its future capturable profit in the competitive markets. The network of the new SC is assumed to be set ""once and for all"" but further price and service level adjustments are possible. Outer part of this bi-level model deals with strategic decisions of SC network design. Given the SC network structure assigned by the outer model in each iteration, the inner equilibrium model determines the equilibrium retail prices and service levels. Finally, we illustrate the model through several numerical examples. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper exploits the SFP and crowdsourcing methodologies and presents ""crime-sourcing"", a prototype designed to explore futuristic crowdsourcing ideas. Its purpose is to provide a fictional scenario that speculates how crowdsourcing could be blended with future technology to develop a ""crime-to-conviction"" model. This scenario takes the cyber-space concept of crowdsourcing and then transfers it to a hybrid cyber/physical business model context. The story aligns itself with Zuckerman's doctrine that while there is human tendency to ""flock together"" in crowds, most of our social ties, online or offline, are only with a small set of people with whom we have much in common. The paper concludes with a discussion on contribution of this paper to crowdsourcing theory and the challenges that need to be overcome if prototyping is to become an established foresight methodology. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Business models; Crime-sourcing; Crowdsourcing; Social change; Technological forecasting","Technological forecasting; Big datum; Business models; Crime-sourcing; Crowdsourcing; Social changes; Crime; methodology; strategic approach; theoretical study; World Wide Web",,,,,"Johnson, B.D., (2011) Science Fiction Prototyping: Designing the Future with SF.

Our model is based on the observation that even if users prefer application variety, applications often also exhibit direct network effects. When there are direct network effects, users prefer to consume the same applications to benefit from consumption complementarities. We show that the combination of preference for variety and consumption complementarities gives rise to (i) a commons problem (to better satisfy their individual preference for variety, users have an incentive to consume more applications than the number that maximizes joint utility); (ii) an equilibrium selection problem (consumption complementarities often lead to multiple equilibria, which result in different utility levels for the users); and (iii) a coordination problem (lacking perfect foresight, it is unlikely that users will end up buying the same set of applications). The analysis shows that the platform can resolve these problems and create value by limiting the number of applications available. By limiting choice, the platform may create new equilibria (including the allocation that maximizes users' utility); eliminate equilibria that give lower utility to the users; and reduce the severity of the coordination problem faced by users. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"Armstrong, M., Competition in Two-Sided Markets (2006) Rand Journal of Economics, 37, pp. 668-691; Arthur, B.W., Positive Feedbacks in the Economy (1990) Scientific American, 262, pp. 92-99; Brandenburger, A., Power play (A): Nintendo in 8-Bit Video Games (1995) Harvard Business School Case and Teaching Note, , 795-102, 795-167; Caillaud, B., Jullien, B., Competing cybermediaries (2001) European Economic Review, 45, pp. 797-808; Caillaud, B., Jullien, B., Chicken & Egg: Competition Among Intermediation Service Providers (2003) RAND Journal of Economics, 34, pp. 309-328; Cantillon, E., Yin, P.-L., Competition Between Exchanges: Lessons from the Battle of the Bund (2010), MIT Working Paper; Cantillon, E., Yin, P.-L., Competition Between Exchanges: A Research Agenda (2011) International Journal of Industrial Organization, 29, pp. 329-336; Casadesus-Masanell, R., Campbell, N., Betfair vs. the UK Bookmakers (2008) Harvard Business School Case and Teaching Note, , 709-417, 709-418; Casadesus-Masanell, R., Hałaburda, H., When Does a Platform Create Value by Limiting choice?

To reach this objective, we have implemented an ABM of livestock producers facing drought conditions in Uruguay. The first step consists in implementing a standard ABM with pasture growth, herd dynamics and simple agents roughly imitating farmers' strategies. The second step is more participative since it consists in assessing the model with the real cattle farmers. As with most modelling processes, this evaluation phase requires feedback on model design. In order to make this assessment more lively and efficient, we have conceived a tool for drawing diagrams that can be immediately interpreted by the agents. Thanks to this new editor, the actors have quickly understood how the model worked and were able to criticize and modify it. Thus, this innovative modelling tool enables the involvement of stakeholders in co-designing ABM for participatory foresight studies. We hope it will facilitate the emergence of new and more efficient practices for farm management that can account for climate changes. © JASSS.","Activity Diagram Interpretation; Collaborative Modeling; Executable UML; Livestock; Participative Modeling; Rangeland Management",,,,,,"Abt, C.C., (1970) Serious games, , New York: Viking Press; Alcaras, J.-R., Lacroux, F., (1994) Planifier c'est s'adapter, , (No. GRASCE-NR--94-03-FR_1996:300): CNRS; Ammarguellat, Z., A Control-Flow Normalization Algorithm and Its Complexity (1992) Software Engineering, 18 (3), pp. 237-251; Anderson, M., McCartney, R., (1995) Inter-diagrammatic reasoning, , Paper presented at the IJCAI (1); Badler, N.I., Virtual humans for animation, ergonomics, and simulation (1997) Nonrigid and Articulated Motion Workshop, , (16 Jun 1997).

Due to the growing recognition of the role of human performance engineering in many dierent areas (e.g., clinical medicine, industrial design, etc.) and the resulting increase in requirements of the methods involved, having the “right tool for the job” is becoming of vital importance. Soware developers bear the brunt of the responsibility of determining the qualities of a soware application that dene it as being “the right tool” for a specic job. In contrast, users of this class of tools must determine when their application extends a given tool beyond its intended scope. ese abilities require a knowledge base spanning a number of dierent fundamental concepts and methods encompassing not only the obvious aspects of human performance and computer programming, but also many other less obvious issues related to database requirements, parameter standards, systems engineering principles, and soware architecture. In addition, foresight of how specic components can best be integrated to t the needs of a particular usage is also necessary. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Knowledge based systems; Medicine; Product design; Clinical medicine; Engineering principles; Fundamental concepts; Human performance; Knowledge base; Computer systems programming",,,,,"Allard, P., Stokes, I.A.F., Blanchi, J.P., (1994) Three-Dimensional Analysis of Human Movement, , Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL; Badler, N.I., Task-oriented animation of human figures (1989) Applications of Human Performance Models to System Design, , G.R.

By establishing the technology and processes involved in using ochre, one can determine the skill, knowledge and cognitive abilities required to execute those activities. This is done here by constructing thought-and-action and inferential cognitive sequences for the various ochre activities performed at Sibudu, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Powder production alone is not an indicator of complex cognitive processes, although some planning, foresight and knowledge of materials is required. Some ochre powder was used in the creation of hafting adhesives which is a cognitively demanding process requiring attention-switching, response inhibition, analogical reasoning and abstract thought. The direct transfer of ochre powder from an ochre piece to a soft material through grinding and rubbing requires some complex thought and action procedures - analogical reasoning and the ability to multi-task and switch attention between activities. Scoring a piece of ochre with a sharp tool does not necessitate enhanced executive functioning. However, some engravings demonstrate intentionality and an awareness of space and symmetry that may imply abstract thought. © 2014 The McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.",,,,,,,"Allain, J., Rigaud, A., Décor et function: Quelques exemles tirés du Magdalénien (1986) L'Anthropologie, 90, pp. 713-738; Amati, D., Shallice, T., On the emergence of modern humans (2007) Cognition, 103, pp. 358-385; Ambrose, S.H., Chronology of the Later Stone Age and food production in East Africa (1998) Journal of Archaeological Science, 25, pp. 377-392; Ambrose, S.H., Paleolithic technology and human evolution (2001) Science, 291, pp. 1748-1753; Ando, J., Ono, Y., Wright, M., Genetic structure of spatial and verbal workingmemory (2001) Behavior Genetics, 31, pp. 615-624; Avery, G., Cruz-Uribe, K., Goldberg, P., Grine, F.E., Klein, R.G., Lenardi, M.J., The 1992-1993 excavations at the Die Kelders Middle and Later Stone Age cave site, South Africa (1997) Journal of Field Archaeology, 24 (3), pp. 263-291; Baddeley, A.D., The episodic buffer: A new component of working memory?

Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand","On the delay-of-gratification choice paradigm, 4-year-olds typically choose the larger, delayed reward, exhibiting delay of gratification, whereas 3-year-olds typically choose the small, immediate reward. Despite this highly replicated finding, the cognitive mechanism(s) underlying 3-year-olds' failure on the choice paradigm remain unclear. Recently, several researchers have proposed the involvement of the ""hot"" affective system and the ""cool"" cognitive system in pre-schoolers' performance on the choice paradigm. Using this ""hot"" and ""cool"" systems framework, we tested 112 3- and 4-year-olds on a modified choice paradigm that was designed to help young children better utilize their ""cool"" system, allowing them to make more mindful and future-oriented decisions. In the modified paradigm, 3-year-olds made choices consistent with those of 4-year-olds, exhibiting delay of gratification. These findings have important implications for previous theoretical accounts of 3-year-old children's failure to delay gratification. Additionally, they highlight the critical role that the method plays in young children's performance on cognitive paradigms. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Choice paradigm; Delay of gratification; Episodic foresight; Future-oriented decision making; Hot/cool systems; Pre-schoolers","child development; delay discounting; female; human; male; physiology; preschool child; reward; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Delay Discounting; Female; Humans; Male; Reward",,,,,"Addessi, E., Bellagamba, F., Delfino, A., De Petrillo, F., Focaroli, V., Macchitella, L., Paglieri, F., Waiting by mistake: Symbolic representation of rewards modulates intertemporal choice in capuchin monkeys, preschool children and adult humans (2014) Cognition, 130, pp. 428-441. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2013.11.019; Atance, C.M., Jackson, L.K., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102, pp. 379-391; Ayduk, O., Mendoza-Denton, R., Mischel, W., Downey, G., Peake, P.K., Rodriguez, M., Regulating the interpersonal self: Strategic self-regulation for coping with rejection sensitivity (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, pp. 776-792; Ayduk, O., Zayas, V., Downey, G., Cole, A.B., Shoda, Y., Mischel, W., Rejection sensitivity and executive control: Joint predictors of borderline personality features (2008) Journal of Research in Personality, 42, pp. 151-168. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2007.04.002; Bechara, A., Damasio, A.R., Damasio, H., Anderson, S.W., Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex (1994) Cognition, 50, pp. 7-15. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(94)90018-3; Brooks, P.J., Hanauer, J.B., Frye, D., Training 3-year-olds in rule-based causal reasoning (2001) British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 19, pp. 573-595; Carlson, S.M., Davis, A.C., Leach, J.G., Less is more: Executive function and symbolic representation in preschool children (2005) Psychological Science, 16, pp. 609-616; Crone, E.A., van der Molen, M.W., Developmental changes in real life decision making: Performance on a gambling task previously shown to depend on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (2004) Developmental Neuropsychology, 25, pp. 251-279; DeLoache, J.S., Miller, K.F., Rosengren, K.S., The credible shrinking room: Very young children's performance with symbolic and nonsymbolic relations (1997) Psychological Science, 8, pp. 308-313; Diamond, A., Carlson, S.M., Beck, D.M., Preschool children's performance in task switching on the Dimensional Change Card Sort Task: Separating the dimensions aids the ability to switch (2005) Developmental Neuropsychology, 28, pp. 689-729; Garon, N., Johnson, B., Steeves, A., Sharing with others and delaying for the future in preschoolers (2011) Cognitive Development, 26, pp. 383-396; Garon, N.M., Longard, J., Bryson, S.E., Moore, C., Making decisions about now and later: Development of future-oriented self-control (2012) Cognitive Development, 27, pp. 314-322. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2012.05.003; Gollin, E.S., A developmental approach to learning and cognition (1965) Advances in child development and behavior, 2, pp. 159-186. , In L.

It was on the occasion of a visit to the New York World's Fair in 1964 that the famous science fiction writer Isaac Asimov decided to jump forward half a century and imagine what might be on show at the 2014 equivalent. In that article, published in 1964, Asimov showed astonishing foresight, whether it be about modes of transport, telecommunications, automation, demographic growth or the in-built limitations of our planet. And if at times Asimov was wrong (he thought, for example, that human beings would by now have built under the ground and beneath the oceans), re-reading this piece in the very year when its predictions are set reveals the powers of anticipation he possessed. To undertake a similar exercise today and attempt to forecast technological developments in 2064 would undoubtedly be a risky enterprise - mainly on account of the marked acceleration in the pace of technological advance.",,,,,,,,"Asimov, I.; Robots ou du cycle FondationFrance",,,"Futuribles",,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

Public and media attention has since been captured by the possibility of finding a cure for HIV transmitted from mother to child. Research into the strategy used for the Mississippi patient is crucially important to establish whether it can be replicated and shown to work in diverse populations. At the same time, any ethical issues likely to arise in such studies should be addressed and not ignored in the pursuit of a functional cure. In this Personal View we identify ethical issues that could arise in research towards achievment of a functional cure for HIV in neonates, including difficult trade-offs associated with choosing the study population and questions about the broader social implications of the research, and propose ways to resolve them. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; CD4 lymphocyte count; high risk population; HIV test; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection risk; information processing; informed consent; labor; mass medium; mother; newborn; newborn infection; note; population; priority journal; research ethics; risk benefit analysis; social aspect; United States; vertical transmission; virus transmission; Biomedical Research; HIV Infections; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical",,,,,"Persaud, D., Gay, H., Ziemniak, C., Absence of detectable HIV-1 viremia after treatment cessation in an infant (2013) N Engl J Med, 369, pp. 1828-1835; Hammer, S., Baby steps on the road to HIV eradication (2013) N Engl J Med, 369, pp. 1855-1857; UNAIDS global report on the AIDS epidemic, , http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/epidemiology/2013/gr2013/UNAIDS_Global_Report_2013_en.pdf, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, (accessed Nov 15, 2013); Lo, B., Grady, C., Ethical considerations in HIV cure research: points to consider (2013) Curr Opin HIV AIDS, 8, pp. 243-249. , Working Group on Ethics of the International AIDS Society; Sugarman, J., HIV cure research: expanding the ethical considerations (2013) Ann Intern Med, , http://ax.doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-159-7-201310010-00694, published online Aug 13; Eyal, N., Kuritzkes, D.R., Challenges in clinical trial design for HIV-1 cure research (2013) Lancet, 382, pp. 1464-1465; Nielsen-Saines, K., Watts, D.H., Veloso, V.G., Three postpartum antiretroviral regimens to prevent intrapartum HIV infection (2012) N Engl J Med, 366, pp. 2368-2379; Recommendations for use of antiretroviral drugs in pregnant HIV-1 infected women for maternal health and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States, , http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/perinatalgl.pdf, US Department of Health and Human Services, (accessed Nov 15, 2013); Haase, A.T., Early events in sexual transmission of HIV and SIV and opportunities for interventions (2011) Ann Rev Med, 62, pp. 127-139; Mello, M.M., Brennan, T.A., The controversy over high-dose chemotherapy with utologous bone marrow transplant for breast cancer (2000) Health Aff, 20, pp. 101-117; Angell, M., Investigators' responsibilities for human participants in developing countries (2000) N Engl J Med, 342, pp. 967-969; Resnik, D., The ethics of HIV research in developing nations (1998) Bioethics, 12, pp. 286-306; Declaration of Helsinki-ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, , http://www.wma.net/en/20activities/10ethics/10helsinki/, World Medical Association, (accessed Nov 15, 2013); International ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects.

Motivated by an interest in extremely complex sociotechnical contexts (e.g.; mortgage lending and automated trading) where ICT appears to be having negative consequences in addition to many benefits, this paper identifies and evaluates future-oriented problem analysis and solution design tools in three potentially relevant literatures: 1) ICT ethics, 2) environmental sustainability, and 3) technology hazards. Several promising future-oriented technology analysis techniques (e.g.; anticipatory technology ethics, technology roadmapping, morphological analysis, and control structure analysis) were found and are discussed in this paper, but much work remains to be done to customize them, integrate them, and codify them for use in education and high-quality IS research on very complex sociotechnical contexts like the global financial network. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Future-oriented technology analysis methods; ICT ethics; Morphological analysis; Negative consequences of information and communication technologies (ICT); Sociotechnical systems; Technology hazards; Technology roadmapping; Technology transition studies","Complex networks; Hazards; Industrial management; Linguistics; Morphology; Philosophical aspects; ICT ethics; Information and Communication Technologies; Morphological analysis; Sociotechnical systems; Technology analysis; Technology roadmapping; Technology transition; Information technology",,,,,"Ahlqvist, T., Back, A., Heinonen, S., Halonen, M., Road-mapping the societal transformation potential of social media (2010) Foresight, 12 (5), pp. 3-26. , 10.1108/14636681011075687; Arthur, W.B., (2009) The Nature of Technology: What It Is and How It Evolves: Simon and Schuster; Beladi, H., Mukherjee, A., Market structure and strategic bi-sourcing (2012) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 82 (1), pp. 210-219. , 10.1016/j.jebo.2012.01.004 10.1016/j.jebo.2012.01.004; Bose, U., An ethical framework in information systems decision making using normative theories of business ethics (2012) Ethics and Information Technology, 14, pp. 17-26. , 10.1007/s10676-011-9283-5; Brey, P.A.E., Anticipatory technology ethics for emerging technologies (2012) Nanoethics, 6, pp. 1-13. , 10.1007/s11569-012-0141-7; Card, S.K., Mackinlay, J.D., Robertson, G.G., A morphological analysis of the design space of input devices (1991) ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 9 (2), pp. 99-122. , 10.1145/123078.128726; Clarke, L., (1999) Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents to Tame Disaster, , University of Chicago Press Chicago; Clarke, L., (2006) Worst Cases: Terror and Catastrophe in the Popular Imagination, , University of Chicago Press Chicago; Cornish, E., (2004) Futuring: The Exploration of the Future, , World Future Society Bethesda; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes-new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22 (3), pp. 93-111. , 10.1002/for.848; Da Costa, O., Boden, M., Friedewald, M., Science and technology roadmapping for policy intelligence: Lessons for future projects (2005) Second Prague Workshoop on Futures Studies Methodology, Prague; Davies, T., Chandler, R., Online deliberation design: Choices, criteria, and evidence (2012) Democracy in Motion: Evaluating the Practice and Impact of Deliberative Civic Engagement, pp. 102-131. , T.

Combining two unique data sources from the air-travel industry (posted fare data and booking data), we use a structural model to estimate the fraction of strategic consumers in the population, assuming different levels of sophistication in consumers' perception of future prices: perfect foresight and weak- and strong-form rational expectations. We find that 5.2% to 19.2% of the population is strategic across markets, measured by the first and third quartiles. Our intermarket analysis indicates that shorter trips with more attractive outside options are populated with more strategic consumers. Using a nonparametric approach, we further find that most strategic consumers arrive either at the beginning of the booking horizon or close to departure. Finally, our counterfactual analysis shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the presence of strategic consumers does not necessarily hurt revenues. Rather, the impact varies by market. Commitment to a nondecreasing pricing strategy is more likely to benefit business markets than leisure markets, or it could even hurt leisure markets.

Clothing the bare bones of Norbert Wiener's conception of cybernetics, the book delineates for the new science the requirement (of having direct impacts on engineering applications), the aim (of encapsulating engineering principles and concepts), the problems (of analysis, design, and uncertainty), the tools (of basic and advanced mathematics), and the scope (systems that are single input and output or multiple input and output, linear or nonlinear, deterministic or stochastic). The book is a showcase of originality, critical thinking and foresights. In particular, the author calls into question the basic assumption that 'the properties and characteristics of the system to be controlled were always assumed to be known' and points out that, in reality, 'large unpredictable variations of the system properties may occur'. Sixty years later, the full spectrum of Tsien's prophetic ideas is yet to be fully grasped and engineering cybernetics, as Tsien envisioned, is still in the making. © 2014 South China University of Technology, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Active disturbance rejection; Cybernetics; Engineering cybernetics; Engineering science; Feedback","Disturbance rejection; Feedback; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Active disturbance rejection; Critical thinking; Engineering applications; Engineering principles; Engineering science; Hsue-Shen Tsien; Multiple inputs; System property; Cybernetics",,,,,"Tsien, H.S., (1954) Engineering Cybernetics, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Åström, K.J., Kumar, P.R., Control: a perspective (2014) Automatica, 50 (1), pp. 3-43; (2009) New York Times, 11 (3); Adamson Jr., T.C., Feedback (2010) IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 30 (3), pp. 12-16; Cohen, S.K., Marble, F.E., Shirley, K., (1994) Oral History Project, California Institute of Technology Archives, , http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechOH:OH_Marble_F, Cohen.

The future that is being imagined however often exhibits a form of techno-optimism. This paper critiques that optimism by describing the #Patchworks project in which science fiction prototypes were used to explore the social implications of who does the imagining. Through our vignette we explore how the promissory nature of science fiction prototyping folds back into the present to change current understandings of real life situations. We suggest that the power to imagine and invent futures is often not extended to vulnerable communities, nor does it take into account the differing authority and agency depending on who is telling and who feels able to tell stories. The collision between these different stories and backgrounds in #Patchworks, the co-design project informing this paper, has produced contradictions and negotiations between the speculative practice of 'tinkering' used by DIY hackers that act as 'openings', an academic focus on innovation and the 'anchoring' inherent in the need to produce practical prototypes that solve urgent problems. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Co-design; Community; Foresight; Future imaginaries; Innovation; Science fiction prototyping","Innovation; Personal computing; Co-designs; Community; Foresight; Imaginaries; Science fictions; Social aspects; innovation; labor relations; science and technology",,,,,"Sanders, E.B.-N., Stappers, P.J., Co-creation and the new landscapes of design (2008) CoDesign, 4 (1), pp. 5-18; Steen, M., Tensions in human-centred design (2011) CoDesign, 7 (1), pp. 45-60; Johnson, B.D., (2011) Science fiction prototyping: designing the future with science fiction, , Morgan & Claypool; Bleecker, J., Design Fiction: A Short Essay on Design, Science, Fact and Fiction.

Based originally on research published in 2005, here it is revised and updated to take account of subsequent developments within and beyond the academy. These include advances in women’s involvement in sport in the past eight years or so that have some significance for the purposes of the present analysis. During this time further contributions to the corpus of work on figurational sociology (and its application to sport) were also published. Taken together, these are the theoretical building blocks and empirical foci for the purposes of the present discussion. The chapter originates from a distinctly Eliasian conceptualization of interdependence. Drawing on the notion of homines aperti-that is, on the idea of an ever-larger circle of people in modern societies with whom any single individual is connected, no matter how momentarily-Elias spoke of: the ""conveyor belts"" running through individuals’ lives growing ""longer and more complex"", requiring us to ""attune"" our conduct to the actions of others, and becoming the dominant influence on our existence, so that we are less ""prisoners of our passions"" and more captive to the requirements of an increasingly complex ""web of actions"", particularly a demand for ""constant hindsight and foresight in interpreting the actions and intentions of others.""

Objective To demonstrate the usefulness of performing neurophysiological and neuropsychological assessments in patients, in order to demonstrate the significant role of the emotions in the execution of certain behaviours. Methods A forensic psychiatric interview was conducted. EEG in vigil state was registered, the generators of current density to theta band were calculated, and the emotions recognition test was performed. Results The results of the psychiatric interview demonstrated that fear was an important element in acting impulsively, and lack of foresight of the accused. A substantial decrease was demonstrated in the ability to understand the scope of the acts and the direction of the behaviour during the time the crime occurred. The EEG showed alterations in frontal regions, and the generators of current density were located in frontal-temporal regions and occipital associative areas. Conclusions It is recommended to associate these studies with the forensic psychiatric assessment, in order to increase the objectivity of the diagnoses formulated by medical experts. © 2013 Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatr?a.

A substantial English-speaking population compacted an alliance with a sizable sector of Afrikaans speakers under the leadership of Jan Smuts to form the United Party, dedicated to a unified, bilingual South Africa with strong ties to the wider British Commonwealth. The largest majority of Afrikaans speakers nurtured a desire for republican autonomy and Afrikaner cultural supremacy. In 1939, both sides of the divide were employed by the SABC, which tended to wait until the waters cleared before making any strong policy decisions on broadcasting either way. Once it became clear that the country would go to war, the SABC threw its weight behind this effort. Programming, including news, was relayed from the British Broadcasting Corporation, keeping South Africans up to date with the war efforts. World War II fundamentally changed social, economic and political relationships on a global scale. René Caprara's foresight of a National Party in power came to pass, and with it, the SABC changed too. But for the war years at least, South African broadcasting had firmly been part of a larger Empire. © 2014 Critical Arts Projects and Unisa Press.","British Broadcasting Corporation; Daventry; Mobile recording units; North African Campaign; Propaganda; South African Broadcasting Corporation; World War II",,,,,,"Ballinger, M., (1969) From Union to Apartheid: A Trek to Isolation, , New York: Praeger Publishers; Boyd-Barrett, O., Rantanen, T., (1998) The Globalization of News, , London: Sage; Ceva, L., The North African campaign, 1940-43: A reconsideration (1990) Journal of Strategic Studies, 13 (1), pp. 84-104; Gooch, J., Decisive campaigns of the Second World War: An introduction (1990) Journal of Strategic Studies, 13 (1), pp. 1-9; Green, J., Massignai, A., (1994) Rommel's North African Campaign, September 1940-November 1942, , Boston, MA: Da Capo Press; Hachten, W.A., (1971) Muffled Drums; the News Media in Africa, , Iowa: Iowa State University Press; (1939) Union of South Africa 1939: Debates of the House of Assembly.

When the coal is being mined, it is seriously threatened by Ordovician karst water with high pressure. Water inrush accidents often happen in North China type coal mine which has become an important factor affecting the safety in production of the coal mine. Taking Dong Shan coal mine as an example, the paper analyzed the principle of water-inrush from coal floor of the mine by summarizing the mine water inrush in the coal mine. Early-warning indexes of water inrush which include water temperature, water pressure, stress and strain were built. Structure of prediction system for water-inrush disaster was designed, and the hardware and software of the system were developed. Industrial test for the prediction system was done in 51523 Faces. Practice shows that the prediction system can monitor early-warning indexes of water inrush in real time, and as well to distinguish the mine water inrush risk which can provide the foresight of the information for preventing water inrush disaster. © 2013 IEEE.","early warning system; Northern China Coalfield; remote monitoring and control; water inrush from coal floor","Coal; Coal deposits; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Floors; Forecasting; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Mine flooding; Safety factor; Coal fields; Early Warning System; Hardware and software; Hydrogeology conditions; Remote monitoring and control; Water inrush disasters; Water temperatures; Water-inrush from coal floor; Coal mines",,,,,"Bu, C.S., Zhang, X.C., Yin, W.C., Qu, X.S., Inundation in the North-China type coalfields and the status quo of its protection (2001) Geological Review, 47 (4), pp. 405-410; Jin, D.W., Theory, methods and application in analyzing the forecasting information of water inrush from the bottom coal layer in northern china coalfield (2003) Carsologica Sinica, 22 (1), pp. 41-46. , In Chinese; Xu, M.Z., Wang, Z.Y., Study on the technology of advance forecasting underground water and mud in rush during tunnel construction in karst area (2005) Journal of Highway and Transportation Research and Development, 22 (6), pp. 123-126. , In Chinese; Wu, Q., Wang, M., Wu, X., Investigations of groundwater bursting into coal mine seam floors from fault zones (2004) International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 41 (4), pp. 557-571. , In Chinese; Sui, W.H., Liu, J.Y., Yang, S.G., Hydrogeological analysis and salvage of a deep coalmine after an underground water inrush (2011) Environmental Earth Sciences, 62 (4), pp. 735-749. , In Chinese; Shi, L.Q., Summary of research on mechanism of water-inrush from coal seam floor (2009) Journal of Shandong University of Science Technology (Natural Science), 28 (3), pp. 17-23. , In Chinese; Gao, Y.F., Zhang, Y.P., Zhang, H.M., Research and placation on expert system for risk assessment of water inrush from coal floor (2009) Chinese Journal of Rock Mechanics and Engineering, 28 (2), pp. 253-238. , In Chinese; Feng, Q.Y., Yang, T.H., Yu, Q.J., Numerical simulation on waterinrush from the seam floor based on the coupled analysis of seepage and damage (2006) Journal of Safety and Environment, 20 (3), pp. 1-4. , In Chinese; Hu, W.Y., Zhu, K.P., Huang, X.M., Study on floor rock mass failure and water inrush caused by non-uniform distributed water pressure in mining face (2010) Journal of China Coal Society, 35 (7), pp. 1109-1114. , In Chinese; Cong, W.Q., Pan, M., Ren, Q.Z., Building and application of the debris flow warning system based on multi-information (2006) Acta Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis, 1 (1), pp. 1-5. , In Chinese; Cheng, J.F., Zhou, Z.L., Liu, C., Application of coal and gas outburst pre-warning technique and computer system in yuyang coal mine (2010) Mining Safety & Environmental Protection, 37 (3), pp. 44-46. , In Chinese","Liu, D.; College of Geoscience and Surveying Engineering, China University of Mining and TechnologyChina",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2013 International Conference on Information Science and Cloud Computing Companion, ISCC-C 2013","7 December 2013 through 8 December 2013",,109577,,9781479952458,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model is applicable for business units and medium enterprises. It is a sequential model that gives a smooth transition from strategic vigilance to a selection of projects and programs which helps the organization to attain a competitive advantage in industry environment. Based on the most common tools of strategic planning and foresight, the main idea is to generate some sense of sequence and feedback process, in order to select the best ideas for the resource allocation optimization. Findings: When the project portfolio is defined by a set of rules or criteria, the construction of a technology roadmap is the next logical step, not only to classify the projects but to create a path through which the organization can implement them. A methodology to plan all this process was developed. Originality/value: This proposed model helps in the integration of the strategic planning with the step-by-step process at the functional level to run the projects and programs. © 2014 PICMET.",,"Competition; Competitive advantage; Design/methodology/approach; Industry environment; Medium sized organizations; Resource allocation optimization; Strategic objectives; Technology roadmapping; Technology roadmaps; Strategic planning",,,,,"Baugh, D.W.P., Jr., Introduction (2003) Six Sigma Deployment, pp. xviii-xix. , Burlington, MA, Elsevier Science; Dowries, L., Nunes, P.F., Big-bang disruption (2013) Harvard Business Review, pp. 44-56. , March; Breyfogle, F.W., Cupello, J.M., Meadows, B., (2001) Managing Six Sigma: A Practical Guide to Understanding, Assesing, and Implementing the Strategy That Yields Bottom-line Success, , New York, New York: John Wiley &Sons; Mintzberg, H., Ahlstrand, B., Lampel, J., (1998) Strategy Safari: A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Strategic Management, , New York, NY: THE FREE PRESS; Mintzberg, H., The strategy concept ii: Another look at why organizations need strategies (1987) California Management Review, 30 (1), pp. 25-32; Waltuck, B., What's the point of planing?

Material and Method: The study included 2150 autopsies performed between January 2000 and December 2012at our institute. Diagnoses were categorized according to the detected pathologies; congenital malformations were detailed based on systems. Results: A pathology was detected in 1619 of 2150 (73.3%) autopsies. Congenital malformations were the most common diagnosis with 68.2%. Neural tube defects and central nervous system malformations were the most frequent system malformation in 28.8% of cases, followed by the urogenital system (11.4%) and musculoskeletal system (8.3%), respectively. Malformation syndromes including multisystem anomalies were defined in 109 cases (9.3%). Conclusion: Congenital malformations are the most common reason for perinatal deaths, with autopsy having an additive role to prenatal and genetic evaluations and providing foresight for planning a subsequent pregnancy.","Autopsy; Congenital abnormalities; Perinatal mortality; Prenatal diagnosis; Syndrome","aneuploidy; article; autopsy; central nervous system malformation; chorioamnionitis; chromosome deletion; chromosome disorder; congenital malformation; fetus; gastrointestinal malformation; human; human tissue; infant; Klinefelter syndrome; major clinical study; malformation syndrome; musculoskeletal system malformation; neural tube defect; newborn; perinatal death; respiratory tract malformation; sirenomelia; systemic disease; triploidy; trisomy; Turkey (republic); Turner syndrome; urogenital tract malformation; autopsy; cause of death; female; male; perinatal death; retrospective study; stillbirth; Turkey; Autopsy; Cause of Death; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Perinatal Death; Retrospective Studies; Stillbirth; Turkey",,,,,"Lawn, J., Shibuya, K., Stein, C., No cry at birth: Global estimates of intrapartum stillbirths and intrapartum-related neonatal deaths (2005) Bull World Health Organ, 83, pp. 409-417; Tomatir, A.G., Demirhan, H., Sorkun, H.C., Koksal, A., Ozerdem, F., Cilengir, N., Major congenital anomalies: A five-year retrospective regional study in Turkey (2009) Genet Mol Res, 8, pp. 19-27; Faye-Petersen, O.M., Guinn, D.A., Wenstrom, K.D., Value of perinatal autopsy (1999) Obstet Gynecol, 94, pp. 915-920; Giordano, G., Fellegara, G., Brigati, F., Gramellini, D., Magnani, C., Value of autopsy in renal malformations: Comparison of clinical diagnosis and post-mortem examination (2011) Acta Biomed, 82, pp. 230-243; Kalyani, R., Bindra, M.S., Mahansetty, H., Congenital malformations in perinatal autopsy: A two-year prospective study (2013) J Indian Med Assoc, 111, pp. 89-93; Hakverdi, S., Guzelmansur, I., Gungoren, A., Toprak, S., Yaldiz, M., Hakverdi, A.U., Evaluation of fetal autopsy findings in the Hatay region: 274 cases (2012) Turk Patoloji Derg, 28, pp. 154-161; Sankar, V.H., Phadke, S.R., Clinical utility of fetal autopsy and comparison with prenatal ultrasound findings (2006) J Perinatol, 26, pp. 224-229; Grover, N., Congenital malformations in Shimla (2000) Indian J Pediatr, 67, pp. 249-251; Ceylaner, G., Ceylaner, S., Gunyeli, I., Ekici, E., Celasun, B., Danisman, N., Evaluation of 2407 fetuses in a Turkish population (2007) Prenal Diagn, 27, pp. 800-807; Andola, U.S., Am, A., Ahuja, M., Andola, S.K., Congenital malformations in perinatal autopsies-a study of 100 cases (2012) J Clin Diagn Res, 6, pp. 1726-1730; Ramalho, C., Brandao, O., Monterroso, J., Matias, A., Montenegro, N., Cardiac findings in routine fetal autopsies: More than meets the eye?

Among emerging technologies, nanotechnology is one of the most prominent, and it raises high expectations in a wide range of areas affecting daily life. The risks to human health, the pathways of exposure to nanomaterials, and occupational safety are recent issues which require more attention. The study was performed on nanopatents by collecting, processing and analyzing information extracted from specialized patent databases covering the period from 1991 to 2011, totalling 1,343 patents and representing 36 countries. These patents were classified by the International Patent Classification, using the methodology proposed in a study published by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which resulted in six groups of patents, distributed as follows: nanomaterials (40.3 %), medicine and biotechnology (26.6 %), measurement and production (10 %), electronics (2.7 %), energy and the environment (2.2 %), and optical electronics (1 %). Around 17 % of the patents in question did not fall into the adopted classification. The aim of this paper is to analyze the main trends of patenting related to nanotechnology, its development and environmental implications. An additional goal is to assist policy-makers to adjust the regulatory framework on nanotechnology, and to make recommendations for governments, industry, and national organizations, on creating specific subsidies for regulatory framework in Brazil. © 2014 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Nanomaterials; Nanotechnology; Patent analyses; Regulatory framework; Technological foresight",,,,,,"Allarakhia, M., Walsh, S., Analyzing and organizing nanotechnology development: Application of the institutional analysis development framework to nanotechnology consortia (2012) Technovation, 32 (3-4), pp. 216-226; Antunes, A.M.S., Alencar, M.S.M., Silva, C.H., Nunes, J., Mendes, F.M.L., Trends in nanotechnology patents applied to the health sector (2012) Recent Patents in Nanotechnology, 6, pp. 29-41; Blackman, M., World patent information-the first 25 years (2004) World Patent Information, 26 (1), pp. 13-24; Blind, K., Gauch, S., Research and standardisation in nanotechnology: Evidence from Germany (2009) The Journal of Technology Transfer, 34 (3), pp. 320-342; Borm, P.J.A., Robbins, D., Haubold, S., Kuhlbusch, T., Fissan, H., Donaldson, K., The potential risks of nanomaterials: A review carried out for ECETOC (2006) Particle and Fibre Toxicology, , doi:10.1186/1743-8977-3-11; (2005) Ministério do Planejamento.

The LSA concept aims at improving spectrum usage efficiency by introducing additional licensed spectrum users on spectrum bands whose incumbent use would permit it, while guaranteeing certain quality of service (QoS) for all users. The LSA concept could help mobile network operators (MNOs) to gain access to new spectrum bands on a shared basis in a timely manner. As the LSA concept is based on voluntariness, it needs to provide incentives for the incumbent spectrum users for the introduction of sharing. Using a foresight approach called integral scenario methodology, we propose a set of scenarios for incumbent spectrum users in LSA based on their business focus (defensive vs. aggressive) and mode of change (open vs. closed). The created scenarios are described and analyzed from regulation, business and technology perspectives, highlighting the business potential created by the introduction of LSA. The evaluation of the developed business scenarios indicates that a defensive approach for the business focus for incumbents might be preferred to focus narrowly on traditional business models. However, an aggressive approach to pursue new business opportunities with LSA might open up new opportunities which, today, cannot yet be foreseen. © 2014 ICST.","Business Scenarios; Licensed Shared Access; LSA; Spectrum sharing","Cognitive radio; Quality of service; Business models; Business opportunities; Business scenario; Licensed Shared Access; LSA; Mobile network operators; Spectrum sharing; Spectrum usage; Wireless networks",,,,,"(2013) Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation, , Presidential Memorandum, The White House, June; (2011) Assessment of the Global Mobile Broadband Deployments and Forecasts for International Mobile Telecommunications, , Report ITU-R M. 2243; (2013) European Commission Radio Spectrum Policy Group RSPG13-538 Opinion on Licensed Shared Access, , Brussels.

This is not simply because telling questions are being asked of the alliance in relation to Afghanistan and Ukraine, but because the twin motors which have sustained NATO now show signs of considerable wear and tear. The first of these motors relates to principles of purpose. This encompasses the activities (or purposes) which NATO has consciously pursued in the last 25 years: namely, operations, enlargement, partnership, transatlanticism and security. The second is principles of function: the means, in other words, by which NATO is kept in motion. Here, American leadership, cohesion and trust, burden-sharing and credibility all matter. These motors are not about to completely break down (NATO has underlying strengths which make that unlikely) but they do need attention. NATO's good health requires it to focus on a series of core tasks-what this article refers to as readiness, reassurance and renewal. These three tasks speak to an agenda of consolidation and preservation, rather than one of task expansion. But this is not a conservative agenda; grasping the nettle of prioritization and focus requires, in itself, a certain foresight and enterprise. Managed successfully, it is an agenda that will preserve and strengthen NATO in what are increasingly troubled times. © 2014 The Royal Institute of International Affairs.",,,,,,,"http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/49-95/c900706a.htm, 'London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic Alliance', London, 5-6 July 1990, accessed 11 June 2014; http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_56425.htm?selectedLocale=en, 'Comprehensive political guidance endorsed by NATO heads of state and government', 29 Nov. 2006, accessed 11 June 2014; Wergin, C., The security leadership void (2014) International New York Times, , 28 Jan; Dorman, A., NATO's 2012 Chicago summit: a chance to ignore the issues once again?

For each resulting quadrant, I select one or more ""seed topics"" related to the underlying suite-theme of global water stress and access scarcity, seeking in particular those topics which resonate with the scenario, and adding additional context where suited.I then present the four resulting prototype vignettes separately, introducing the seed topics and theoretical context, sketching out the ""world"" of the scenario in which it is set, presenting the prototypes themselves in synopsis form, and finally discussing the technological and social implications which emerge from each narrative, and their relationships with the scenarios from which they stem.Finally, I discuss the suitability of this methodology in the context of projects which focus on considering possibilities for infrastructural developments rather than evaluating discreet new technologies, and position it in the context of contemporary science fiction literature. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Forecasting; Infrastructure; Prototyping; Social change; Strategic foresight; Water stress","Forecasting; Innovation; Software prototyping; Technological forecasting; Experimental methodology; Infrastructural development; Infrastructure; Science fictions; Social changes; Social implication; Strategic foresight; Water stress; Technology transfer; infrastructural development; innovation; social change; trend analysis",,,,,"Johnson, B.D., (2011) Science Fiction Prototyping: Designing the Future with Science Fiction, , Morgan & Claypool, San Francisco, CA; Facts and trends; water version 2, , http://wbcsd.org/DocRoot/lD1tMGiLZ7NL9mBOL2aQ/WaterFactsAndTrends-Update.pdf, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, Accessed November 9, 2012; Cosgrove, W., Rijsberman, F., (2000) World Water Vision: Making Water Everybody's Business, pp. ix. , for the World Water Council, Earthscan Publications Ltd., London; Vörösmarty, C.J., McIntyre, P.B., Gessner, M.O., Dudgeon, D., Prusevich, A., Green, P., Glidden, S., Global threats to human water security and river biodiversity (2010) Nature, 467 (7315), pp. 555-561; Kallis, G., Coevolution in water resource development (2010) Ecol.

Effective monitoring is needed to identify complications quickly and allow timely correction. Near-infrared spectroscopy has been used extensively in cerebral monitoring during cardiac surgery. We present its use in monitoring lower extremity perfusion in patients on ECMO. Five patients on ECMO had near-infrared spectroscopy monitors placed on the calf of both lower extremities. Continuous real-time tissue oxygen saturation data (stO2) was displayed and recorded. Two patients had lower extremity complications in the leg with the arterial cannula. The patients with complications had lower stO2 in the cannulated leg at the time of ECMO insertion, larger differences in stO2 between the legs at the time of insertion, lower nadir stO2s, and larger peak differences in stO2 between the legs than patients without limb complications. The use of near-infrared spectroscopy for continuous monitoring of tissue oxygenation in the lower extremities in patients on ECMO may allow early identification of patients with lower extremity complications. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,"aged; Article; cannula; cardiogenic shock; case report; coronary stenting; dacron implant; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; leg; limb disease; limb perfusion; male; near infrared imaging system; near infrared spectroscopy; oxygen saturation; patient monitoring; priority journal; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; tissue oxygenation; Doppler echography; extracorporeal oxygenation; heart surgery; ischemia; near infrared spectroscopy; oximetry; patient monitoring; Postoperative Complications; procedures; reproducibility; vascularization; Aged; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Humans; Ischemia; Leg; Male; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Oximetry; Postoperative Complications; Reproducibility of Results; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Pulsed",,,"Foresight System, CAS Medical Systems, United States","Bard, United States; CAS Medical Systems, United States","Ko, W.J., Lin, C.Y., Chen, R.J., Wang, S.S., Lin, F.Y., Chen, Y.S., Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for adult postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (2002) Ann Thorac Surg, 73, pp. 538-545; Smedira, N.G., Moazami, N., Golding, C.M., Clinical experience with 202 adults receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiac failure: Survival at five years (2001) J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 122, pp. 92-102; Aziz, F., Brehm, C.E., El-Banyosy, A., Han, D.C., Atnip, R.G., Reed, A.B., Arterial complications in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation via femoral cannulation (2014) Ann Vasc Surg, 28, pp. 178-183; MacLeod, D.B., Ikeda, K., Vacchiano, C., Absolute and trending accuracy of FORE-SIGHT and INVOS cerebral oximeters in healthy volunteers (2009) Proceedings of 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, New Orleans, , abstract; Rigamonti, A., Scandroglio, M., Minicucci, F., Magrin, S., Carozzo, A., Casati, A., A clinical evaluation of near-infrared cerebral oximetry in the awake patient to monitor cerebral perfusion during carotid endarterectomy (2005) J Clin Anesth, 17, pp. 426-430; Yao, F.-S.F., Tseng, C.-C.A., Ho, C.-Y.A., Levin, S.K., Illner, P., Cerebral oxygen desaturation is associated with early postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (2004) J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth, 18, pp. 552-558","Moazami, N.; Depts. of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology, and Cardiac Perfusion, Lerner College of Medicine, Cleveland ClinicUnited States; email: moazamn@ccf.org",,,"Elsevier USA",,,,,00034975,,ATHSA,"25441810","English","Ann.

This essay attempts to route one pathway to a potentially more robust conceptual synthesis, employing the globally important example of anchovies and sardines as a model. Expressly, the anchovy emerges as an efficient specialist of neritic origin. In contrast, the sardine's oceanic-based adaptations equip it to deal with intermittent episodes of poorly productive conditions and to take advantage of associated reduction in predation pressure on early life stages of their offspring. Based on the overall synthesis, the nimble, wide-ranging, actively opportunistic sardine appears notably well equipped to deal with climate-related disruptions and dislocations and even to profit from their adverse effects on predators and competitors. Global-scale multispecies population synchronies in the 1970s to the mid-1980s suggest that a variety of different species types might be flagged for investigation as perhaps embodying similar ""active opportunist"" attributes. If so, events and anecdotes might, as global changes proceed, be viewed within a developing universal framework that could support increasingly effective transfers of experience and predictive foresight across different species groups and regional ecosystems. © 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

As a growing literature in security studies and political geography has argued, preparing for catastrophe, expecting the worst, and scripting disasters are central elements of contemporary, speculative security culture. One of the most-discussed findings of the 9/11 Commission Report was that US security services had insufficiently deployed their imagination to foresee and preempt the attacks. This article introduces a special issue that offers a range of in-depth empirical studies that analyse how the imperative of ‘routinizing the imagination’ plays out in practice across different policy domains. It deploys the lens of performativity in order to conceptualize and explain the materialization of preemption and its situated entanglements with pre-existing security bureaucracies. We detail the idealized traits of a ‘security of the interstice’, which include interoperability, emergence, flexibility and analytical foresight that are meant to bridge the perceived gaps of security spaces and the temporal bridges between present and possible futures. The lofty rhetoric of preparing for the worst and bridging the gaps encounters numerous obstacles, challenges and reversals in practice. As becomes clear through the notion of performativity, such obstacles and challenges do not just ‘stand in the way’ of implementation, but actively shape the materialization of preemption in different sectors. © The Author(s) 2014.","Europe; performativity; post-9/11; preemption; security; speculation",,,,,,"(2004) Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, , Washington, DC: ; :, National Commission on Terrorist Attacks; Amoore, L., Vigilant visualities: The watchful politics of the War on Terror (2007) Security Dialogue, 38 (2), pp. 215-232; Amoore, L., (2013) The Politics of Possibility: Risk and Security Beyond Probability, , Durham, NC: ; :, Duke University Press; Amoore, L., Security and the incalculable (2014) Security Dialogue, 45 (5), pp. 423-439; Anderson, B., Preemption, precaution, preparedness: Anticipatory action and future geographies (2010) Progress in Human Geography, 34 (6), pp. 777-798; Anderson, B., Adey, P., Governing events and life: ‘Emergency’ in UK Civil Contingencies (2012) Political Geography, 31 (1), pp. 24-33; Anderson, B., Harrison, P., (2010) Taking Place: Non-representational Theories and Geography, pp. 1-36. , Anderson BHarrison P, ed.

This regional cooperation, although set in a general framework of EU Member States and non-EU states utilising existing Regional Sea Conventions as focal point, develops along different tracks. Based on a series of interviews with different stakeholder groups in the different regional seas the drivers for this regional cooperation were determined. These drivers were used to develop a set of scenarios to depict possible ways and structures for cooperation at the different regional seas. In this paper the result of this analysis and the different scenarios developed are presented. The five scenarios developed were very helpful in elaborating alternative governance models for regional cooperation. From the validation by the stakeholders it became clear that both the drivers used, as the scenarios developed were found to be relevant. There is no single solution that is going to fit all regional seas, or that is going to appeal to all stakeholders within a regional sea.

Some examples are technology intelligence, forecasting, road mapping, and foresight. All of these techniques fit into a field that we call Technology Futures Analysis (TFA). Unfortunately, both competitive and forecasting analyses are not well utilized in company decision-making, especially those based on analytical patent analysis. Three factors could enhance managerial utilization: capability to exploit huge volumes of available information, ways to do it very quickly, and informative representations that help to discover emerging technologies. This paper reports an effort to address these three goals via a brand new method of analysis conceived to quickly and graphically generate helpful knowledge from patents. The first novelty is to adopt a function-oriented process to identify the most important features of a product or technology. Then, we exemplify a method to manage patent search that integrates functional basis with physical and chemical effects library. The outcome is a concise and graphical state of art, which helps to define players and patterns in the development of a target technology. This takes the form of a infographic map, and is finally used to discover emerging technologies, white space opportunities or new market potentials. All the Text mining process is supported by Kompat, a semantic search engine explicitly conceived for forecasting patent search. © 2014 IEEE.","Competitive Technological Intelligence; Patent Search; Technology Forecasting; Technology State of Art; Text Mining; White space Opportunities","Data mining; Patents and inventions; Search engines; Semantics; Patent search; Technological intelligence; Technology forecasting; Text mining; White space; Technological forecasting",,,,,"Chandrasekaran, B., Representing function: Relating functional representation and functional modeling research streams (2005) Ai Edam, 19 (2); Zhu, D., Porter, A.L., Automated extraction and visualization of information for technological intelligence and forecasting (2002) Technol.

In such a context, it is more than ever necessary to rationalize public spending, including both operating and investment expenditure. Public investment expenditure represents around 15% of total French investment and concerns sectors as essential as transport, energy, health or education. And yet such expenditure has not been thoroughly evaluated, which is why the French Centre for Strategic Analysis (now renamed the General Strategy and Foresight Commission) was asked to examine the question of its socio-economic evaluation. Émile Quinet, who has been entrusted with this task, outlines the main lessons to be learned from the extensive report that came out of this exercise. After reminding us that new evaluation arrangements need to be envisaged (to take account of such changes as the increasing importance of climate matters), he presents the report's proposals with regard to updating the methodology of the socio-economic evaluation of public investment (discount rate, risk assessment, impact on employment and economic growth etc.) and recalls the importance of integrating long-term considerations into investment decisions, particularly in the field of transport. The aim is, ultimately, to provide decision-makers with the essential means to make informed decisions on public investments, even if, as Quinet reminds us in his conclusion, it remains difficult to carry out such evaluations on very long time scales and to make them in sectors as strategic as education or research.",,,,,,,"Boiteux, M., (1994) Transports: Pour un Meilleur Choix des Investissements, , Paris: Commissariat général du Plan; (2001) Transports: Choix des Investissements et Coûts des Nuisances, , Paris: La documentation Française; (2005) Le Prix du Temps et la Détision Publique, , Paris: La documentation Française / Commissariat général du Plan; (2008) La Valeur Tutélaire du Carbone, , Paris: La documentation Française / Centre d'analyse stratégique [CAS]; (2011) Le Calcul du Risque dans les Investissements Publics, , Paris: La documentation Française / CAS","Quinet, É.; PSE-ENPC (Paris School of Economics, École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées)France",,,"Futuribles",,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

It was designed with the foresight that the stabilization mechanism could only be elucidated if the observed volatile suspended solids reduction were correlated with the fate of particulate components in sludge. Biomass sustained at sludge ages of 2 and 10. days were used in the stabilization reactors. Particulate components were determined by model evaluation of corresponding oxygen uptake rate profiles. Interpretation of the experimental data by modeling, based on death-regeneration mechanism without external substrate, could simulate the fate and evolution of major components in sludge during stabilization. It showed that both microbial decay and hydrolysis of non viable cellular material proceeded at much slower rates as compared with biological systems sustained with substrate feeding. Modeling also indicated that particulate metabolic products generated by sludge acclimated to high sludge age undergo slow biodegradation under prolonged stabilization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerobic stabilization; Endogenous decay; Modeling; Particulate microbial products; Respirometry","Biodegradation; Models; Aerobic stabilization; Endogenous decay; Microbial products; Particulate components; Performance limitations; Respirometry; Stabilization mechanisms; Volatile suspended solids; Stabilization; volatile agent; oxygen; particulate matter; sewage; correlation; experimental study; hydrolysis; numerical model; oxygen; particulate matter; simulation; sludge; substrate; acclimatization; article; biodegradation; biology; biomass; correlation analysis; hydrolysis; nitrification; oxygen consumption; priority journal; reactor operation; sequencing batch reactor; sludge stabilization; steady state; stoichiometry; suspended particulate matter; aerobic metabolism; analysis; biochemical oxygen demand; bioreactor; calibration; chemistry; computer simulation; fractionation; metabolism; microbiology; particulate matter; sewage; theoretical model; Aerobiosis; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Biomass; Bioreactors; Calibration; Chemical Fractionation; Computer Simulation; Models, Theoretical; Oxygen; Particulate Matter; Sewage",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen; Particulate Matter; Sewage",,,"(2005) APHA, AWWA, WEF Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, , American Public Health Association/American Water Works Association/Water Environment Federation, Washington, DC, USA; Çi;ǧgi;n, A.S., Insel, G., Majone, M., Orhon, D., Model evaluation of starch utilization by acclimated biomass with different culture history under pulse and continuous feeding (2013) Bioresour.

Lake Yilong is an eutrophic lake that has received high nutrient loadings from the watershed during the past two decades, thus producing high nutrient concentrations in the water column. Because of the high nutrient concentration in the water column, the lake water surprisingly remained a clear state throughout the two-decade period until a sudden disappearance of aquatic vegetation accompanied by an intensive algae bloom in 2009 caused the lake water to shift to a turbid state. To help understand the mechanisms underlying the sudden regime shift, a three-dimensional model was developed based on the environmental fluid dynamic code platform to represent the dynamic interactions between watershed inputs, lake water quality, and aquatic ecosystem, as well as human interferences. The model fully couples the hydrodynamic and water quality process with enhancement to the submerged macrophyte module to better resolve the vertical light-nutrient-macrophyte interactions. The calibrated model was applied to simulate the catastrophic regime shift in Lake Yilong. The results suggest that the aquatic macrophyte vegetation in Lake Yilong had significant impacts on algae blooms in the lake, and the regime shift was likely caused by fish stocking in early 2009. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Catastrophic regime shift; Environmental fluids dynamics code; Fish predation; Hydrological process; Lake Yilong; Submerged macrophyte; Water quality process",,,,,,"Alarcon, V.J., McAnally, W.H., Using hydrodynamic modeling for estimating flooding and water depths in Grand Bay, Alabama (2012) Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2012, 7334, pp. 578-588. , Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg; Arhonditsis, G.B., Brett, M.T., Eutrophication model for Lake Washington (USA): Part I: Model description and sensitivity analysis (2005) Ecol.

Part one examines the role of denialism in the context of proposals advanced through the much-abused Limits to Growth (LtG) project. Part two uses three sets of criteria (domains of reality, worldviews and values) to characterise some of the interior human and social aspects of the “denial machine.” It uses these criteria to address some vital, but currently under-appreciated “interior” aspects of descent. (N.B. A succinct “primer” or overview of the concept an underpinning rationale for notions of “descent pathways” is provided in the introduction to this special issue.) Design/methodology/approach-The paper draws on a number of authoritative sources that track the dimensions of global change and, specifically, the ways that humanity is tracking towards Dystopian overshoot-and-collapse futures. The significance of the LtG project is assessed in this context. Part two employs the criteria noted above to identify and open out the centrality of the human and cultural interiors. Findings-Responses to the LtG project are shown to have deprived humanity of the clarity and will to respond effectively to the emerging global emergency. The rise of climate change denialism has followed suit and made effective responses increasingly difficult. A new focus, however, on some of the dynamics of reality domains, worldviews and values, clarifies both the nature of the problem and prefigures a range of solutions, some of which are briefly outlined. Research limitations/implications-This is primarily a conceptual paper that suggests a range of practical responses. For example, re-purposing parts of the current information technology (IT) infrastructure away from financial and economic indices to those tracking the health of the planet. Also translating the case put forward here for a new generation of Institutions of Foresight (IoFs) into real-world start-ups and examples. Further research is needed into the uses and limitation, both of positive and negative views of futures. It is suggested that the latter have more value than is commonly realised. Practical implications-In addition to those stated above, the practical implications include new uses for IT infrastructure based on worldcentric-rather than financial and economic worldviews; designing and implementing a new generation of IoFs; and finding new ways to inform the public of impending Dystopian outcomes without exacerbating avoidance and depression. Social implications-The social implications are profound. Currently, humanity has allowed itself to “tune out” and ignore many of the well-founded “signals” (from the global system) and warnings (from those who have observed and tracked real-world changes). As a result, it has outgrown the capacity of the planet to support the current population, let alone the 10 billion currently projected by the United Nations (UN). Something must give. Applied foresight can provide essential lead time to act before human actions are overwhelmed by forces beyond its control. Originality/value-The paper draws together material from hitherto disparate sources to assess the LtG project. It also deploys key concepts from an integral perspective that shed new light on human and cultural forces that determine how people respond to the prospect of Dystopian futures. In so doing, it provides insight into why we are where we are and also into some of the means by which humanity can respond. Specifically, it suggests a shift from collapse narratives to those of descent. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Denialism; Descent pathways; Global emergency; Human and cultural interiors; Limits to growth; Trajectory of development",,,,,,"Ahmed, N., ), “NASA-funded study: Industrial civilisation headed for ‘irreversible collapse?’ Earth Insight (2014) The Guardian, , www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists, 14 March, accessed 15 March 2014; Atkisson, A., (1999) Believing Cassandra, , Scribe, Melbourne; Bageant, J., (2011) Walzing at the Doomsday Ball, , Scribe, Melbourne; Bardi, U., (2011) The Limits to Growth Revisited, , Springer, New York, NY; Beck, D., (1996) C.

Because of this, safety professionals need to recognize sources of hazardous building materials (HBM) that present an occupational health or environmental risk. This paper introduces the safety professional to common building materials encountered during demolition operations that may present an occupational health or environmental risk because of their toxicity, and, if not recognized and managed properly, may result in injury, illness or environmental damage. This paper discusses identification of toxic building materials that are sources of risk during demolition operations and introduces common best management practices to mitigate risk to workers and to prevent damage to the environment. This paper looks beyond the typically recognized lead-based paint, asbestos insulation and mold to the more elusive hazardous building materials, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, toxic metals and ionizing radiation. With proper planning and foresight, a great majority of the worker and environmental risks associated with the management of waste from a demolition project can be eliminated or mitigated.",,"Building materials; Damage detection; Demolition; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Health; Health hazards; Health risks; Human resource management; Industrial hygiene; Ionizing radiation; Paint; Painting; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Professional aspects; Toxic materials; Waste management; Best management practices; Demolition projects; Environmental aspects; Environmental damage; Management of wastes; Occupational health; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Safety professionals; Occupational risks",,,,,"(1980) Toxicity Characteristic, Table 1 - Maximum Concentration of Contaminants for the Toxicity Characteristic, , http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?SID=47ebaf3b8642ee5939e5667c4e2156e6&node=40:27.0.1.1.2.3&rgn=div6, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR 261.24 (retrieved March 6, 2014); (1980) Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention in Certain Residential Structures, , http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?SID=2a9b342dcec34c0e2d7dcc47b9733176&node=40:32.0.1.1.14&rgn=div5, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 745, retrieved March 6, 2014; (2000) Protocols for Conducting Environmental Compliance Audits of Facilities with PCBs, Asbestos, and Lead-Based Paint Regulated under TSCA, , http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/policies/incentives/auditing/apcol-tsca.pdf, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2005) Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste, , http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title40-vol27/xml/CFR-2012-title40-vol27-part261.xml, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 261, (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2005) Toxic Substances Control Act Asbestos, , http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?SID=2a9b342dcec34c0e2d7dcc47b9733176&node=40:32.0.1.1.19&rgn=div5, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 40 CFR Part 763 (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2009) Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Processing, Distribution in Commerce, and Use Prohibitions, , http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?SID=2a9b342dcec34c0e2d7dcc47b9733176&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr761_main_02.tpl, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 40 CFR Part 761 (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2014) PCBs in Caulk in Older Buildings, , http://www.epa.gov/pcbsincaulk/, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (retrieved March 6, 2014); Goffredi, R., (2007) McCoy's RCRA Unraveled, , Lakewood, CO: McCoy and Associates, Inc; (1996) Inorganic Arsenic, , https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10890, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR Part 1926.1118 (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2006), https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10629, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR Part 1926.55 App A, Gases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2012) Asbestos, , https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10862, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR Part 1926.1101, retrieved March 6, 2014; (2012) Cadmium, , https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10891, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR Part 1926.1127 (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2012) Chromium (VI), , https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=13117, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR Part 1926.1126 (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2012) Lead, , https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10641, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR Part 1926.62, (retrieved March 6, 2014); (1999) Recommended Management Practices for the Removal of Hazardous Materials from Buildings Prior to Demolition, , http://www.dep.state.fl.us/waste/quick_topics/publications/shw/hazardous/fact/c&dwaste.pdf, University of Florida Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences (retrieved March 6, 2014); (2011) Lead - Soft and Easy to Cast, , http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3045/pdf/fs2011-3045.pdf, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (retrieved March 6, 2014)",,,,"American Society of Safety Engineers","ASSE Professional Development Conference and Exposition 2014","8 June 2014 through 11 June 2014",,138163,,,,,"English","ASSE Prof. Dev.

He accepts, with equal enthusiasm, Aristotelian teleology, according to which each part of an organism is oriented toward an end (telos) – namely, the life proper to that organism. For Galen, every part of the human body has been created “so that it would not have been better had it come into being differently”. His monumental hymn to Nature, On the Usefulness of Parts, is nothing less than an attempt to prove this claim. Throughout his vast corpus of writings Galen is passionately committed to the intelligence of Nature and the boundless foresight with which “she” enables us to live and thrive. Yet, at the same time, Galen did not believe that the Demiurge had created a perfect world. In a well-known critique of the God of Moses, one that echoes the Timaeus, he emphasizes that the Demiurge achieves the best results he can, given the material conditions under which he has to work. These conditions mean, among other things, that the organism’s continued survival is never guaranteed in advance. It is always, rather, only a likely outcome, and therefore firmly grounded in the domain of probabilities. As it turns out, there are many ways in which things can go wrong. To the extent that Galen was, first and foremost, a physician, he was exceptionally well acquainted with the malfunctioning of the human organism. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,"Best possible world (1989) Timaeus; (2007) Timaeus; UP, 1 (5); UP, 11 (14); Prop, 13; Nat, 1 (12); Nat, 1 (12); Foet, 6 (2); PHP, 9 (8-4); Nat, 3 (3); Nat, 2 (6); Nat, 2 (6); Nat, 3 (15); Nat, 1 (2); Nat, 1 (4); Nat, 2 (3); Foet, 5, pp. 8-10; Foet, 6 (31); Prop, (15); Nat, 1 (1); De An, 414a, pp. 32-42; Nat, 1 (12); Nat, 2 (6); Nat, 1 (13); Nat, 1 (14); Nat, 3 (13); Nat, 1 (15); Nat, 2 (9); Nat, 2 (8); Nat, 3 (13); Nat, 3 (8)","Holmes, B.; Department of Classics, Princeton UniversityUnited States",,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107279551; 9781107050495,,,"English","Probabilities, Hypotheticals, and Counterfactuals in Anc.

Accurate forecasting is a great help for companies in making the best decisions in terms of unit commitment, production, and maintenance planning. It is necessary for the companies to have prior foresight of future demand with adequate accuracy. Some data mining algorithms play the greatest role in predicting the demand forecasting. As a regular data-driven method, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are popular in energy forecasting. This paper investigated the application of the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a forecasting tool for predicting the energy demand in Turkey. The benefit of the proposed model is forecasting energy needs through the evaluation of ANFIS application using data sets processed with principle component analysis (PCA) and collected from the energy forecast shootout (EFS) and Ministry of Natural Resources Turkey. The results showed that the hybrid ANFIS model based upon fuzzy logic (FL) and ANN performed efficiently in term of forecast accuracy. Thus, it could be regarded as an alternative method in energy forecasting. Finally, the application of ANFIS in a long term energy forecasting was provided, and the results were interpreted.

The goal of the project is to develop web based tools which automatically detect activity and trends regarding given keywords. This knowledge can be used to enable decision makers to react proactively to arising challenges. As for now we can detect trends worldwide in more than 60 languages and assign these trends accordingly to over 100 national states. To reach this goal we utilize the big search engines as their core competence is to determine the relevance of a document regarding the search query. The search engines allows slicing of the results by language and country. In the next step we download some of the proposed documents for analysis. Because of the amount of information required we reach the field of Big Data. Therefore an extra effort is made to ensure scalability of the application. We introduce a new approach to activity and trend detection by combining the data collection and detection methods. To finally detect trends in the gathered data we use data mining methods which allow us to be independent from the language a document is written in. The input of these methods is the text data of the downloaded documents and a specially prepared index structure containing meta data and various other information which accumulate during the collection of the documents. We show that we can reliably detect trends and activities in highly active topics and discuss future research. © Jan Stutzki.","Information retrieval; Trend detection; Web mining","Data mining; Information retrieval; Search engines; Amount of information; Core competence; Data collection; Data mining methods; Decision makers; Detection methods; Trend detection; Web Mining; Big data",,,,,"Wangberg, S.C., Relations between Internet use, socio-economic status (SES), social support and subjective health (2008) Health Promotion International, 23 (1), pp. 70-77; (2011) Internet World Stats, , Miniwatts Marketing Group. 31 May, accessed 16 April 2014; Manning, C.D., Raghavan, P., Schütze, H., (2008) Introduction to Information Retrieval, , Cambridge university press Cambridge, USA; Sun, Y., Zhuang, Z., Lee, G.C., A large-scale study of robots.

Starting from the premise that such IS are part of socio-technical systems, the interaction between technology and human actors raise ethical concerns. Early recognition of these concerns can address ethical issues and improve the use of the technology for a range of social and organisational goals. This paper discusses research conducted in two futures research projects. Both projects investigated emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) and ethics. The first project established approaches for identifying future technologies and their related ethical concerns. This led to the identification of 11 emerging ICTs and their associated ethical concerns. The second project took these general ethical concerns and focused on their role in IS. Specifically, how IS professionals view future emerging technologies, their associated ethical concerns, and how they think these concerns could be addressed. The key findings are that IS professionals are primarily interested in the job at hand and less so in the ethical concerns that the job might bring; ethics is a concern that is best left for others to deal with.

However, key definitions of SI support quite different approaches; a report published by the Royal Society (Baulcombe et al., 2009) favours the land sparing model whilst a Foresight report (2011) favours land sharing. SI will require pragmatic and innovative policies, including further revision of the Environmental Stewardship Scheme and the development of landscape-scale governance within an over-arching strategic approach to planning. However, its innovation is its focus on unlocking the social at the expense of the private value of land (at those locations where non-market ecosystem services have a higher value than marketable agricultural products). Though scientific advances may help raise production efficiency through a better understanding of the trade-offs between agricultural production and ecosystem service provision, issues related to who controls the use of land will be the most difficult to resolve, which suggests a role for Boundary Organisational Theory (BOT) because of the insights this theory lends to negotiating complex problems. Within BOT terminology SI can be considered a ""boundary object"" about which stakeholders are able to negotiate site-specific issues to incrementally arrive at solutions which draw on the full range of land sharing and land sparing options and so avoid prescriptive approaches and technologies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agri-environment; Boundary object; Land sharing; Land sparing; Land use","agricultural intensification; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; ecosystem service; farming system; land use; United Kingdom",,,,,"(2012), http://www.theccc.org.uk, Adaptation sub-Committee Progres Report, Climate change - is the UK prepareing for flooding and water scarcity?

This theory is still accepted. We present several arguments that via negativa should discard the compensatory theory. (1) Current theory is anthropocentric; it ignores other species and their analog structures. (2) Arterial pathologies are diseases of old age, appearing after gene propagation. (3) According to the current theory, evolution has foresight. (4) Its commonness among animals indicates that it is probably a convergent evolutionary structure. (5) It was observed that communicating arteries are too small for effective blood flow, and (6) missing or hypoplastic in the majority of the population. We infer that CW, under physiologic conditions, serves as a passive pressure dissipating system; without considerable blood flow, pressure is transferred from the high to low pressure end, the latter being another arterial component of CW. Pressure gradient exists because pulse wave and blood flow arrive into the skull through different cerebral arteries asynchronously, due to arterial tree asymmetry. Therefore, CW and its communicating arteries protect cerebral artery and blood-brain barrier from hemodynamic stress. © 2014 ISCBFM All rights reserved.","Atherosclerosis; Cerebrovascular disease; Comparative anatomy;

The study compares an optimal economic allocation for groundwater use subject to streamflow constraints, achieved by a central planner with perfect foresight, with a uniform tax on groundwater use and a uniform quota on groundwater use. The policies are compared with two modeling approaches, the Optimal Control Model (OCM) and the Multi-Agent System Simulation (MASS). The economic decision models are coupled with a physically based representation of the aquifer using a calibrated MODFLOW groundwater model. The results indicate that uniformly applied policies perform poorly when simulated with more realistic, heterogeneous, myopic, and self-interested agents. In particular, the effects of the physical heterogeneity of the basin and the agents undercut the perceived benefits of policy instruments assessed with simple, single-cell groundwater modeling. This study demonstrates the results of coupling realistic hydrogeology and human behavior models to assess groundwater management policies. The Republican River Basin, which overlies a portion of the Ogallala aquifer in the High Plains of the United States, is used as a case study for this analysis. Key Points Detailed physical model was necessary to properly investigate policy instruments Agent heterogeneity significantly affects policy instrument effectiveness Both policy instruments benefit from a weighted system or an adaptive system © 2014.

Design/methodology/approach - We are using a case study approach to assess both the type of strategic leadership being offered and the public governance issues faced by Liverpool City. Findings - In terms of leadership, the mayor fitted what we describe in the paper as the pragmatic type of strategic leader (long-term perspective providing foresight, and inclusiveness in formulating strategy and plans). The directly elected mayoral system seemed to have a number of advantages, perhaps the key one being that the mayor, acted for the entire city, rather than being the leader of the city council as he was before. New channels of social dialogue had been opened up, especially with the business community. The major difficulties in governance were the overstretched entrepreneurial and strategic capacity of the centre of the council and a lack of coherence in terms of multi-level governance. Social implications - The approach to public leadership in Liverpool represents a major break from the past; it was a widening of political inclusiveness to embrace people with a range of political perspectives. It was also a major break from the past in terms of building good relations between public leaders and business leaders. The prize was economic regeneration to create a better platform for social and economic inclusiveness. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Multi-level governance; Public governance; Social dialogue; Strategic capacity; Strategic leadership",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., (1987) Corporate Strategy, , London: Penguin; Barber, M., (2007) Instruction to Deliver, , London: Politico’s; (2020), European Commission.

Design/methodology/approach – The article is based on reflections on contributions to the recently published book “The Added Value of Facilities Management” and related future studies, as well as further exploration of five main themes. Findings – Added value is expected to be central in the future development of FM, which is confirmed by recent foresight studies. There is a need for a better understanding of alignment between FM and core business, performance measurement methods and how models such as the FM Value Map can be of value to the involved stakeholders. Corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability and branding have great potential to add value and to elevate FM to become a strategic partner with corporate top management. Management of stakeholders’ perception of value and relationships are essential aspects as well and need further attention. Research limitations/implications – The article is based on the conclusions of several studies that aimed to explore items for further research, on the ideas of all co-authors of “The Added Value of Facilities Management” anthology and on further exploration of five main themes, and not on an extensive review of recommendations for further research to be found in a huge number of research reports. Practical implications – The findings and ideas for further research on the added value of FM deliver input to further professionalization of FM. Originality/value – This paper provides important input to the future research agenda on the added value of FM and sheds new light on five particular research topics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Facilities management; FM Value Map; Stakeholders; Strategic management; Sustainable development; Value added",,,,,,"Alexander, K., Co-creation of value in FM (2012) Managing Organizational Ecologies-Space, Management, and Organizations, , in Alexander, K. and Price, I, Taylor&Francis, New York, NY; Appel-Meulenbroek, H., Havermans, D., Janssen, I.I., Kempen, A., Corporate branding: An exploration of the influence of CRE (2010) Journal of Corporate Real Estate, 12 (1), pp. 47-59; Balmer, J., Gray, E.R., Corporate identity and corporate communications: Creating a competitive advantage (2000) Industrial and Commercial Training, 32 (7), pp. 256-262; Becker, F.D., Quinn, K.L., Rappaport, A.J., Sims, W.R., (1994) Implementing Innovative Workplaces-Organizational Implications of Different Strategies, , Ithaca, Cornell International Workplace Studies Program, New York; Bruhn, M., Georgi, D., Services Marketing-Managing the Service Value Chain (2006) Pearson Education, , Harlow; CEN, (2006) Facility Management-Part 1: Terms and Definitions, , European Standard EN 15221-1, European Committee for Standardization, Brussels; Coenen, C., Alexander, K., Kok, H., FM as a value network: Exploring relationships amongst key FM stakeholders (2012) The Added Value of Facilities Management: Concept, Findings and Perspectives, pp. 75-91. , in Jensen, P., van der Voordt, T. and Coenen, C, Centre for Facilities Management-Realdania Research, DTU Management Engineering, Polyteknisk Forlag, Lyngby, Denmark; Coenen, C., Von Felten, D., Waldburger, D., Beyond financial performance: Capturing relationship value in FM (2012) The Added Value of Facilities Management: Concept, Findings and Perspectives, pp. 105-122. , in Jensen, P., van der Voordt, T. and Coenen, C, Centre for Facilities Management-Realdania Research, DTU Management Engineering, Polyteknisk Forlag, Lyngby, Denmark; Cui, Y., (2013) Relationship Value in Fm-A Customer Perspective, , MSc-thesis, Institute of Facility Management, Zurich University of Applied Sciences; De Jonge, H., De ontwikkeling van corporate real estate management (2002) Real Estate Magazine, 22 (5), pp. 8-12; De Vries, J., De Jonge, H., Van Der Voordt, D., Impact of real estate interventions on organisational performance (2008) Journal of Corporate Real Estate, 10 (3), pp. 208-223; Den Heijer, A., (2011) Managing the University Campus-Information to Support Real Estate Decisions, , PhD thesis, Eburon Academic Publishers, Delft; Ellison, I., Flowers, J., Ecologies in existence: Boundaries, relationships and dominant narratives (2012) Managing Organizational Ecologies-Space, Management, and Organizations, , in Alexander, K. and Price, I, Taylor & Francis, New York, NY; Falkenbach, H., Lindholm, A.L., Schleich, H., Environmental sustainability: Drivers for the real estate investor (2010) Journal of Real Estate Literature, 18 (2), pp. 203-223; Fuerst, F., Patrick, M.P., New Evidence on the Green Building Rent and Price Premium (2009) Paper Presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Real Estate Society, , 3 April 2009, Monterey, California; Hinks, J., Lopinksi, R., Hendricks, L., (2012) Customer Service, pp. 18-20. , in Hinks, J., Varcoe, B. and the Zurich CRE&FM team (2012): CRE&FM Futures Forum.

A long-term view including the mineral-energy nexus is deemed to be necessary (although not sufficient) for managing future resource constraints and energy transitions. Alarmingly, it identifies that the future of minerals resources and production is generally viewed only 5-10 years ahead rather than several decades or more as for energy. Additionally, the sectors are generally studied independently, rather than with a focus on the nexus. With these findings as evidence of an unaddressed problem, the paper then focusses on the current forces for change in the minerals industry: namely community drivers regarding social licence to operate, new technologies and consumer and government drivers on responsible minerals. As discussions of sustainable development become displaced by the emerging discourse of 'responsible' minerals, what is adopted and discarded? Whilst responsible minerals considers chain-of-custody, it does not adopt a long-term view and overlooks the mineral-energy nexus. Using three illustrative cases at the nexus of (i) rare earths-renewables, (ii) coal-steel and (iii) uranium-nuclear we extend the theoretical discussion on 'responsible' with a range of contemporary examples from the perspectives of producing (Australia) and consuming countries (Japan, Switzerland) and propose a research agenda for an expanded notion of responsible minerals which recognises the complexity of the mineral-energy nexus and connects it to progressing sustainable futures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A crucial difference between human and non-human planning may relate to the diversity of domains and needs in which this skill is expressed. Although great apes can save tools for future use, there is little evidence yet that they can also do so in other contexts. To investigate this question further, we presented the apes with a planning token-exchange task that differed from standard tool-use tasks. Additionally, we manipulated the future outcome of the task to investigate planning flexibility. In the Exchange condition, subjects had to collect, save and transport tokens because they would need them 30 min later to exchange them for food with a human, i.e., “bring-back” response. In the Release condition, the collection and transport of tokens were not needed as no exchange took place after 30 min. Out of 13 subjects, eight solved the task at least once in the Exchange condition, with chimpanzees appearing less successful than the other species. Importantly, three individuals showed a clear differential response between conditions by producing more “bring-back” responses in the Exchange than in the Release conditions. Those bonobo and orangutan individuals hence adapted their planning behavior according to changing needs (i.e., they brought tokens back significantly more often when they would need them). Bonobos and orangutans, unlike chimpanzees, planned outside the context of tool-use, thus challenging the idea that planning in these species is purely domain-specific. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anticipation; Foresight; Future planning; Non-human primate; Token exchange","animal; anticipation; female; forecasting; male; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Pongo abelii; psychology; reinforcement; Animals; Anticipation, Psychological; Female; Forecasting; Male; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Pongo abelii; Token Economy; Animalia; Hominidae; Pan; Pan paniscus; Pongo pygmaeus; Primates",,,,,"Anderson, J.M., Hattori, Y., Fujita, K., Quality before quantity: rapid learning of reverse-reward contingency by capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) (2008) J Comp Psychol, 122, pp. 445-448. , PID: 19014269; Bar, M., The proactive brain: using analogies and associations to generate predictions (2007) Trends Cogn Sci, 11, pp. 280-289. , PID: 17548232; Boesch, C., Social grouping in Tai’chimpanzees (1996) Great, pp. 101-113. , McGrew WC, Marchant LF, Nishida T, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Ape Societies; Bourjade, M., Thierry, B., Call, J., Dufour, V., Are monkeys able to plan for future exchange?

There is a need for a better understanding of alignment between FM and core business, performance measurement methods and how models such as the FM Value Map can be of value to the involved stakeholders. Corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability and branding have great potential to add value and to elevate FM to become a strategic partner with corporate top management. Management of stakeholders’ perception of value and relationships are essential aspects as well and need further attention.Research limitations/implications – The article is based on the conclusions of several studies that aimed to explore items for further research, on the ideas of all co-authors of “The Added Value of Facilities Management” anthology and on further exploration of five main themes, and not on an extensive review of recommendations for further research to be found in a huge number of research reports.Practical implications – The findings and ideas for further research on the added value of FM deliver input to further professionalization of FM.Originality/value – This paper provides important input to the future research agenda on the added value of FM and sheds new light on five particular research topics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Facilities management; Stakeholders; Strategic management; Sustainable development",,,,,,"Alexander, K., Co-creation of value in FM (2012) Managing Organizational Ecologies - Space, Management, and Organizations, , in Alexander, K. and Price, I, Taylor&Francis, New York, NY; Appel-Meulenbroek, H., Havermans, D., Janssen, I.I., Kempen, A., Corporate branding: An exploration of the influence of CRE (2010) Journal of Corporate Real Estate, 12 (1), pp. 47-59; Balmer, J., Gray, E.R., Corporate identity and corporate communications: Creating a competitive advantage (2000) Industrial and Commercial Training, 32 (7), pp. 256-262; Becker, F.D., Quinn, K.L., Rappaport, A.J., Sims, W.R., (1994) Implementing Innovative Workplaces – Organizational Implications of Different Strategies, , Cornell International Workplace Studies Program, New York; Bruhn, M., Georgi, D., (2006) Services Marketing – Managing the Service Value Chain, , Pearson Education, Harlow; (2006) Facility Management – Part 1: Terms and Definitions, , CEN, European Standard EN 15221-1, European Committee for Standardization, Brussels; Coenen, C., Alexander, K., Kok, H., FM as a value network: Exploring relationships amongst key FM stakeholders (2012) The  Added Value of Facilities Management: Concept, Findings and Perspectives.

However, bringing down household consumption is no easy task, even if, as we have seen throughout this special issue, there are incentives that can be deployed. As a helpful complement to the various analyses that have come out of the study ""Producing and Consuming in the Era of Ecological Transition"", this article by Éric Vidalenc, Laurent Meunier and Claire Pinet presents the results of a very recent foresight study carried out by ADEME, the French Environment and Energy Management Agency, on consumption in France to 2030, with a view to reducing its environmental impact. The authors remind us of the continuous progression of consumption in France since 1960 and the serious impact this has had on the environment. They go on to describe in detail the scenario that AOEME's researchers arrived at with an eye to reducing the environmental footprint of French consumption by 2030. They stress, for example, the levers that could be used to this end (reducing food waste, increasing the lifespan of capital goods, new mobility services etc.), alongside the quantitative outcomes such a proactive scenario could produce. As we can see, there is scope to change existing patterns of consumption, but there is much still to do to activate the key levers and make really systemic changes over the next 15 years.",,,,,,,"(2014) Contribution de TADEME à l'Élaboration de Visions Énergétiques 2030-2050, , http://www.ademe.fr/sites/default/files/assets/documents/20140519_scenarios-2030-2050-synthese.pdf, Paris: ADEME, Consulté le 24 septembre 2014; (2013) L'Évaluation Macroéconomique des Visions Énergétiques 2030-2050 de L'ADEME.

However, the factors that influence patients' (or residents') adoption to use telehealth remain unclear. The purpose of the study is to integrate extended technology acceptance model (Extended TAM) and health belief model (HBM) to develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing the interaction of trust factors, technological factors, and health belief factors in telehealth. The proposed framework is validated with 365 respondents from Nantou County, which is located in central Taiwan. The findings show that each patient trust factors (social trust and institutional trust) has significantly positive effects on the technological factors (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness separately), which in turn influence usage intention. This study also confirms that the technological factors are important mediators between trust factors and usage intention. In addition, health belief factors (perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action) are also critical direct factors affecting usage intention. In other words, trust, technology, health belief aspects will affect simultaneously behavioral intention. According to the statistical results, the proposed model fits very well for the samples. The findings of the integrative model may be used as a theoretical basis for future research and can also offer empirical foresight to the executives and managers of hospitals when they initially introduce and promote the telehealth into their surrounding community. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Health Belief Model;

The present study was designed to develop methods for analyzing physician resources in various areas.Conclusion: The method developed in the present study provides a useful approach for estimating medical practitioner resources using the prefectural Medical Information Net and National Confirmation System. However, the method has some limitations because of missing data in the registries and lack of information regarding physicians who are not administrators.Methods: Data on clinic administrators, including their names, ages, and clinical departments, were collected using the Medical Information Net of Nara Prefecture, whereas the National Confirmation System was used to collect information on medical doctors. The data were classified into 3 groups according to the physicians' ages: <65, 66-75, and ≥76 years old. The mean number of departments was calculated and the data was represented schematically according to each group and municipality.Results: Six hundred one doctors (77.6%) were identified from 774 clinics, excluding overlapping data Among these, 491 doctors (81.7%) were correctly registered according to the registration year. Three hundred seventy-one doctors (72.5%) were registered in 1961 and later; these doctors were assumed to be <76 years old. Three hundred seventy-one doctors (58.4%) were registered in 1971 and later, while 247 were registered (31.6%) in 1981 and later. The number of medical practitioners per 100,000 people increased in a few municipalities, which was mainly attributable to a decrease in the population size.","Health care system; Medical Information Net; Medical practitioner; Municipality; National Confirmation System","accident; Article; human; incidence; Japan; major clinical study; scoring system; slip and fall; ward",,,,,"https://www.qq.prelnarajp/(2012.8.12; https://licenseif.mhlw.go.jp/search, 2012.8.12","Onishi, J.; Department of Community Comprehensive Care and Geriatrics, Mie UniversityJapan",,,"Nara Medical Association",,,,,13450069,,JNMAF,,"Japanese","J.

Yet software failure today continues to plague both the systems and the organizations that develop them resulting in the loss of life, time, money, and valuable system platforms. A starship cannot afford this type of software failure in long journeys away from home. A single software failure could have catastrophic results for the spaceship and the crew onboard. This paper will offer a new approach to developing safe reliable software systems through focusing not on the traditional safety/reliability engineering paradigms but rather by focusing on a new paradigm: Resilience and Failure Obviation Engineering. The foremost objective of this approach is the obviation of failure, coupled with the ability of a software system to prevent or adapt to complex changing conditions in real time as a safety valve should failure occur to ensure safe system continuity. Through this approach, safety is ensured through foresight to anticipate failure and to adapt to risk in real time before failure occurs. In a starship, this type of software engineering is vital. Through software developed in a resilient manner, a starship would have reduced or eliminated software failure, and would have the ability to rapidly adapt should a software system become unstable or unsafe. As a result, long term software safety, reliability, and resilience would be present for a successful long term starship mission.","Failure obviation; Reliability; Resilience; Safety; Software; Software engineering; Software fragility","Accident prevention; Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Reliability; Software engineering; Software reliability; Spacecraft; Aerospace software; Resilience; Resilience engineerings; Safety-critical software systems; Software failure; Software safety; Software systems; System platforms; Safety engineering",,,,,"Naur, P., Randell, B., (1969) Software Engineering (Report on a Conference Sponsored by The, NATO, Science Committee, Garmisch, Germany, 7th to 11th October 1968), , Scientific Affairs Division, NATO; (1965) Mariner-Venus 1962 Final Report, , NASA NASA SP-59; (2011) Magellan Mission to Venus, , www2.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan, Last Accessed 15 August; (2011) Magellan Mission to Venus, , http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/magellan.html, Last Accessed 18 August; (2011) The Clementine Mission, , www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/clementine/clementine.html, Last Accessed 6 August; Smith, B., Pathfinder team identifies glitch (1997) Aviation Week and Space Technology, 147, p. 24; (2013) Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board Phase I Report, , ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/reports/1999/MCO_report.pdf, Last Accessed 6 June; (2013) Report on the Loss of the Mars Polar Lander and Deep Space 2 Missions, , www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/Mars/mpl_report.pdf, NASA JPL Last Accessed 6 June; Domheim, M., Ready to roll (2004) Aviation Week and Space Technology, 160, p. 33; (2013) Mars Global Surveyor Spacecraft Loss of Contact, , www.nasa.gov/pdf/174244main_mgs_white_paper_20070413.pdf, Last Accessed 6 June; Joy, B., Kennedy, K., (1999) Executive Office of the President of the United States, President's Information Technology Advisory Committee Report to the President, Information Technology Research: Investing in Our Future, p. 28. , February; Australian Transportation Safety Board, Aviation Occurrence Investigation AO-2008-070, October2008; (2011) Report of the Crash of An American Boeing 757, , www.sozogaku.com/fkd/en/cfen/CAI000293.html, Hatamura Institute for the Advancement of Technology Last Accessed 21 July; Perrow, C., (1984) Normal Accidents: Living with High Risk Technologies, , Basic Books, New York; Hollnagel, E., Woods, D., Prologue: Resilience engineering concepts (2006) Resilience Engineering: Concepts and Precepts, , E.

The simultaneous offering of Managed Service has been proposed as an efficient way to support quality of service, to make some applications feasible and many others more attractive, and give consumers greater choice. However, there is widespread concern that if a network provider is allowed to offer Managed Service and charge a per-use fee, then the network provider will find it in its short-term profit-maximizing interest to degrade the Best Effort service. Not only will consumers then face higher costs, but also fewer innovations and new applications will be created. To investigate these issues, we formulate a model in which the provider myopically maximizes its profit by setting the per-use fee and deciding on the bandwidth to provision for the Best Effort and Managed Services. We show that in the optimal solution the service offering is binary, i.e., either the Best Service or the Managed Service is offered, but not both simultaneously. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition gives the optimal service offering. Combining this condition with a birth-and-death model of applications, we identify a natural attractor around which the application creation process makes the service offering stable. Our finding alleviates the concern about the Managed Service. Still, the provider needs tow have foresight and the regulator needs to be vigilant, since we also show that there is a threshold number of applications belo which the stabilizing mechanism loses its effectiveness and myopic profit-maximization results in a shrinking network and application pool, which hurts both the provider and consumers. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Profitability; Quality of service; Best effort services; Birth-and-death model; Creation process; Network provider; New applications; Optimal solutions; Service offering; Threshold numbers; Internet",,,,,"Economides, N., Hermalin, B., The Economics of network neutrality (2012) RAND Journal of Economics, 43 (4), p. 602629. , Winter; Faulhaber, G., Farber, D., The Open internet: A customer-centric framework (2010) International Journal of Communication, p. 4; Lee, R.S., Wu, T., Subsidizing creativity through network design: Zero-pricing and net neutrality (2009) The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 23 (3), pp. 61-76; Mitra, D., Wang, Q., A model-based study of the impact of managed services and the spawning of applications in broadband networks (2012) Proceedings of the 24th International Teletraffic Congress, Krakow Poland, , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2414321&dl=ACM&coll= DL&CFID=273265459&CFTOKEN=84726096, September; Peha, J., The benefits and risks of mandating network neutrality, and the quest for a balanced policy (2006) Proceedings of the 34th Telecommunications Policy Research Conference, , Arlington, VA, October; Sen, S., (2012) Pricing Data: A Look at Past Proposals, Current Plans, and Future Trends, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1201.4197",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops, INFOCOM WKSHPS 2014","27 April 2014 through 2 May 2014","Toronto, ON",106378,0743166X,9781479930883,PINFE,,"English","Proc IEEE INFOCOM",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904512074

This upward trend is doubtless not going to end, even if recurrent attempts to moderate it manage to restrict, to some extent, the proportion of this expenditure that is covered - and socialized-by sickness insurance, at the risk, as Jean-Claude Angoulvant reminds us here, of thwarting its social objectives. The very notion of health and the practices associated with it have been transformed by technical and societal developments, as Professor Andrg Khayat explains in this same issue. If we carry this logic to its extremes, as the present article shows, the current organization of care and its funding could be transformed into a genuine system of health ""production"" (in addition to remedy and prevention), capable of incorporating the changes at work (linked in particular to the evolution of health ""demand"", taken in an increasingly wide sense) and seeing us through a break with the old practices. In this context, Jean-Claude Angoulvant sketches a broad systemic vision built around the ""care pathway"" -which should, in his view, become a ""health pathway"". The idea involves bringing together the various strands of the ""health-care machinery"" -definition and content of health, practices and techniques, governance, regulation, funding etc.- and the related interconnections.

Unfortunately, in today's crisis conditions which favour a withdrawal into domestic concerns in many European countries, it is highly probable these elections will not stir up any great enthusiasm. However, after six decades, European construction has pretty well achieved what it set out to do in terms of economic development and bringing peace to the region. And great prospects of political, economic and social developments remain, which are capable of improving the lives of Europeans in the era of globalization. At any rate, it is this staunchly optimistic view the European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) has taken in a foresight study on Europe up to the year 2050 which is aimed at setting objectives, at various different levels of decision-making, for the territorial policies to be implemented on the continent. Philippe Ooucet and Jean-François Drevet, who took part in this study, here present the broad outlines of this happy vision of Europe in 2050 and the territorial dynamics at work within this timeframe (in terms of mobility, the residential economy, urban zones/rural zones, frontiers etc.), together with the possible developments in terms of territorial governance at the global, European, sub-regional, national and local levels.

Gas-fired generating units act as a link between the gas and electricity networks. The variability of wind power is, therefore, transferred to the gas network by influencing the gas demand for electricity generation. Operation of a GB integrated gas and electricity network considering the uncertainty in wind power forecast was investigated using three operational planning methods: deterministic, two-stage stochastic programming, and multistage stochastic programming. These methods were benchmarked against a perfect foresight model which has no uncertainty associated with the wind power forecast. In all the methods, thermal generators were controlled through an integrated unit commitment and economic dispatch algorithm that used mixed integer programming. The nonlinear characteristics of the gas network, including the gas flow along pipes and the operation of compressors, were taken into account and the resultant nonlinear problem was solved using successive linear programming. The operational strategies determined by the stochastic programming methods showed reductions of the operational costs compared to the solution of the deterministic method by almost 1%. Also, using the stochastic programming methods to schedule the thermal units was shown to make a better use of pumped storage plants to mitigate the variability and uncertainty of the net demand. © 2013 IEEE.","Integrated gas and electricity network; Stochastic programming; Wind power forecast uncertainty","Electricity networks; Mixed integer programming; Multi-stage stochastic programming; Nonlinear characteristics; Successive linear programming; Two-stage stochastic programming; Variability of wind power; Wind power forecast uncertainties; Electricity; Gases; Scheduling; Stochastic programming; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Gas compressors",,,,,"Carpentier, P., Cohen, G., Culioli, J.-C., Stochastic optimization of unit commitment: A new decomposition framework (1996) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 11 (2), pp. 1067-1073; Wang, J., Shahidehpour, M., Li, Z., Security-constrained unit commitment with volatile wind power generation (2008) IEEE Trans.

The settlement of the first fleet colony at Sydney was determined by its water assets with its sheltered and deep harbour and access to reliable freshwater for the soon to be burgeoning town. During the first 100 years of European settlement, the management of Sydney's water resources was characterised by minimal planning and arguably contempt for any regulatory regime, culminating in a pandemic of water borne diseases and pollution. From a perilous beginning beset by drought and disease, water management evolved over the next century to achieve what was at the time world's best practice in sanitary engineering and laying the foundation for the water systems that occur today. These achievements relied on a centralised approach, which solved water supply and sanitation issues but created a new set of environmental problems such as the discharge of diffuse water pollution into urban streams. As the city of Sydney moves into its third century, water management remains a critical issue for state and local government. This has occurred through the convergence of a range of social, political, climatic and environmental factors, each with their own separate but interrelated and overlapping agendas. Sydney still defines its essential character in terms of its harbour, beaches and waterways. If urban water management is to be a central foundation for a sustainable future for Sydney, reforms are needed and necessary. © 2013.","Catchment management; Land-use planning; Sydney; Water history; Water planning; Water policy","catchment; land use change; land use planning; local government; social change; sustainability; urban development; urban planning; water management; water planning; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]",,,,,"Aird, W.V., (1961) The Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage of Sydney, , Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board, Sydney; Andreen, W.L., The evolution of water pollution control in the United States - State, Local and Federal Efforts, 1789-1972: Part 1 (2003) Stanford Environmental Law Journal, 22, pp. 145-200; (1994) National Water Quality Management Strategy, Water Quality Management - An outline of the policies, April, , Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCAZ), Australian Water Association, Canberra; (1996) National Water Quality Management Strategy, , Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCAZ), Australian Water Association, Canberra; Barnard, M.A., (1980) History of Australia, , Angus and Robertson, Sydney, Australia; Bateman, B., Davies, P.J., Whiting, C., (1997) Regulation of Pollution in New South Wales - understanding the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, , Prospect Media, St. Leonards, Australia; Beasley, M., (1988) The sweat of their brows: 100 year of the Sydney Water Board, , Sydney Water Board, Sydney, Australia; Beder, S., (1989) Toxic Fish and Sewer Surfing - How Deceit and Collusion are Destroying Our Great Beaches, , Allen and Unwin, Australia; Birch, G.F., Taylor, S.E., The distribution and possible sources of organochlorine residues in sediments of a large urban estuary, Port Jackson, Sydney (2000) Australian Journal of Earth Sciences, 47, pp. 749-756; Burian, S.J., Nix, S.J., Durrans, S.R., Pit, R.E., Fan, C., Field, R., (1999), The historical development of wet weather flow management US EPA/600/JA-99/275; Bradsen, J., Biodiversity legislation: species, vegetation, habitats (1992) Environment and Planning Law Journal, 9, pp. 175-180; Brown, R.R., Impediments to integrated urban stormwater management: the need for institutional reform (2005) Environmental Management, 36, pp. 455-468; Brown, R.R., Davies, P.J., Understanding community receptivity to water re-use: Ku-ring-gai Council case study (2007) Water Science and Technology, 55 (4), pp. 283-290; Brown, R., Ashley, R., Farrelly, M., Political and professional agency entrapment: an agenda for urban water research (2011) Water Resources Management, 25, pp. 4037-4050; Canterbury City Council, (2009) History of Cooks River, , http://www.canterbury.nsw.gov.au/www/html/209-history-of-cooks-river.asp, (accessed 10.10.09); Cathcart, M., (2009) The Water Dreamers - the Remarkable History of Our Dry Continent, , Test Publishing Company, Australia; Chessman, B.C., Williams, S.A., Biodiversity and conservation of river macroinvertebrates (1999) Pacific Conservation Biology, 5, pp. 36-55; Clark, M., (1978) A Short History of Australia, , Penguin Publishing, Australia; Clark, D., Worse than physic: Sydney's water supply 1788-1888 (1978) Nineteenth-Century Sydney: Essays in Urban History, , Sydney University Press, Sydney, M.

Twenty intellectually high-functioning children with ASD (with a mean age of ~8 years) were compared to 20 sex, age, IQ, and language ability matched typically developing children on a series of tasks to assess spatial navigation, episodic memory, episodic future thinking (also known as episodic foresight or prospection), theory of mind (ToM), relational memory, and central coherence. This is the first study to explore these abilities concurrently within the same sample. Spatial navigation was assessed using the ""memory island"" task, which involves finding objects within a realistic, computer simulated, three-dimensional environment. Episodic memory and episodic future thinking were assessed using a past and future event description task. ToM was assessed using the ""animations"" task, in which children were asked to describe the interactions between two animated triangles. Relational memory was assessed using a recognition task involving memory for items (line drawings), patterned backgrounds, or combinations of items and backgrounds. Central coherence was assessed by exploring differences in performance across segmented and unsegmented versions of block design. Children with ASD were found to show impairments in spatial navigation, episodic memory, episodic future thinking, and central coherence, but not ToM or relational memory. Among children with ASD, spatial navigation was found to be significantly negatively related to the number of repetitive behaviors. In other words, children who showed more repetitive behaviors showed poorer spatial navigation. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed. © 2014 Lind, Bowler and Raber.","Autism spectrum disorder; Episodic future thinking; Episodic memory; Mental simulation; Scene construction; Self-projection; Spatial navigation; Theory of mind",,,,,,"Abell, F., Happe, F., Frith, U., Do triangles play tricks?

Recently, numerous extra osseous effects of vitamin D have been described, amongst them a positive effect on neuromuscular and cognitive functions. Several lines of evidence suggest that the beneficial effects of vitamin D on fall and fracture risk can be explained more by its action on the neuromuscular and cognitive functions than by its direct effect on bone metabolism. In this review, we first report on the relationships between vitamin D and osteoporotic fracture risk. Then, we present the data from the literature regarding the effects of vitamin D on risk factors such as fall risk and reduction in BMD, physical performance, and cognitive performance. Specific emphasis is put on the latter because there is evidence of a relationship between low concentration of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (the primary indicator of vitamin D status) and low cognitive abilities which have been shown to be a risk factor for falling. It can be further suggested that high risk of fracture in cognitively impaired adults could be explained by lower protective reaction when falling, which would result, for instance, from a lack of planning and foresight of the fall. Future studies are nonetheless needed to elucidate the associations between vitamin D and different risk factors, in particular the link between vitamin D and various cognitive functions. © 2014, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","Bone mineral density; Cognitive functions; Falls; Osteoporotic fractures; Physical performance; Vitamin D","25 hydroxyvitamin D; vitamin D; vitamin D; bone density; cognition; fall risk; falling; fragility fracture; human; muscle strength; physical performance; priority journal; Review; vitamin blood level; body equilibrium; drug effects; falling; Osteoporotic Fractures; prevention and control; risk factor; Accidental Falls; Bone Density; Cognition; Humans; Muscle Strength; Osteoporotic Fractures; Postural Balance; Risk Factors; Vitamin D",,"25 hydroxyvitamin D, 64719-49-9; Vitamin D",,,"Lieben, L., Carmeliet, G., Masuyama, R., Calcemic actions of vitamin D: effects on the intestine, kidney and bone (2011) Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab, 25, pp. 561-572. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXhtFSru7jO, PID: 21872798; Chapuy, M.C., Arlot, M., Duboeuf, F., Brun, J., Crouzet, B., Arnaud, S., Vitamin D<inf>3</inf> and calcium to prevent hip fractures in elderly women (1992) N Engl J Med, 327, pp. 1637-1642. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK3s%2FmtlSrug%3D%3D, PID: 1331788; Holick, M.F., Vitamin D, deficiency (2007) N Engl J Med, 357, pp. 266-281. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2sXotVejsbc%3D, PID: 17634462; Bouvard, B., Annweiler, C., Sallé, A., Beauchet, O., Chappard, D., Audran, M., Extraskeletal effects of vitamin D: facts, uncertainties, and controversies (2011) Jt Bone Spine, 78, pp. 10-16. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXmsFSlug%3D%3D; Segev-Jacubovski, O., Herman, T., Yogev-Seligmann, G., Mirelman, A., Giladi, N., Hausdorff, J.M., The interplay between gait, falls and cognition: can cognitive therapy reduce fall risk?

The public divided fairly evenly into two diametrically opposed groups, the first blaming the government (who initially responded by trying to shift blame to their expert advisors), attributing the mounting flood losses and prolonged misery to lack of investment in flood defences and river dredging. The second group blamed farmers for over-intensive agriculture in upstream catchments, inappropriate development in floodplains, and poor judgement on the part of the victims in choosing to live, work or farm in areas vulnerable to inundation. The floods resulted from a protracted sequence of deep, Atlantic depressions that followed a more southerly track than usual due to the position and configuration of the planetary jet stream. This prompted a second, no less polarised, scientific debate concerning whether the meteorological characteristics of the floods provided evidence that climate change has started to influence not only the probability of UK flooding, but also its nature, spatial distribution and duration. Both debates are intrinsically geographical, and this commentary sets out how understanding the geographies of flooding can help frame and inform them. This is addressed through consideration of these geographies, characterised as physical, rural, urban, social, economic and political. While an individual event (or even a sequence clustered of floods) cannot alone prove anything, the winter floods reinforce the conclusions of the Government's Flood Foresight study, which was commissioned in response to the 2000 (Millennium) Floods and updated following nationwide floods in summer 2007. © 2014 The Authors.

According to Causal Model Theory (Nestler et al. in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 34: 1043-1054, 2008), causal explanations are crucial for such hindsight distortions to occur. The present study provides further empirical support for this notion but extends previous findings in several ways. First, ecologically valid materials were used. Second, the effect of causal information on hindsight distortions was investigated in the realm of previously known events. Third, cross-cultural differences in reasoning (analytic vs. holistic) were taken into account. Specifically, German and Vietnamese participants in our study were presented with Wikipedia articles about the nuclear power plant in Fukushima Daiichi, Japan. They read either the version that existed before the nuclear disaster unfolded (Version 1) or the article that existed 8 weeks after the catastrophe commenced (Version 2). Only the latter contained elaborations on causal antecedents and therefore provided an explanation for the disaster. Reading that version led participants to perceive the nuclear disaster to be more likely inevitable and foreseeable when compared to reading Version 1. Cultural background did not exert a significant effect on these perceptions. Hence, hindsight distortions were obtained for ecologically valid materials even if the event was already known. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2014 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag.","Causal models; Cross-cultural comparisons; Hindsight bias; Wikipedia","article; causal modeling; comprehension; controlled study; critical thinking; cultural factor; ethnic difference; ethnic group; female; foreseeability; Fukushima nuclear accident; Germanic people; hindsight bias; human; human experiment; inevitability; male; online system; perception; priority journal; reading; reasoning; thinking; Vietnamese; adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; decision making; epidemiology; life event; online system; perception; physiology; probability; statistical bias; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Bias (Epidemiology); Causality; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Humans; Judgment; Life Change Events; Male; Online Systems; Perception; Probability; Reading; Young Adult",,,,,"Anderson, J.C., Jennings, M.M., Lowe, D.J., Reckers, P.M.J., The mitigation of hindsight bias in judges' evaluation of auditor decisions (1997) Audit J Pract Theory, 16, pp. 20-39; Arkes, H.R., Faust, D., Guilmette, T.J., Hart, K., Eliminating the hindsight bias (1988) J Appl Psychol, 73, pp. 305-307; Ash, I.K., Surprise, memory, and retrospective judgment making: Testing cognitive reconstruction theories of the hindsight bias effect (2009) J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn, 35, pp. 916-933; Blank, H., Nestler, S., Cognitive process models of hindsight bias (2007) Soc Cognit, 25, pp. 132-146; Blank, H., Nestler, S., Von, C.G., Fischer, V., How many hindsight biases are there?

We employ the integrated assessment Nordhaus DICE-2007 model (Nordhaus, A question of balance: economic modeling of global warming, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2008). Generally speaking, the framework is that of dynamic optimization of the discounted inter-temporal utility of consumption, taking into account the economic and the environmental dynamics. The main novelty is that several reasonable types of behavior (policy) of the economic agents, which may be non-optimal from the point of view of the global performance but are reasonable form an individual point of view and exist in reality, are strictly defined and analyzed. These include the concepts of ""business as usual"", in which an economic agent ignores her impact on the climate change (although adapting to it), and of ""free riding with a perfect foresight"", where some economic agents optimize in an adaptive way their individual performance expecting that the others would perform in a collectively optimal way. These policies are defined in a formal and unified way modifying ideas from the so-called ""model predictive control"". The introduced concepts are relevant to many other problems of dynamic optimization, especially in the context of resource economics. However, the numerical analysis in this paper is devoted to the evolution of the world economy and the average temperature in the next 150 years, depending on different scenarios for the behavior of the economic agents. In particular, the results show that the ""business as usual"", although adaptive to the change of the atmospheric temperature, may lead within 150 years to increase of temperature by 2°C more than the collectively optimal policy. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Dynamic optimization; Environmental economics; Global warming; Integrated assessment; Model predictive control; Optimal control",,,,,,"Allgöwer, F., Zheng, A., (2000) Nonlinear Model Predictive Control, 26. , Progress in systems theory, Basel: Birkhäuser; Bréchet, T., Eyckmans, J., Gerard, F., Marbaix, P., Tulkens, H., van Ypersele, J.-P., The impact of the unilateral EU commitment on the stability of international climate agreements (2010) Climate Policy, 10, pp. 148-166; Bréchet, T., Gerard, F., Tulkens, H., Efficiency vs. stability of climate coalitions: a conceptual and computational appraisal (2011) The Energy Journal, 32 (1), pp. 49-76; Bosetti, V., Carraro, C., De Cian, E., Duval, R., Massetti, E., Tavoni, M., (2009) The incentives to participate in, and the stability of, international climate coalitions: A game-theoretic analysis using the Witch model. 2009, , 064 Note di lavoro, FEEM; Carlson, D.A., Haurie, A.B., Leizarowitz, A., (1991) Infinite Horizon Optimal Control, , Berlin: Springer; Diehl, M., Bock, H.G., Schilder, J.P., Findeisen, R., Nagy, Z., Allgöwer, F., Real-time optimization and nonlinear model predictive control of processes governed by differential-algebraic equations (2002) Journal of Process Control, 12, pp. 577-585; Dontchev, A.L., Rockafellar, R.T., (2009) Implicit Functions and Solution Mappings.

Design/methodology/approach: First the authors define the potential changes in financial markets and then the tools available for the regulator to tame them. Finally, they build five scenarios according to the main evolutions observed on the financial markets and on the tools used by the regulator to modify these trends. Findings: Among the five scenarios defined, two present highly unstable features since the regulator refuses to choose between financial opening and independently determining how to regulate finance in order to preserve financial stability. Three of them achieve financial stability. However, they are more or less efficient or feasible. In terms of market efficiency, the multi-polar scenario is the best and the fragmentation scenario is the worst, since gains of integration depend on the size of the new capital market. Regarding sovereignty of regulation, fragmentation is the best scenario and the multi-polar scenario is the worst, because it necessitates coordination at the global level which implies moving further away from respective national preferences. However, the more realistic option seems to be the regionalisation scenario: this level of coordination seems much more realistic than the global one; the market should be of sufficient size to enjoy substantial benefits of integration. Nevertheless, the ""European government"" might gradually increase the degree of financial integration outside Europe in line with the degree of cooperation with the rest of the world. Originality/value: Foresight studies on financial markets and regulation are quite rare. This may be explained by the difficulty to forecast what will be their evolution in the coming decades, not least because finance is fundamentally unstable. This paper provides a framework to consider what could be the best strategy of regulators in such an unstable environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Financial integration; Financial stability; Supervision and regulation",,,,,,"Aglietta, M., (2011) Déséquilibres globaux et transformation du système monétaire international, , Confrontations Europe la revue, janvier-mars; Ali, A., Assessing stability of an economy: A scenario-based approach (2010) Proceedings of the Australian Centre for Financial Studies-Finsia Banking and Finance Conference, June; (2009) The role of macro-prudential policy, , Bank of England, Discussion Paper, November; Global imbalances and financial stability (2011) Financial Stability Review, (15). , Banque de France, February; Brunnermeier, M.K., Crockett, A., Goodhart, C., Persaud, A., Shin, H.S., (2009) The Fundamental Principles of Financial Regulation, , Geneva Report on the World Economy, No.11; (2010) Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010, , CFTC-SEC, Report of the Staffs of the CFTC and SEC to the Joint Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues, September 30; de Grauwe, P., (2010) The financial crisis and the future of the Eurozone, , BEEP briefing no. 21, December; Engstler, M., Welsch, R., (2008) Banks & Future Preparing for the Scenario 2015, , The European Foresight Monitoring Network; (2009) The Future of Finance: Driving Business Value Through the Performance of the Finance Function, , Young & Ernst; Goodhart, C., (2010) The role of macro-prudential supervision, , paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 2010 Financial Markets Conference: Up from the Ashes: The Financial System after the Crisis, Atlanta, GA, May 12; Goodhart, C., Lastra, R., Border problems (2010) Journal of International Economic Law, 13 (3), pp. 705-718. , 1 September; Igan, D., Mishra, P., Tressel, T., (2009) A fistful of dollars: Lobbying and the financial crisis, , IMF working paper 09/287, Washington, DC; (2010) Islamic Finance 2010, , International Financial Services London, January, IFSL Research; (2008) Finance of the Future: Looking Forward to 2020, , KPMG, Financial Management Advisory; Larosière, J., (2009) The High Level Group on Supervision in the European Union, , Report, February, European Commission, Brussels; Lietaer, B., (2008) Monnaies régionales: Des Nouvelles Voies Vers Une prospérité Durable, , Charles Leopold Mayer, Paris; Obstfeld, M., Rogoff, K., (2009) Global imbalances and the financial crisis: Products of common causes, , CEPR discussion paper, no. 7606; Perlas, N., (2000) Shaping Globalization: Civil Society, Cultural Power and Threefolding, , New Society Publisher, Gabriola Island, BC; Plihon, D., Global regulation in the aftermath of the subprime crisis (2010) Corporate Social Responsability: From Compliance to Opportunity?, , Les Editions de l'Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau; (2010) The Future of Financial Services, , PriceWaterHouseCoopers, London; Schoenmaker, D., The financial trilemma (2011) Economics Letters, 111 (1), pp. 57-59. , April; Svetlova, E., Talking about the crisis: Performance of forecasting in financial markets (2012) Culture and Organization, 18 (2), pp. 155-169; (2009) Financial System A Near-Term Outlook and Long-Term Scenarios, , World Economic Forum, World Economic Forum USA, New York, NY","Gossé, J.-B.; Centre for Financial Analysis and Policy, Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; email: jg548@cam.ac.uk",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900405186

Futuribles occupies a special place in the world of so-called generalist magazines, both by its longevity and its continuity of editorship. It is also distinguished by its resolutely forward-looking orientation and the desire to deliver the kind of information and thinking to its readers that are indispensable for understanding the contemporary world and for acting, as a consequence, with maximum lucidity. The aim, to quote the argument of Hugues de Jouvenel, is ultimately to empower ourselves to be architects of a chosen future, not victims of one that we simply undergo. But always looking forward doesn't prevent us, from time to time, from taking a glance in the rear-view mirror and, on the occasion of this 400th issue, attempting a brief retrospective assessment. And so Hugues de Jouvenel, the founder and editor of futuribles, has scanned these 40 years of Futuribles and identified some of the major topics covered in our pages on which we can claim to have been farsighted and even pioneering. These include foresight methods and ethics, development indicators and models, the resources and limits of our ecosystem, and social change. He also points up certain editorial weaknesses, particularly in the field of science and technology, and a number of blind spots with regard to geopolitics. After 40 years of observing and reflecting on the world and how it may develop, readers will, we hope, have acquired the conviction that the future remains, in many ways, open; and that, provided one has the right information and knows how to distinguish the essential from the merely incidental-which is one of futuribles's prime objectives-it remains possible to build that future or to modify its course.",,,,,,,"La fée croissance (2000) Futuribles, (252), pp. 3-4. , avril; Godet, M., Nouvelle croissance ou vieilles lunes ?

However, due to uncertainty about the progress of necessary infrastructure investments, public acceptance and cost developments of renewable energies, the achievement of political plans is uncertain. Implementation risks of renewable energy targets are challenging for investment planning, because different shares of RES-E fundamentally change the optimal mix of dispatchable power plants. Specifically, uncertain future RES-E deployment paths induce uncertainty about the level and the steepness of the residual load duration curve and the hourly residual load structure. In this paper, we show how uncertain future RES-E penetration levels impact the electricity system and try to quantify effects for the Central European power market. We use a multi-stage stochastic investment and dispatch model to analyze effects on investment choices, electricity generation and system costs. Our main findings include that uncertainty about the achievement of RES-E targets significantly affects optimal investment and dispatch decisions. In particular, plants with a medium capital/operating cost ratio have a higher value under uncertainty. We find that this technology choice is mainly driven by the uncertainty about the level rather than about the structure of the residual load. Furthermore, given larger investments in plants with medium capital/operating cost ratio under uncertainty, optimal investments in storage units are lower than under perfect foresight. In the case of the Central European power market, costs induced by the implementation risk of renewable energies are rather small compared to total system costs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Multi-stage stochastic programming; Power plant optimization; Renewable energy","Commerce; Costs; Economics; Electric generators; Lead acid batteries; Optimization; Power plants; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Electricity generation; Infrastructure investment; Multi-stage stochastic programming; Plant optimization; Power plant investment; Renewable energies; Renewable energy deployments; Renewable energy source; Investments",,,,,"Birge, J.R., Louveaux, F., Glynn, P., Robinson, S., (1997) Introduction to Stochastic Programming, , Springer, Berlin; (2011) Erneuerbare Energien in Zahlen-Internet-Update Ausgewählter Daten, , BMU.

The major findings of the study are: 1) the major strength of the Finnish bio-coal sector is its secured biomass supply, higher environmental credentials, and supportive policies. The clear implication here is that the entrance requirement for the bio-coal business is relatively low, ""early birds"" with foresight will win out; 2) the current weakness of Finnish bio-coal development is undeniable. As an entirely new business, bio-coal does not have a clear development model, which can be attributed to the little market information available, non-viable economic structure, and distribution channels which are not yet available. We would like to advise Finnish companies to work out the cost structure, profit feasibility of the bio-coal business and construct a practicable and sustainable biomass supply system; 3) the opportunities of the Finnish bio-coal sector come along with the national sustainability development policies and construction of a bio-economy. We would suggest that they focus on decentralised local economic sales, biomass supply and energy end use; 4) the crucial threat to the bio-coal sector industry comes from competition with fossil coal and other wood-based biofuels. Improving its competitiveness requires cooperation and integration along the whole supply chain. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bio-coal; Bio-economy; Biomass; Co-firing; Finland; Sustainable energy","Biomass; Coal; Commerce; Competition; Economics; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Bio-coal; Bio-economy; Co-firing; Finland; Sustainable energy; Coal industry; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass power; biotechnology; economic structure; energy market; profitability; sustainability; Finland; Aves",,,,,"Gold, S., Bioenergy supply chain and stakeholders (2011) Mitig Adapt Strat Global Change, 16 (4), pp. 439-462; Mikkilä, M., Heinimö, J., Panapanaan, V., Linnanen, L., Faaij, A., Evaluation of sustainability schemes for international bioenergy flows (2009) Int J Energy Sector, 3 (4), pp. 359-382; (2010) Motiva Bioenergy in Finland, , http://www.motiva.fi/files/3475/Bioenergy_in_Finland.pdf, Available from: [C 10 N 2012]; Hakkila, P., Factors driving the development of forest energy in Finland (2006) Biomass energy, 30 (4), pp. 281-288; Ericsson, K., Huttunen, S., Nilsson, L.J., Svenningsson, P., Bioenergy policy and market development in Finland and Sweden (2004) Energy Policy, 32 (15), pp. 1707-1721; Heinimö, J., Methodological aspects on international biofuels trade: international streams and trade of solid and liquid biofuels in Finland (2008) Biomass Bioenergy, 32 (8), pp. 702-716; Heinimö, J., Alakangas, E., (2009) Market of biomass fuels in Finland, , IEA Bioenergy task 40 and EUBIONET III - country report of Finland; Alakangas, E., Paju, P., (2002) Wood pellets in Finland-technology, economy and markets, , OPET report 5, VTT Energy, Jyväskylä; (2009) Pellet market country report Finland.

Given the role of the brain's default mode network (DMN) in self-reflection and future thought, this study investigates whether DMN is altered in adolescents with CD and SUD, relative to controls. Methods: Twenty adolescent males with CD and SUD and 20 male controls of similar ages underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they completed a risk-taking decision task. We used independent component analysis as a data-driven approach to identify the DMN spatial component in individual subjects. DMN activity was then compared between groups. Results: Compared to controls, patients showed reduced activity in superior, medial and middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area (BA) 10), retrosplenial cortex (BA 30) and lingual gyrus (BA 18), and bilateral middle temporal gryus (BA 21/22) - DMN regions thought to support self-referential evaluation, memory, foresight, and perspective taking. Furthermore, this pattern of reduced activity in patients remained robust after adjusting for the effects of depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Conversely, when not adjusting for effects of depression and ADHD, patients demonstrated greater DMN activity than controls solely in the cuneus (BA 19). Conclusions: Collectively, these results suggest that comorbid CD and SUD in adolescents is characterized by atypical activity in brain regions thought to play an important role in introspective processing. These functional imbalances in brain networks may provide further insight into the neural underpinnings of conduct and substance use disorders. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Conduct disorder; Default mode network; Functional MRI; Independent component analysis; Substance use disorder","adolescent; adult; article; attention deficit disorder; brain cortex; clinical article; conduct disorder; controlled study; cuneus; decision making; default mode network; depression; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; independent component analysis; lingual gyrus; male; memory; middle frontal gyrus; middle temporal gryus; priority journal; retrosplenial cortex; substance abuse; superior frontal gyrus; task performance; Conduct disorder; Default mode network; Functional MRI; Independent component analysis; Substance use disorder; Adolescent; Brain; Conduct Disorder; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Psychomotor Performance; Substance-Related Disorders",,,,,"Achenbach, T.M., (1991) Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 and 1991 Profile, , University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT; Achenbach, T.M., (1991) Manual for the Youth Self-Report and 1991 Profile, , University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT; Allen, E.A., Erhardt, E.B., Damaraju, E., Gruner, W., Segall, J.M., Silva, R.F., Havlicek, M., Calhoun, V.D., A baseline for the multivariate comparison of resting-state networks (2011) Front.

The relationship between South Africa and China has been developing since diplomatic ties were established on 1 January 1998. Since then, South Africa-Chinas bilateral relations have undergone rapid and all-facet development. There were frequent high level and other kinds of mutual exchanges between the two countries. The bilateral relations within the space of fifteen years have evolved from a Partnership to a Strategic Partnership, and then to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Furthermore, in the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which was set out in the Beijing Declaration signed in 2010, the two countries expressed the desire to further strengthen and deepen cooperation in both bilateral and regional affairs by establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership based on equality, mutual benefit and common development. The agreements range from political dialogue, trade, investment, mineral exploration, manufacturing, and agriculture to joint efforts in the global arena, such as in the United Nations, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), and Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). In recognition of the aforementioned bilateral achievements, on 19 September 2013, an Ambassadorial forum was co-hosted by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), The Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China in the Republic of South Africa, and the Africa Institute of South Africa Human Science Research Council (AISA–HSRC). The objective of the Ambassadorial Forum was to provide an opportunity for refl ections on the past and outlook on the future diplomatic relations between South Africa and China. This book presents the offi cial keynote addresses which provide strategic thinking and foresight into the bilateral relations between the two countries. The main substance of the book is a collection of the Ambassadorial Forum papers that were submitted. The papers evaluate economic and political progress from a national interest perspective. Progress is measured against variables such as trade growth, people-to-people development, partnerships, and the implementation of state agreements, all against the background of the theory of national interest. © Africa Institute of South Africa 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Africa Institute of South Africa",,,,,,9780798304740; 9780798304733,,,"English","Perspectives on South Africa-China Relations at 15 Years",Book,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952308335

Consciousness is also seen as interwoven in socio-cultural contexts. We will discuss facets of this continuum and relate them to ontogenetic and phylogenetic states of individuals. This will be done by pointing out parallels between the development of memory systems and the development of the self in human beings, and by showing that most animal species lack insight and foresight and the capacity to travel back and forth in time; and that as a consequence of these incapacities animals stand on a lower level of consciousness. Furthermore, it will be shown that in human beings the development of language and theory of mind functions contributes to the establishment of a conscious mind. The social and cultural context has to be added as mechanisms that contribute and manifest the ability to consciously reflect on the environment. Both an insufficient ontogenetic development and disturbed brain functions in later life may be lead to disturbances of consciousness. This will be discussed with respect to a number of neurological and psychiatric disease conditions. On the neurological site, damage to specific core regions in the brain, but also of more widespread networks (""default mode networks"") may impair consciousness significantly. On the psychiatric level, there are so to say standard illnesses such as schizophrenia which cloud conscious reflection. Of higher interest are, however, more rare disease conditions as dissociative (psychogenic) amnesias which frequently lead to identity disturbances or a complete loss of identity and therefore to a change in consciousness which is radically different from that which occurs as a consequence of drug or alcohol abuse, or after degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. States and mechanisms of consciousness consequently will be discussed within this spectrum of pathological conditions and processes with the aim to provide an integrated framework of attributes necessary for autonoetic - self-reflected - consciousness. 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Phenylephrine and ephedrine affect frontal lobe oxygenation (ScO2) differently when assessed by spatially resolved near infrared spectroscopy. We evaluated the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on extra- vs intra-cerebral blood flow and on ScO 2. Methods. In 10 healthy males (age 20-54 yr), phenylephrine or ephedrine was infused for an ~20 mm Hg increase in mean arterial pressure. Cerebral oxygenation (SavO2) was calculated from the arterial and jugular bulb oxygen saturations. Blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICAf) and blood flow in the external carotid artery (ECAf) were assessed by duplex ultrasonography. Invos-5100c (SinvosO2) and Foresight (SforeO2) determined ScO 2 while forehead skin oxygenation (SskinO2) was assessed. Results. Phenylephrine reduced SforeO2 by 6.9% (95% confidence interval: 4.8-9.0%; P&lt;0.0001), SinvosO2 by 10.5 (8.2-12.9%; P&lt;0.0001), and ECAf (6-28%; P=0.0001), but increased ICAf (5-21%; P=0.003) albeit with no consequence for SskinO 2 or SavO2. In contrast, SforeO 2 was maintained with administration of ephedrine while S invosO2 and SavO2 decreased [by 3.1 (0.7-4.5%; P=0.017) and 2.1 (0.5-3.3%; P=0.012)] as arterial carbon dioxide pressure decreased (P=0.003). ICAf was stable and ECAf increased by 11 (4-18%; P=0.005) with administration of ephedrine while SskinO2 did not change. Conclusions. The effect of phenylephrine on ScO 2 is governed bya decrease in external carotid blood flow since it increases cerebral blood flow as determined by flow in the internal carotid artery. In contrast, ScO2 is largely maintained with administration of ephedrine because blood flow to extracerebral tissue increases. © The Author [2014].","Cerebral blood flow; Cerebral oxygenation; Ephedrine; Phenylephrine; Skin blood flow","ephedrine; phenylephrine; adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; ephedrine; oxygen; adult; arterial carbon dioxide tension; article; blood carbon dioxide tension; brain blood flow; carotid artery flow; Doppler echography; external carotid artery; forehead; forehead skin oxygenation; frontal lobe; frontal lobe oxygenation; human; human experiment; hyperventilation; internal carotid artery; male; mean arterial pressure; near infrared spectroscopy; noradrenalin blood level; normal human; oxygen saturation; priority journal; skin; tissue oxygenation; drug effects; external carotid artery; frontal lobe; metabolism; middle aged; near infrared spectroscopy; procedures; reference value; vascularization; young adult; Adrenergic Agents; Adult; Carotid Artery, External; Ephedrine; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oxygen; Reference Values; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Young Adult",,"ephedrine, 299-42-3, 50-98-6; phenylephrine, 532-38-7, 59-42-7, 61-76-7; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Adrenergic Agents; Ephedrine; Oxygen",,,"Vatner, S.F., Braunwald, E., Cardiovascular control mechanisms in the conscious state (1975) N Engl J Med, 293, pp. 970-976; Lassen, N.A., Cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption in man (1959) Physiol Rev, 39, pp. 183-238; Joshi, B., Ono, M., Brown, C., Predicting the limits of cerebral autoregulation during cardiopulmonary bypass (2012) Anesth Analg, 114, pp. 503-510; Bundgaard-Nielsen, M., Ruhnau, B., Secher, N.H., Kehlet, H., Flow-related techniques for preoperative goal-directed fluid optimization (2007) Br J Anaesth, 98, pp. 38-44; Goldman, S., Sutter, F., Ferdinand, F., Trace, C., Optimizing intraoperative cerebral oxygen delivery using noninvasive cerebral oximetry decreases the incidence of stroke for cardiac surgical patients (2004) Heart Surg Forum, 7, pp. E376-E381; Murkin, J.M., Adams, S.J., Novick, R.J., Monitoring brain oxygen saturation during coronary bypass surgery: A randomized, prospective study (2007) Anesth Analg, 104, pp. 51-58; Casati, A., Fanelli, G., Pietropaoli, P., Continuous monitoring of cerebraloxygensaturation in elderlypatients undergoingmajorabdominal surgery minimizes brain exposure to potential hypoxia (2005) Anesth Analg, 101, pp. 740-747; Heringlake, M., Garbers, C., Kabler, J.H., Preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation and clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery (2011) Anesthesiology, 114, pp. 58-69; Rasmussen, P., Dawson, E.A., Nybo, L., Van Lieshout, J.J., Secher, N.H., Gjedde, A., Capillary-oxygenation-level-dependent near-infrared spectrometry in frontal lobe of humans (2007) J Cereb Blood Flow Metab, 27, pp. 1082-1093; Suzuki, S., Takasaki, S., Ozaki, T., Kobayashi, Y., A tissue oxygenation monitor using NIR spatially resolved spectroscopy (1999) Proc SPIE, 3597, pp. 582-592; Brassard, P., Seifert, T., Secher, N.H., Is cerebral oxygenation negatively affected by infusion of norepinephrine in healthy subjects?

This contribution aims at analyzing the ethical aspects of the Diatriba. The preface already contains elements that constitute the ethical manifesto of Ramazzini. He shows compassion ("" we must admit that the workers in certain arts and crafts sometimes derive from them grave injuries""), expresses gratitude (""we owe this to the wretched condition of the workers from whose manual toil. so many benefits accrue""), demonstrates a sense of justice ("" .in our own time also laws have been passed in well-ordered cities to secure good conditions for the workers; so it is only right that the art of medicine should contribute its portion for the benefit and relief of those for whom the law has shown such foresight"") and demonstrates his willingness to be helpful to workers ("". I have tried to unearth in the shops of craftsmen. To suggest medical precautions for the prevention and treatment of such diseases as usually affect the workers""). The ethical contribution of Ramazzini, however, goes far beyond these noble and heartfelt words, demonstrating his intellectual and moral depth. In fact, alongside comments and suggestions, quotations and proposals, information and warnings, the Magister offers a framework for his beliefs on the attitude that the physician should adopt. Prudence and moderation inspire his recommendations when he speaks directly and indirectly to workers; irony and sarcasm pervade his thoughts when he talks to his colleagues, fairness and integrity inspire his remarks to authorities. Although current practice is based on ethical rules dating back to more recent times, the ethical vision of the Magister, that is admirable for its honesty, originality and depth, is in some respects still relevant today.","B.

The second is to present material that provides grounds for developing effective responses. Design/methodology/approach-The issue draws on evidence from previous research, economic modelling and a range of other sources to investigate the hypothesis that humanity is heading towards an “overshoot and collapse” future. It further suggests that a useful way of responding is to explore the possibility that the prospect of collapse can be moderated or avoided through a process of “conscious descent.” Findings-The main findings are that a very wide spectrum of policies, actions, strategies and options is available that can and should be used to help us avoid the most disastrous manifestations of “overshoot and collapse.” Yet there are also many barriers and impediments that continue to inhibit effective responses. This means that the process of coming to grips with the “civilisational challenge” will take longer and become increasingly costly. Denialism and short term thinking remain embedded in dominant institutions and mainstream practice. Currently, vastly more is miss-spent on various perverse incentives (e.g. advertising, the funding of denial, fossil fuel subsidies) than on securing the future of civilisation. This can be seen as a consequence of outdated values and inadequate worldviews. Research limitations/implications-The contributions here represent a sample from within a rapidly expanding field of enquiry and action. They should therefore be seen as indicating the need for further high quality investigation, work and action. The main implication is that this process needs to be taken seriously, properly resourced and eventually transformed into a mainstream social project. Originality/value-The papers are contributions to an in-depth understanding of a complex and evolving situation. Their value lies in the fact that greater understanding and a commitment to early action are among the most productive investments available to societies vulnerable to the systemic threats outlined here. As such, the special issue evokes a fundamental tenet of foresight work in general. Or to put this in the words of Bertrand de Jouvenel, “the proof of improvidence lies in falling under the empire of necessity.” © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Civilisational challenge; Conscious descent; Denialism; Limits to growth; Overshoot and collapse; Social project",,,,,,"Bardi, U., (2013) The Limits to Growth Revisited, , Hall, C.A.S.

The author determines the relation of the concepts of «restriction of human rights and fundamental freedoms» and «interference with the rights», names the reasons for which the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation named these legal categories as similar in 2013. The author states the urgency of determining the terms of legitimate restrictions of human rights and assigning them to a particular criteria, their relationship and some problems of its interpretation in criminal matters. In addition, the author focuses on legal positions of the European Court of Human Rights, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, the Plenum of Supreme Court of the Russian Federation in 2013, which reflect the degree of importance (role) of each of them in achieving the interim (tactical) and final (global) objectives, the rules to overcome the competition between the indicators, which is important to keep in mind regarding the criminal sphere, modern vision of the place of international norms and agreements in the Russian legal system.The legality criteria and its indicators related to the form of the law (availability, certainty, stability and predictability), are characterized by taking into account changes of the Russian Constitution, the law on international treaties, international treaties signed by Russia, the legal position of the Constitutional Court, the place of international law and treaties in the Russian legal system, supremacy of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the purpose of our study. It is concluded that the availability, certainty, clarity, specificity, stability of the law serve as a means of achieving an interim goal - the possibility of foresight, predicting the effects of human rights restrictions and changing the legal status. But this is a tactical (interim) goal, not the ultimate (global) goal, because all the formal terms(conditions) of lawful rights restrictions (interferences) can be met, but if the law is not justified and the restriction is disproportionate to the legitimate aims, then it is not necessary in a democratic society, which is possible only if the content (material) conditions (terms) of the legality of interference with the rights are satisfied. © 2014 Criminology Journal of Baikal National University of Economics and Law.

Then it 3D model is gained after triangularization process and surface fitting. This model is compared with a CAD model which is an element design representation. In order to provide such comparison, the proper implementation of the MLDMCS (Material Loss Detection Method for Cylindrical Shape parts) in to the software is needed. The software is prepared in Visual Studio environment (.NET) with C# programing language (the algorithm code and the interface), SQL server (database) and Siemens NX software (PARASOLID internal libraries). MLDMCS is implemented as the one of the author Computer Aided Overhaul software modules (CAO). The implementation is a complex task, according to: interface preparation, data collecting, data presentation an input data form, proper set of input data configuration, preparation of 3D graphics processing an analysis algorithms, preparation of output data form and interpretation. The result of software algorithm should be an easy to interpret set of data with a possibility of automatic rapport generation. Furthermore the data should be collected in a data base for future analysis of element worn and damage repeatable progression. Data collected each time from during it technical state examination of element gives also an answer to future proceeding according critical quantity of refurbishing processes in recirculation of technical mean. Additionally collected data gives suggestion of it repeatability in worn or damage after various technologies of refurbishing. Future systems probably will contain such solution and MLDMCS will be one of a typical method used in industry oriented to overhaul of machines parts. Previously presented article, shows only pure method with it foundations. Nowadays solutions are mainly based on a metrology, also supported with CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machines) and offline measuring paths generating systems. The accuracy of proposed solution (3D scanning and transformation of point clouds to solid model) is less accurate than typical measuring methods; however foresights of application are promising.

In envisioning the world at 2050, we envisaged future growth in four possible directions: growth without limits, growth within limits, stagnation, and New Welfare. The scenario considered as preferable reflects a transition toward a New Welfare, characterized by a high level of cooperation, heightened concern for the environment and for social welfare, and an increased share of immaterial consumption. This scenario is based on the recognition that the development of new technologies - although relevant - turns out to be insufficient to resolve the issue of resource scarcity alone. Important behavioral changes are also needed. In the New Welfare scenario, GDP as a measure of growth becomes obsolete and needs to be replaced with ways of measuring progress that are more reflective of natural, human, and social capital. The New Welfare scenario also charts a pathway toward a low-carbon future, with an overall reduction in energy consumption, density, and intensity, and a greatly reduced reliance on fossil fuels. A new, smart electric grid facilitates active demand management and decentralized production of power. Natural gas or even small nuclear plants tackle problems associated with the intermittency of renewable energy sources. Among other likely shifts under this scenario is a re-conceptualization of production, from short-lived to longer-lasting goods and from private to open source knowledge products and services; growth in recycling and zero-waste processes; and a shift from profit-driven business to entrepreneurship that seeks to satisfy social needs and build local capital. The world undergoes a transition from unequal growth to prosperity in a multi-polar, globally interdependent world. New global democracy networks and institutions are created, and constitutions extend beyond the protection of human rights to the recognition of ""nature rights."" Citizens' income is tied to the social welfare-oriented duties and participatory governance. This scenario further leaves room to new forms of self-regulation of common resources. Actions necessary for the shift to the New Welfare paradigm include the adoption of new metrics for measuring progress, measures to increase public acceptance of technological and societal change, the creation of new global and local institutions devoted to sustainable management of shared environmental resources, sustainable production and consumption patterns, and a low-carbon energy and transport systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Foresight methods; Global and local democracy; Lifestyle change; Paradigm shifts; Scenario building; Steady state economy; Wellbeing and sustainability metrics","consumption behavior; democracy; economic development; fossil fuel; future prospect; Gross Domestic Product; human capital; lifestyle; natural capital; quality of life; resource scarcity; social capital; sustainability; technological development; transportation system",,,,,,"Sessa, C.; Institute of Studies for the Integration of Systems, Rome, Italy; email: mc7920@mclink.it",,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,00163287,,,,"English","Futures",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899927318

A recent American Orthopedic Association symposium sought to address three major aspects of hiring that affect orthopaedic leaders: (1) when to hire - the chairperson's role; (2) generational issues that affect hiring; and (3) the development of an initial compensation package. How does the chairperson recruit new physicians? Hiring a new partner into the academic setting requires a good deal of foresight. There must be an established game plan. Advertising and interviews need to be orchestrated. Chairpersons can find information about candidates from many unique sources. Fit within the department and community is important and must be cultivated. Spouses and families need special attention. Research candidates have individual needs. Perhaps the most important aspect of recruitment is the development of a realistic business plan. This paper provides an overview of factors to consider in managing a new hire. Generational issues are intriguing. Should they affect our hiring practices? It seems clear to established physicians that the new generation of graduates is different from their predecessors. Is this really true? Most everyone is familiar with the terms ""Silent Generation,"" ""Baby Boomers,"" ""Generation X,"" and ""Generation Y."" Is there anything to be gained by categorizing an applicant? Is it important to hire a replica of one's self? This paper provides a thoughtful overview of generational issues as they apply to hiring new partners. Most department chairpersons are not trained as negotiators. Some preparation and experience are helpful in guiding the process of making an initial offer to a candidate. It is not all about pay. The package includes the guarantee period, expectations for the new hire, mentorship, and resources. How much should new orthopaedic academic hires be paid? Recent benchmark data from the Academic Orthopaedic Consortium suggest a mean income of $282,667 for physicians who have just finished a fellowship. New hires are concerned about call frequency and available time free from work. How much work should be expected from an academic surgeon? Recent survey data from the American Orthopaedic Consortium suggest a mean of 9200 relative value units per year. This article offers some guidelines for the chairperson who needs to formulate an initial offer for a new hire. There is a lot involved in hiring a new partner, as times are changing. This paper offers considerable food for thought about hiring.

When he met Leonard Wood in 1897, he recognized a kindred spirit. Moreover, the two men shared a zeal for making the United States an imperial power that would challenge Great Britain as world leader. For the remainder of their lives, their careers would intertwine in ways that shaped the American nation. When the Spanish American War came, both men seized the opportunity to promote the goals of American empire. Roosevelt resigned as assistant secretary of the navy in William McKinley’s administration to serve as a lieutenant colonel of the Rough Riders, a newly organized volunteer cavalry. Wood, then a captain in the medical corps and physician to McKinley, was promoted to colonel and given charge of the unit. Roosevelt later took over command of the Rough Riders. In the Battle of San Juan Hill, he led it in a charge up Kettle Hill that would end in victory for the American troops and make their daring commander a household name, a war hero, and, eventually, president of the United States. At the Treaty of Paris in 1898, Spain ceded Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. The next year, Wood became military governor of Cuba. He remained in the post until 1902. By that time Roosevelt was president. One of the major accomplishments of his administration was reorganization of the War Department, which the war with Spain had proved disastrously outdated. In 1909, when William Howard Taft needed a strong army chief of staff to enforce the new rules, he appointed Leonard Wood. Both Wood and Roosevelt were strong proponents of preparedness, and when war broke out in Europe in August 1914, Wood, retired as chief of staff and backed by Roosevelt, established the “Plattsburg camps,” a system of basic training camps. When America entered the Great War, the two men’s foresight was justified, but their earlier push for mobilization had angered Woodrow Wilson, and both were denied the command positions they sought in Europe. Roosevelt died in 1919 while preparing for another presidential campaign. Wood made a run in his place but was never taken seriously as a candidate. He retired from the army and spent the last seven years of his life as civilian governor of the Philippines. It was a quiet end for two men who had been giants of their time. While their modernization of the army is widely admired, they were not without their critics. Roosevelt and Wood saw themselves as bold leaders but were regarded by some as ruthless strivers. And while their shared ambitions for the United States were tempered by a strong sense of duty, they could, in their certainty and determination, trample those who stood in their path. Teddy Roosevelt and Leonard Wood: Partners in Command is a revealing and long overdue look at the dynamic partnership of this fascinating pair and will be welcomed by scholars and military history enthusiasts alike. © 2014 by University of Missouri Press.

The entry into force of the Act of July5th 2011 finally allowed France to comply with the European recommendations and showed that, following this, the Constitutional Council would provide encouragement to legislative reform through the procedure known as the ""Question Prioritaire de Constitutionnalité"" (an application for a preliminary ruling on whether a legislative provision is constitutional). The search for balance and the emergency context within which this reform has been developed both show its fragility, which explains why a partial reform was adopted in September 2013 in order to introduce legislative corrections. One of the main provisions of the Act of July5th 2011 is the encroachment of the judiciary on daily psychiatric practice, since provision is made for the systematic control of all hospitalizations without consent lasting more than 15 days by the ""judge ruling on civil detention cases"" (""juge des libertés et de la détention""). This judicial review imposes greater rigour on the issue of medical certificates, since the prospect of legal inspection must now be taken into account. This underlines the importance of training in forensic psychiatry for psychiatric residents and practitioners. More generally mental health professionals should in the future be more involved in the drafting of the law. Current legal developments reflect the divided expectations of society and make the issue of the psychiatrist's responsibility more prevalent. The backdrop to this is a society in which the precautionary principle has gradually become a legal principle in its own right, in an overall context determined by the debate between those defending individual freedoms and those who subordinate these to safety. At the same time, we are witnessing a paradigm shift of law and the transition from the post-war welfare state model to a neoliberal approach. This is based on the principle that responsibility should be vested in the individual and that s/he is presumed to be rational. The outcome is a governmentalist attitude, based on the need to leave nothing to chance and entailing an extensive concept of the precautionary principle - in other words, giving priority to the principle of foresight, in order to ensure optimisation of the ability to pre-empt « the worst». This concept has obviously implications in terms of individual responsibility, since responsibility for an act lies with those who should have foreseen it. In the field of medical practice, this responsibility can be questioned through the items noted in the medical file (history, diagnosis, consistency between medical and nursing records). It can also be questioned in relation to the means available to protect the patient (from himself), family members or any third party. This responsibility can also be related to prescriptions for medication, which can sometimes be interpreted as reflecting underestimation of the risk. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Act of July 5th 2011; Libertarian current; Precautionary principle; Psychiatrist's responsibility; Secure current","Article; detention; forensic psychiatry; France; hospitalization; human; informed consent; medical ethics; medical practice; medicolegal aspect; mental health care; mental health care personnel; prescription; resident",,,,,"Allilaire, J.F., Cléry-Melin, P., Guedj, M.J., Leguay, D., Senon, J.L., Violence et psychiatrie.

But times have changed. 'ibday there is a significant body of planning literature addressing post-disaster recov- ci', So man I ii s progi ms and conditions ha e clnnged however, that there is still considerable need among plan- neTs for this new report. In flict, APA undertook an cx- tensive needs assessment for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to demonstrate the value of this undertaking One thing learned in the interim is that cornniunities ne subject to majoi calastiophic ci cnts that arc quite literally, game changers that alter the under standing both of the extent of the vulnerahilities of communities and the magnitude of the events that are possible. Events such as Hurricane Katrina and the Tohoku earthquake in Japan have demonstrated that the best plans may not fully the magnitude of what is possible. Equally impor- federal disaster officials and local planners have had to grapple with the implications of mitigating flood hazards in densely developed waterfront neighborhoods. Ihere is also growing appreciation of the value of green infrastructure in helping to mitigate coast ii hiiaids an appriciation that is being reflected in changes in federal policy priorities. While preparing this report. the Al'A team had the oppoitunits to learn from ditect irnoh crncnt in the reoet from Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey, where presented a series of training workshops on recovery p1 inning in pi il 201 l1ii ii is lust Smill pii t of thoicrill let U of dini t bt tedet il St ik and local planners in the region, but it helped the project team gain perspective on the event and what followed, One factor that became clear in the report of the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding 'task Force headed by Shaun Donovan, then secretary of Housing Urban Development, was that there was a much greater emphasis on concepts of resilience than in any previous diIster [H iteniphisis includid explicit ricogriltion c,f the Ion tel Iii impacts of climate ch Enge Considci ibh gie itel emphasis was also placed on the development of green in- frastructure as part of an overall resilience strategy than had been the case before Sandy. At the same time, Sandy exposed operitional challenges for tht federal gui crnmcnt mc pli itly for the new Nalional Disaster Recovery Framework. 'Ihese new lessons do not obliterate ongoing challenges that predated Sandy. Ihese include: the need te, accept the inherent complexity of post-disaster rsco\ in nd the need for communities to take local ownership of their situation and gain a full understanding of the relationships among federal, state, and local entities. Still, amid all the frustrations-and sorrows of post-disasenvision ter recovery, there are opportunities. The most resilient corntarn, munitieS are those with the civic mindset to seize on those opportunities to create new visions for the future. What is resilience? According to the National Academy of Sciences, resilience is the cibjljtt' to fCJUft nid plan for, ,il'o 1' n coir 1 ft o,n and mat Luc sf it/li thfapf lv ath ; events. Part of the purpose of this report is to make clear that one effective Way Ifl which communities can advance public health satet', and welt lie is to Ihink and p1 in in id\ nice tor their foreseeable recovery needs following a disaster, in adAPA dition to taking appropriate steps to mitigate hazards before a dis istci Opportunities to idi ince communit', leslllcrcc may ansi dtu Ing long term reco ci', Ii om disistir that in I', not arise at any other time. Being prepared to optimize those opportumtie.s is one purpose ofa resilient community. It is important to embed the concept of resilience within the wider framework of sustainahiliiy. It is equally imporand tarn that susrainahility incorporate the concept of resilience. Resilience allows a community Lu respond to and recover effecti',e[ ti om specihc ci cnts sustitnabilit', is 'i ti line of I eterence th it ilnis to presci ii for future genel itluns the i e sources and opportunities that exist for current generations. ANTICIPATING DISRUPTION Planning is by its very nature an optimistic enterprise, but life can be messy Setbacks of all sorts happen to individu- als, their neighborhoods, whole communities, and even na- tions. in this context a communit's willingness to examine its hazards and to anticipate and plan tbr potentia] disasters important. Unless communities incorpolate an awal'eness of their hazards into their lOng-term planning, they may not confront the fact that land-use choices greatly ifhc t thc outc omc vs Ith thur rc suiting loss. s of liv s mci ptopcr t P1 innIng for seth Kkc is an essential ingiedient ot iesilience W h it distinguishes divmstei ti cm most other set backs in a community is the speed of their occurrence and the ccimpressed time frame in which recovery must occur. Thus, the important focus is on the problem of anticipating disruption by disasters and planning to minimize their det- impacts. State Roles in Recovery Planning States control the statutory framework for local planning and roning iuthoi ilics Ihis Ii vs soimic bc ii ing on thc st itc rok iii influencing local planning for post-disaster recovery, but so do emergency management policies. ihe most common feature of states is that their planning institutions are not set in a fashion that is parallel to those in cities, counties, and regions. Often there is no state planning office or function, al- though states perform numerous other functions that have a direct bearing on planning, and particularly on hazard iden Lilication and post-disaster recovery. States also act as agents of numerous federal progrm11i otten icting vs ith authot its delegated to them from tedei ii agencies Resilient Management The most essential element of resilient management may be a purely human one: the courage to make toLigh decisions. Without that, all else may fail, But it is also important to perceive the city as a system of systems, within which resilience can be embodied at a number of ]c'vels. Resilient systems base identifiable characteristics that include diversity, redun dancv, decentralization, transparency, collaboration, grace in failure, flexibility, and foresight, Risk management, closely related to resilient manage- ment, can he achieved through cost-heneht analysis. The Governmental Finance Officers Association has established a framework for such analysis to help ensure that cominu- ni[ies have the resources to overcome foreseeable setbacks. Risk management also occurs through mitigation, which in pai t is mattel ot propei I) investing i esoutces to achieve risk reduction, for instaice, by removing homes from the flood- plain and thus reducing the amount of vulnerable property iii need ci pmtection. The challenge with hazard mitigation as a risk reduction tool lies in incorporating it into the rest of the planning process rather than isolating it. It is equally im becomes portant for a community to understand how to incorporate mitigation into the recovery planning process. it is important to build resilience capacity in communi tit s 'Ihis ip ic its is most likely to In inifc St itselt in gi ate! tlei.ibilit md abilit to adapt The Planner's Role In some states, the planner's role is made clear through state requirements to include some type ofhazards-related element in the local comprehensive plan. California provides one ex rimental ample, wheiestate law mandate.s the inclusion of a 'safety' element, which has evolved to cover numerous hazards, such as floods and earthquakes. California is one of at least ten states with mandates or prescriptions for such elements. Lv cn vs ithout such pitscriptive I equn ements plmnners have skill sets that are vital in designing processes for public participation in hazards planning, including plans for post- disaster recovery They are or can become familiar with spe up cilic kinds of scenario planning and visualization software that can help make public participation more meaningful. The ai'rayof these tools is almost certain to grow in the future.
