Indian Transport sector is also severely affected by chronic corruption, inefficiency and overcrowded due to the poor planning. In this paper, we discuss about the definition and basic difference between e-government and e-Governance. Secondly, discuss current status of e-Governance in public transportation followed, the study about foresight and its functionality. On the basis of analysis performed on commuters and officials, the foresight is used as a tool to determine the appropriate strategies for the development of ICT enabled services for effective and efficient development of an e-Governance model for the public transportation. Therefore the implementation of e-Governance by using analysis and foresight as a tool can be able to improve the services in the public transportation sector. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","analytical; e-Governance; e-Government; foresight; ICT; Public Transportation; Strategic model; strategy","analytical; E-governance; e-Government; foresight; ICT; Public transportation; Strategic models; strategy; Artificial intelligence; Developing countries; Government data processing; Information technology",,,,,"(2001) LAC PREM - Issues Note: E-Government and the World Bank, , World Bank, November 5; http://www.egovindia.org/egovernancepaper.doc, SpeG A society for promotion of e-Governance; Mohanty, P.K., Using E-Tools for Good Governance & Administrative Reforms, , http://www.cgg.gov.in/workingpapers/eGovPaperARC.pdf; India Transpor Sector - Roads, , http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/ EXTSARREGTOPTRANSPORT/0,contentMDK:20703625~menuPK:868822~pagePK:34004173~piPK: 34003707~theSitePK:579598,00.html; Martin, B.R., Foresight in Science and Technology (1995) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 7 (2), pp. 139-168; Voros, J., A generic foresight process framework (2003) Foresight, 5 (3), pp. 10-21; Bharti, A.K., Dwivedi, S.K., Proceedings of ICSCA-2011 (2011) IPCSIT, 9, pp. 7-12. , ISSN 2010-460X; Shahkooh, K.A., Abdollahi, A., Fasanghari, M., Azadnia, M., Foresight based Framework for E-government Strategic Planning (2009) Journal of Software, 4 (6), pp. 544-549; Dwivedi, S.K., Bharti, A.K., e-Governance in India - Problems and Acceptability (2010) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information and Technology (JATIT), 17 (1), pp. 37-43. , ISSN 1992-8645","Bharti, A.K.; Department of Computer Science, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, India",,"Assoc.

The theory connects the area of accounting regulations and the place where the result of their application is put into use, namely the capital market. Quantifying this connection is done indirectly, by using two direct connections. First we quantify the similitude degree of the considered accounting regulations based on a detailed content analysis. Secondly we quantify to what extent the foresights of the considered accounting regulations are actually used in practice by companies being listed on the capital market. Once determined the two correlations we derive the link between a certain capital market and a set of accounting regulations that is different from the one officially being applied by companies listed in the considered market. The proposed theory is tested by considering accounting regulations issued by the IASB and the FASB and companies being listed on the LSE and the NYSE, focusing on financial assets' measurement. We conclude by validating the proposed theory based on the fact that we have dimensioned a conceptual and methodological algorithm that was applied and generated results allowing the interpretation of the feasibility of a global capital market between financial reporting theory and practice.","Accounting practices; Accounting regulations; Capital market; Feasibility; Theory","Accounting practices; Capital markets; Content analysis; Feasibility; Financial assets; Financial reporting; Global capitals; Similitude degree; Theory; Theory and practice; Industry; Commerce",,,,,"Ball, R., Kothari, S.P., Robin, A., The effect of international institutional factors on properties of accounting earnings (2000) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 29, pp. 1-52; Bonaci, C.G., Matis, D., Mustata, R.V., Framework for documenting national accounting practices' orientation towards IAS/IFRS (2010) Journal of International Management Studies, 10 (3), pp. 125-132; Dargenidou, C., McLeay, S., Raonic, I., Expected earnings growth and the cost of capital: An analysis of accounting regime change in the European financial market (2006) Abacus, 42 (3-4), pp. 388-414. , DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6281.2006.00207.x; Fontes, A., Rodrigues, L., Craig, R., Measuring convergence of national accounting standards with international financial reporting standards (2005) Accounting Forum, 29, pp. 415-236; Frost, C.A., Gordon, E.A., Hayes, A.F., Stock exchange disclosure and market development: An analysis of 50 international exchanges (2006) Journal of Accounting Research, 44 (3), pp. 437-483. , DOI 10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00208.x; Garrido, P., Leon, A., Zorio, A., Measurement of formal harmonization progress: The IASC experience (2002) The International Journal of Accounting, 37, pp. 1-26; Kang, T., Global market segmentation and patterns in stock market reaction to US earnings announcements: Further evidence (2005) Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting, 16 (2), pp. 123-141; Morais, A., Fialho, A., Do harmonized accounting standards lead to harmonized accounting practices?

Design/methodology/approach: Technology e-transfer is an innovating concept popularised in industry, especially in SMEs, developed in the course of the previously pursued e-foresight research of modern knowledge concerning the priority innovative materials surface technologies and the forecast directions of their development. Findings: Technology e-transfer embracing e-information, e-advisory and e-learning, is an efficient method of disseminating the results of technology e-foresight of materials surface engineering within industry. Research limitations/implications: If technology e-transfer is used in the Open Access mode, anyone, for free and at the same terms, has access to a database on the priority innovative technologies of materials surface engineering and the anticipated directions of their development, which has a positive effect on the development of a knowledge- and innovation-based economy. Practical implications: The idea of disseminating the results of e-foresight of materials surface engineering by way of technology e-transfer is especially attractive for small- and medium-sized companies lacking the funds required to perform their own research in this scope. Originality/value: The concept of technology e-transfer represents the Authors' original contribution into the development of Computer Aided Knowledge Management. © Copyright by International OCSCO World Press.","E-delphix method; Surface engineering; Technology e-foresight; Technology e-transfer; The critical technologies book",,,,,,"Man, F., (2003) The Future of Manufacturing in Europe 2015-2020, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrialtechnologies/pdf/pro-futman-doc3a.pdf, The Challenge for Sustainability; Materials; Final Report; Groupe CM International; Dreher, C., Vis, M., Manufacturing visions: A holistic view of the trends for European manufacturing (2007) Advanced Manufacturing, , in: M.

Although the legal standard for probable cause is the same, and the facts that might support cause are the same, judges who assess probable cause in hindsight invariably know whether a search produced incriminating evidence or not. Research on the hindsight bias suggests that judges will be unable to set aside this knowledge and judge probable cause as if they were working in foresight. In this article, we present three experiments in which we asked 900 state and federal judges to make judgments of probable cause either in foresight or in hindsight, in hypothetical cases. Surprisingly, we found that that judges make similar rulings on probable cause in foresight and in hindsight. We also found that hindsight appears to cloud judges' abilities to assess the likely outcome of the search, but hindsight does not influence their legal judgments. © 2011 Cornell Law School and Wiley Subscription Services, Inc.",,,,,,,"The Fourth Amendment states: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized; The police must, whenever practical, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure , pp. 752-762. , Chimel v California, 395 U.S; Katz, V., searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment (1967), pp. 347-357. , United States, 389 U.S; Stuntz, W.J., (1991) Warrants and Fourth Amendment Remedies, 77, pp. 881-882; Bradley, C.M., (1985) Two Models of the Fourth Amendment Remedies, 83, pp. 1468-1473; Fischhoff, B., Hindsight ?

Specifically, the judges were given the question ""Will you rule to suppress the evidence?"" and two options: ""Yes, there was probable cause to justify the search"" and ""No, there was not probable cause to justify the search."" Nevertheless, most of the judges reported understanding what the question was asking, and so we include these results here. Also, as discussed, their results did not differ from those of the federal magistrate judges later tested in Minneapolis or the Ohio judges, for whom we corrected the error; Fisher's exact test, p = 0.44; This analysis assumes that our estimate of the population percentage in foresight is 23 percent, or 26 out of 113 judges, which is what we obtained.

If the population percentage in hindsight is 43 percent (20 percent higher than in foresight), we would have had a 98.9 percent chance of observing 36 or more judges determining that probable cause was present; z = 1.80, p = 0.07 for the main effect of gender. Throughout this article, we test the results of any logistic regression as the z score of the coefficient of the logistic regression equation, with accompanying p value. All statistics were conducted with Stata; We did not ask judges in the eastern jurisdiction or this group of U.S. magistrate judges to identify their political orientation; Fisher's exact test, p = 0.11; This analysis assumes that our estimate of the population percentage in foresight is 57 percent, or 68 out of 119 judges, which is what we obtained. With 105 judges in hindsight, 72 or more finding that there was probable cause would produce a marginally significant effect, or p = 0.10, using Fisher's exact test. If the population percentage in hindsight is 73 percent (20 percent higher than in foresight), we would have had a 95 percent chance of observing 72 or more judges who concluded that there was probable cause; In no case did we obtain a significant interaction between a demographic variable and the type of crime, nor were any of the three-way interactions between the demographic variable, type of crime, and perspective significant; z = 1.70, p = 0.09; Main effect for crime, F(1, 198) = 1.36, p = 0.25; main effect for perspective, F(1, 198) = 0.83, p = 0.36; interaction, F(1, 198) = 0.05, p = 0.82; F(1, 193) = 27.82, p < 0.001; The mean estimates in foresight and hindsight were reported in Table 3. This analysis differs in that it controls for the judges' ruling to produce the marginally significant effect of perspective. F(1, 193) = 3.04, p = 0.08; F(1, 193) = 3.51, p = 0.06; We obtained this cutoff and the statistics in this paragraph using the ""lstat"" command in Stata, run immediately after the logistic regression of judges choice on their probability estimates; McCauliff, C.M.A., Burdens of Proof: Degrees of Belief, Quanta of Evidence, or Constitutional Guarantees? (1982) Vand. L. Rev., 35, pp. 1293-1327; Fisher's exact test, p = 0.14; This analysis assumes that our estimate of the population percentage in foresight is 45 percent, or 33 out of 72 judges, which is what we obtained. With 77 judges in hindsight, 46 or more finding that there was probable cause would produce a marginally significant effect, or p = 0.10, using Fisher's exact test. This is only one more than we actually observed. If the population percentage in hindsight is 65 percent (20 percent higher than in foresight), we would have had a 83.2 percent chance of observing 46 or more judges who concluded that there was probable cause; z = 2.01, p = 0.04; z = 1.88, p = 0.06; t(172) = 3.05, p < 0.005; t(68) = 0.58, p = 0.56; t(45) = 0.12, p = 0.91; t(89) = 0.91, p = 0.36; F(1,169) = 10.83, p = 0.001; F(1,169) = 0.02 p = 0.90; F(1,169) = 1.77, p = 0.19; Experience was treated as continuous, using ANCOVA; F(1, 164) = 2.58, p = 0.11; t(100) = 1.33, p = 0.18; We assumed that the hindsight condition would shift the probability estimates upwards by 11.9 percent-which is the shift we observed in Scenario 3. To calculate the power, we used the standard deviation we obtained in the Ohio judges, which was 30.1 (assuming it was uniform across both conditions) and a p value of 0.10; An ANOVA of the probability estimates in both scenarios with perspective, scenario, and an interaction term produced a significant interaction. F(1, 271) = 8.43, p < 0.005; F(1, 1,98) = 3.78, p = 0.06; F(1,93) = 4.28, p = 0.04; F(1, 93) = 0.18, p = 0.67; Wells, G.L., Naked Statistical Evidence of Liability: Is Subjective Probability Enough? (1992) J. Personality & Soc. Psychol., 62, p. 739; Fisher's exact test, p = 0.36. We also regressed (using logistic regression) the ruling on perspective and two dummy coded variables to identify the studies to control for the effect of the different fact patterns, and similarly observed no significant effect for the perspective. z = 0.99, p = 0.32; We did not conduct a combined analysis for probability estimates because the methods varied across conditions. Notably, all the judges who reviewed the second scenario first made rulings. The hindsight bias we observed in Study 2 emerged only after we controlled for the judges' ruling; Main effect, z = 1.39, p = 0.16; interaction z = 0.07, p = 0.95. As with the individual studies, we conducted three separate logistic regressions of the judges' ruling on the perspective, each demographic variable, and an interaction term to identify the effect of the demographic variable, the results of which we report below. In each model, we also included two dummy codes to control for the differences between the scenarios (although we did not include interaction terms with the dummy codes for the scenarios). We did not combine the data for the probability estimates; Main effect, z = 2.12, p = 0.03; interaction, z = 0.93, p = 0.35; Main effect, z = 1.83, p = 0.07; interaction, z = 0.35, p = 0.73; Guthrie, C., Rachlinski, J.J., Wistrich, A.J., Blinking on the Bench: How Judges Decide Cases (2007) Cornell L.

The group developed a four-step multidisciplinary and participatory methodology that defined the objectives, established a shared diagnosis of the issue raised in the regional cash crop sector, implemented a foresight analysis, and then created a graphical summary. Three types of working groups (steering, restricted, and expanded) were involved with well-assigned tasks. The dynamic interactions between the different groups of stakeholders and scientists and the use of graphics and maps as a medium to identify critical areas, such as zones in which production or environmental issues, are declining or evolving, enabled a shared view of regional problems. The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of a participative methodology that enabled co-construction of three shared scenarios based on the combination of five major uncertainties: (i) change in agricultural markets and international trade; (ii) urbanization and regional planning; (iii) changing patterns of consumption and product processing; (iv) environmental issues in public policies; and (v) ability of farmers to implement innovative tools and methods. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Cash crop sector; Foresight analysis; Participatory method; Regional level",,,,,,"Abecassis, J., Bergez, J.E., (2010) Les Filières Céréalières: Organisation Et Nouveaux Défis, , (coord.), Quae Editions; Alcamo, J., Environmental Futures (2008) The Practice of Environmental Scenario Analysis, , (ed), Developments, integrated environmental assessment 2.

The organisation may anticipate the crisis or opportunity through foresight. It may have sufficient agility - being quick-footed and quick witted - to manage even unforeseen situations well. It may have the resilience to suffer relatively little damage, even when the situation impacts on it. Finally, even if damaged by a crisis situation, it may know how to institute a quick recovery, so that normal operations can be resumed. However, the capacity to survive a crisis cannot be developed when the crisis occurs; it must be developed ahead of time. This chapter deals with the four strategies of foresight, agility, resilience and recovery; for each, it explains the qualities that allow an organisation to prepare for the situations that arise. The author describes how action learning can be used to develop those qualities and embed them throughout an organisation. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

One widely spread methodology in technology foresight is Godet's Scenario Method, which includes a module (MICMAC) performing the so-called structural analysis. The goal of the structural analysis is to identify the most important variables in a system. To this end, it makes use of an influence matrix that describes the relations between the variables. This information is usually given by experts based on their own knowledge and experience. However, some of the information of the influence matrix may contain errors due to the subjective nature of the criteria and opinions of the experts. Here we propose a new analysis that follows a multi-objective approach and allows to measure the sensibility of the model versus possible errors at the input. The well-known NSGA-II algorithm has been used as a solver. The results are encouraging and deserve further investigation. © 2011 IEEE.","Godet's method; multiobjective optimization; scenario method; technology foresight","Godet's method; Influence matrix; Knowledge and experience; Multi objective; NSGA-II algorithm; scenario method; technology foresight; Errors; Intelligent systems; Multiobjective optimization; Structural analysis; Systems analysis; Innovation",,,,,"Godet, M., How to be rigorous with scenario planning (2000) Prospective, 2 (1), pp. 5-9; Durance, P., Godet, M., Scenario building: Uses and abuses (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Science, 77 (9), pp. 1488-1492; Godet, M., (1987) Scenarios and Strategic Management, , Butterworth-Heinemann; Godet, M., Creating Futures: Scenario Planning as Strategic Management Tool (2006) Economica; Bettencourt, R., Strategic prospective for the implementation of employment policies in the Azores (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (9), pp. 1566-1574; Lee, Y.-C., Chao, Y.H., Lin, S.-B., Structural approach to design user interface (2010) Computers in Industry, 61 (7), pp. 613-623; Deb, K., (2001) Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, , John Wiley and Sons; Levenshtein, V., Binary codes capable of correcting deletions, insertions, and reversals (1966) Soviet Physics, Doklady, 10 (8), pp. 707-710; Wagner, R.A., Fischer, M.J., The string-to-string correction problem (1974) Journal of the ACM, 21 (1), pp. 168-173; Deb, K., Agrawal, S., Pratap, A., Meyarivan, T., A Fast Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization: NSGA-II (2000) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1917. , ser.

We investigated the impact of this impatient relationship to temporality on adherence to medication and HbA 1c level in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional monocenter study in 90 patients consulting for a health check-up at a Center for Preventive Medicine. We used questionnaires assessing adherence to medication, impatience in a fictive monetary choice (preferring a smaller amount now to a higher amount later) and in daily life situations, foresight, locus of control, and social deprivation. Results: Impatience in the monetary choice was associated with non-adherence to medication (P=0.005). In a multivariate logistic regression model, the risk of observing HbA 1c≥7% was associated with a long duration of diabetes (OR 5.2, CI 1.7-15.7, P=0.003), monetary impatience (OR=5.1, CI 1.7-15.4, P=0.004), a high ""chance and other people"" score of the locus of control (OR=5.1, CI 1.7-15.7, P=0.004), a suboptimal foresight (OR 3.9, CI 1.2-12.0, P=0.02). A decision-tree analysis (CHAID algorithm) showed that in this cohort of 90 patients, the 11 people who were adherent to medication, patient in the monetary scenario, had optimal foresight, and gave importance neither to chance nor to other people, had all HbA 1c below 7%. Conclusion: An impatient relationship to temporality was found associated with non-adherence to medication and uncontrolled HbA 1c in type 2 diabetic patients. Treatment strategies for chronic diseases should be tailored according to this novel dimension of psychology. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Adherence; Clinical myopia; Foresight; Impatience; Locus of control; Monetary choice; Social deprivation; Temporal horizon; Type 2 diabetes","hemoglobin A1c; adult; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes control; disease association; female; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; patient attitude; patient compliance; social isolation; treatment outcome; Choice Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Trees; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; France; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Logistic Models; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Questionnaires; Self Care; Socioeconomic Factors",,"hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Hypoglycemic Agents",,,"Ainslie, G., Précis of Breakdown of will (2005) Behav Brain Sci, 28, pp. 635-650; Rachlin, H., Raineri, A., Cross, D., Subjective probability and delay (1991) J Exp Anal Behav, 55, pp. 233-244; Bickel, W.K., Miller, M.L., Yi, R., Kowal, B.P., Lindquist, D.M., Pitcock, J.A., Behavioral and neuroeconomics of drug addiction: competing neural systems and temporal discounting processes (2007) Drug Alcohol Dependence, 90 S, pp. S85-S91; Christakou, A., Brammer, M., Rubia, K., Maturation of limbic corticostriatal activation and connectivity associated with developmental changes in temporal discounting (2011) Neuroimage, 54, pp. 1344-1354; Boettiger, C.A., Mitchell, J.M., Tavares, V.C., Robertson, M., Joslyn, G., D'Esposito, M., Immediate reward bias in humans: fronto-parietal networks and a role for the catechol-O-methyltransferase 158 val/val genotype (2007) J Neurosci, 27, pp. 14383-14391; Reach, G., Personal view: is there an impatience genotype leading to non-adherence to long term therapies?

Most modeling exercises use the Critical Path Method (CPM) since it is simple to use and versatile, despite its lack of versatility. Almost all other modeling techniques are aimed at specialized types of construction work, such as linear scheduling which is used for modeling work that progresses along a line. Discrete-event simulation, while extremely versatile, lacks the simplicity in use of CPM and so has not been widely adopted within the industry. This paper goes back to first principles, identifying the needs of construction project planning and how existing tools meet (or fail to meet) these requirements. Based on this, it proposes a new modeling paradigm, Foresight, better suited to contemporary construction project planning. The principles of the method and its relative merits are demonstrated relative to conventional simulation in a series of construction case studies. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Construction process; Construction projects; Construction works; Critical path method; Discrete events; First-principles; Modeling paradigms; Modeling technique; Turnaround time; Construction industry",,,,,"Ceric, V., Hierarchical Abilities of Diagrammatic Representations of Discrete-Event Simulation Models (1994) Proceedings of the 1994 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 589-594. , eds.

The fourth stage of the project realization was its core and dealt with conducting research with various methods to evaluate innovativeness of technologies dealing with coal mining waste management and the influence of certain factors [2, 3, 5, 6]. One of the methods used for this research was the Del-phi method. It is based on structural research incorporating experience and knowledge of the research participants who are the experts in given areas. In the project, the Delphi method involves triple surveys, so that the results of previous survey were the source and basis for conducting the next one. In those surveys 170 experts have been involved, who represented hard coal mining, local administration and science sector [5]. In the Foresight OGWK Project, the survey included three thematic are-as: Part I Evaluation and prioritizing strategic and particular objectives of hard coal waste management, Part II Evaluation of technological issues of hard coal waste management, Part III Estimation of directions of research and development of hard coal waste management [5]. The evaluation of innovativeness of hard coal mining waste management technology with the Delphi method reflects the hierarchy of dealing with waste according to the Act of extractive waste meaning: preventing, minimizing and economic use of resources. As the prior goal, the experts indicated ""Full usage of waste currently and previously produced by hard coal mining"" under-lining that the possibility of reaching that goal depends on creating appropriate legal and fiscal mechanisms promoting the use of waste resources. Through the evaluation of the hierarchy in the importance of criteria influencing the innovativeness of waste management technologies the experts recognized that regardless the economic use of the waste the most important is financial criterion and technical & technological one. According to the experts the chances of technological development in particular directions of economic use of the waste result mainly from the accessibility of the waste and the necessity of minimizing mining exploitation effects, on the other hand the problems may result from the necessity of creating additional infrastructure and lack of financial means. The experts also claim that there is an urgent need of conducting re-search and development works on new innovative technologies of using hard coal mining waste and on issuing technical requirements for reclamation works. To conclude, it must be stated that there is an urgent need of creating complete hard coal mining waste management plan, creating legal and institutional conditions facilitating technological development of mining sector and providing financial instruments supporting technological initiatives in the subject of hard coal mining waste management.",,,,,,,"Baic, I., Góralczyk, S., Foresight"" w zakresie priorytetowych i innowacyj-nych technologii zagospodarowania odpadów pochodzacych z górnictwa wegla kamiennego (2010) Monografia Paliwo - Bezpieczeństwo - Środowisko, ITG KOMAG, , Gliwice; Berkhout, F., Hertin, J., Foresight Futures Scenarios: Developing and Applying a Participative Strategic Planning Tool (2000) GMI Newsletter; Coates, J.F., Mahaffie, J.B., Hines, A., (1998) 2025: Scenarios of US and Global Society Reshaped By Science and Technology, , Greensboro, Oakhill Press; Kudełko, M., Kamiński, J., Kaszyński, P., (2010) Foresight OGWK - Metoda Delphi - Raport Z Przeprowadzonej Ankietyzacji, , Instytut Gospodarki Su-rowcami Mineralnymi i Energia PAN Kraków; (2009) Foresight OGWK - Priorytetowe I Innowacyjne Technolo-gie Zagospodarowania Odpadów Pochodzacych Z Górnictwa Wegla Kamien-nego - Etap IV, , Praca zbiorowa, Warszawa; Rotman, J., Cloudy Crystal Balls: An Assessment of Recent European and Global Scenario Studies and Models (2000) Experts Corner Report: Prospects and Scenarios, , Copenhagen: European Environment Agency","Baic, I.; Instytut Mechanizacji Budownictwa i Górnictwa Skalnego, Katowice, Poland",,,,,,,,1506218X,,,,"English; Polish","Rocz.

It involves strategy formulation in combination with an analysis of the likely evolution of the business environment, in order to detect and handle opportunities and threats that arise from emerging trends. Strategic simulation is the combination of narrative and numerical simulation and can be used as a tool to support strategic decision making by providing different scenarios in combination with computer modelling. The core of the combined simulation approach (CSA) is to make it possible for decision makers to systematically test several different outputs of possible solutions in order to prepare for future consequences. This paper contributes to the decision making in operations and production management by providing new insights into modelling and simulation based on the combined narrative and numerical simulation approach as a tool for strategy making. The research question asks, ""How can the CSA be applied in a practical context to support strategy making?""

Such researchers produce knowledge that when is turned into product, it would bring wealth and synergy into the society and economy. Universities in developing countries follow the same patterns as in developed nations for training PhD graduates. The industries in the developing countries on their turn make use of foreign designs and are not able to invest on lesser attractive domestic products where cost of research, design and development would far exceed the license fee of a readily imported design. This makes it hard to find research fields in industry that would absorb PhD graduates and therefore ends the research cycle in the universities. This paper studies different aspects of PhD training from a developing country prospective. Although the test case is in Iran but we believe that this can be similar to other developing countries where industry has not grown on the same level as universities. After an overall analysis, a test case is introduced on an engineering department to show different aspects of course management, its content and a foresight into the future path. It shows that although poor industrial relations has pushed research and graduates into an academic cycle but students and graduates are ready and demonstrate the need for joint PhD research topics with industry. © Common Ground, Nader Montazerin, Mohsen Bahrami, Masoud Nikkhoo.","Discriminant analysis; Future research; Higher education; PhD Course; Simultaneous regression",,,,,,"Abeles, T.P., (2005) All professors as philosophers; not, all philosophers as professors, 13 (3), pp. 135-137. , Editorial, on the horizon, Emerald Group Publishing Limited; Altbach, P.G., (2005) A world class country without a world class higher education: India's 21st century dilemma, International higher education, 40, pp. 18-20. , http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/soe/cihe/newsletter/Number40/p18_Altbach.htm, Available; Batterburry, S., Hill, S., Assessing the impact of higher education on regional development: Using a realist approach for policy enhancement (2004) Higher Education Management and Policy, 16 (3), pp. 35-52; Connell, R.W., How to supervise a PhD (1985) Vestes, 28 (2), pp. 38-41; Delamont, S., Atkinson, P., Parry, O., (1998) Supervising the PhD: a guide to success, , Open University Press Buckingham; Delvin, M., Tjia, T., Beyond satisfaction surveys: The development of an evaluation process for a postgraduate transferable skills program (2004) Issues in educational research, 14; Epstein, D., Kenway, J., Boden, R., (2005) Teaching and supervision, Sage Publications, , London; Fehnel, R., Higher education reforms and demand responsive innovation funds: Dimensions of Difference (2004) A report to the world bank; Frame, I.A., Allen, L., A flexible approach to PhD research training (2002) Quality Assurance in Education, 12 (2), pp. 98-103; Gemme, B., The changing career preferences of doctoral students (2005) Annual meeting of the American educational Research Association; Giret, J.F., Recotillet, I., The impact of CIFRE program into early careers of PhD graduates in France (2004) 16th Annual Conference of the European Association of Labor Economists, , Lisbon; Harman, G., Producing PhD Graduates in Australia for The Knowledge Economy (2002) Higher Education Research & Development, 21 (2), pp. 179-189; Iain, A.F., Allen, l., A flexible approach to PhD research training (2002) Quality Assurance in Education, 12 (2), pp. 98-103; Johnson, G.R., Are We the Last Generation for Whom an Academic Career Will be Meaningful?

Standing at the heart of their businesses and providing a link between executives and employees, these managers need to limit the impact of the crisis in an environment in which various constraints, unexpected events and social tensions are on the increase. Restructuring and cost-killing are the first port of call, which makes buyers very busy people. However, some buyers are pioneering a new kind of collaborative management which, instead of increasing the pressure on suppliers and reducing risk-taking to a minimum, advocates taking new initiatives that are not aimed solely at maximising profits in the short-term. This article offers an overview of this new, foresight-based Procurement practice. After highlighting recent Procurement function developments, which were largely responsible for the consequences of the crisis, our constructivist methodology proposes to interview 12 buying experts in order to develop scenarios and identify the features of the Collaborative Procurement. The final section then presents: (1) new forms of internal and external collaboration; (2) the roles and specific skills of this type of the ""buyer of the future""; and (3) how the globalised economy is becoming an increasingly community-based, collaborative virtual environment. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Collaboration; Collaborative buyer; Economic crisis; Foresight; Procurement function","Collaboration; Collaborative buyer; Collaborative management; Collaborative virtual environment; Economic crisis; Foresight; New forms; Procurement practices; Risk taking; Social tensions; Unexpected events; High pressure effects; Management; Managers; Profitability; Sales; Virtual corporation; Human resource management",,,,,"Allal-Cherif, O., (2007) An Economic Model for Electronic Marketplaces, , PhD thesis in Management Sciences, University of Grenoble 2, UPMF (May); Bakos, J.Y., Reducing buyer search costs: Implications for electronic marketplaces (1997) Management Science, 43 (12), pp. 1676-1692; Ballaz, B., Le management des achats et de la chaîne intégrée clients-fournisseurs: le ôle clé du système d'information.

The tool most often used by decision makers for choosing a strategic objective is the analysis of indicators resulting from cash flow projections.

We advocate models of creative cognition to rethink simulation modeling so that creativity is enhanced rather than stifled. Generative Parallax Simulation (GPS) is introduced as a strategy and a generic and abstract specification for its realization is presented. GPS is based on an evolving ecology of ensembles of models that aim to cope with ambiguity, which pervades in early phases of model-based science and engineering.

Individuals can act on their own account (Aked et al, 2008), but public sector organisations could take more advantage of the 'feel good - do well' dynamic, not only as employers but as policy makers, commissioners and service providers. Building on the capabilities and resources of individuals and communities also offers institutions an opportunity to mitigate financial and policy constraints. This paper describes an approach to public mental health in an inner London borough and the opportunities for, and barriers to, strategic change. Results are encouraging but emphasise the importance of taking a long view, senior leadership, dedicated capacity for cross-sector coordination, evidence and measurement, dogged persistence, and a balance of vision and opportunism.","Happiness; Lambeth; Mental health; Mental health promotion; Mental wellbeing; Public mental health; Wellbeing",,,,,,"Aked, J., Marks, N., Cordon, C., Thompson, S., (2008) Five Ways to Wellbeing: The Evidence.

This means that the ramifications of systemic transformations flow through this meta-system faster than before and that these flows have complex effects. Due to this systemic complexity, the implications are also harder to anticipate. Research and technology organisations (RTOs), as key nodes in the innovation meta-system, should therefore develop at least two systemic capacities: 1) partial structural openness and fluidity that enable flexibility in responding to the systemic flows and 2) a horizontal anticipatory culture that integrates the critical knowledge in an RTO to build an internal future-oriented agency, anticipatory capacity and foresight sensibility. In this paper we propose that practices of technology roadmapping could be applied to building these strategic capacities in an RTO. We exemplify these roadmapping practices by briefly analysing a selected development process at VTT, namely VTT's Service Science and Business Network, as a case study.",,"Business networks; Complex effects; Development process; Flowthrough; Geographical scale; Innovation system; Research networks; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Service science; Technology roadmapping; Innovation; Research",,,,,"Arnold, E., Clark, J., Jávorka, Z., Impacts of European RTOs.

It is argued that specific features of Malaysian education and political economy, with their attendant racial fixations, are contributing to the country's brain drain. Although there is a lack of consensus about the actual economic impact of the brain drain, the Malaysian government continues to dedicate substantial amounts of time, energy and resources into 'talent' initiatives with the aim of training and retaining domestic talent, while simultaneously luring highly-skilled foreign migrants to Malaysia and enticing the diaspora to return home. Drawing on interviews and observations from public universities and the burgeoning civil society sector in Malaysia, and supplemented by content analysis of recent films and theatre performances, this paper argues that most government initiatives have been undermined by a lack of foresight attributed largely to the straightjacket of Malaysian electoral politics and perennially 'sensitive' communal relations.","Brain drain; Education; Ethnicity; Malaysian; Political economy; Youth",,,,,,"Ahmat, S., Nation-building and the university in developing countries: The case of Malaysia (1980) Higher Education, 9 (6), pp. 721-741; Arfah, S., Research: A future for mixed marriages (2011) New Straits Times, , 8 October 2011; Balaz, V., Williams, A.M., Kollar, D., Temporary versus permanent youth brain drain: Economic implications (2004) International Migration, 42 (4), pp. 3-34. , DOI 10.1111/j.0020-7985.2004.00293.x; Case, W., Interlocking elites in Southeast Asia (2003) Comparative Sociology, 2 (1), pp. 249-269. , Elite configurations at the apex of power; Chew, D., Racial quotas widen social gaps, not rectify them (2001) The Japan Times, , 25 May 2001; Cho, G., (1990) The Malaysian Economy: Spatial Perspectives, , London: Routledge; Crouch, H.A., (1996) Government and Society in Malaysia, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Dick, H.W., The rise of a middle class and the changing concept of equity in Indonesia: An interpretation (1985) Indonesia, 39, pp. 71-92. , April; Gerke, S., Global lifestyles under local conditions: The new Indonesian middle class (2000) Consumption in Asia: Lifestyles and Identities, pp. 135-158. , ed.

Their foresight and the congruence of historical events made their work the first modern paper in numerical analysis. Von Neumann once remarked that to found a mathematical theory one had to prove the first theorem, which he and Goldstine did for the accuracy of mechanized Gaussian elimination-but their paper was about more than that.

Communicating the environmental benefits of products and the importance of wasting less food, supporting honest environmental labelling and defining methodologies for sustainable food will help inform these choices. Government initiatives to support sustainable fish species consumption, reconnect people with food and work towards a zero-waste economy will help to tackle environmental and climate change impacts. The Government is committed to addressing global challenges identified by Foresight to meet increasing food demand with less environmental impact. Evidence to underpin sustainable food policy requires a joined-up approach across funders, industry and the third sector to strengthen research activity and maximise impact. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs' research and development targets the whole food chain from production to consumption. Activity addresses sustainability and resource efficiency; environmental impacts; supply chain and consumer drivers, behaviours and practice; explores synergies, trade-offs and tensions; and ways to promote availability and take up of sustainable healthy food. © 2011 Crown.

Alternative ways for financing projects were sought after by real estate developers worldwide. Within Asia, notably in Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, a number of reputable property developers have been tapping the capital debt market for funds in recent years amidst an increasingly regulated loan market and competitive pricing. In the face of a growing bond market, some corporate bond issues arranged by these property developers have been successful. Apart from investment appetite, property developers have to gauge carefully the pros and cons of raising funds through bond issues. Successful bond issues need to be structured with suitable credit enhancement features since the perception of risk and rising interest rates are major deterrents to potential investors who would otherwise face bond defaults or bear high opportunity costs with the committed funds. Through a number of case studies, the suitability of bond financing for property development is compared with loan financing. It is found that a close monitoring of market conditions and some foresight are essential ingredients for successful bond financing, for both straight bond issues and convertibles. © 2011 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","Bonds; Capital structure; Convertibles; Loans; Real estate developers",,,,,,"Adair, A., Berry, J., Hutchison, N., McGreal, S., Attracting institutional investment into regeneration: Necessary conditions for effective funding (2007) Journal of Property Research, 24 (3), pp. 221-240. , doi:10.1080/09599910701599282; (1997) Asian Wall Street Journal, , AWSJ, 29 October; (2009) The Asian Debt Markets Newsletter, (832). , Basis Point, Issue, 25 May 2009; (2010) The Asian Debt Markets Newsletter, (871). , Basis Point, Issue, 8 March 2010; Beveridge, J., (1988) The Needs of the Property Company, , Real Estate Finance, Stephen, L.

Some advocate the necessity of single renewable energy paradigm, but its realization is potentially fraught with difficulty owing to technological challenges, existing sunk costs, and path dependencies associated with existing and emerging options. It could also result in disadvantageous outcomes to emerging economies. Another school of thought proposes that future road transport, even within single nations, will require multiple energy types, mainly because a single source will be insufficient to meet projected needs. A multiple paradigm has the potential to be expensive because several infrastructures have to be implemented simultaneously. This paper aims to assess both concepts by considering the largely neglected dimensions of resource location and regional geophysical attributes, in addition to national technical expertise, industry capacity and modal factors. Case studies from both the developed world (the European Union and Australia) and the developing world (sub-Saharan Africa and China) will assess the possibility of implementing a single transport energy paradigm versus a more pluralistic regime. The results will help to inform policy making and enable greater foresight with regard to making long-term transport infrastructure investment decisions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"alternative energy; energy planning; energy policy; energy resource; European Union; future prospect; geopolitics; policy making; renewable resource; Australia; China; Europe; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,"(2008), ABS, Research and Development, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Year Book Australia, Canberra; Agbakwa, S.C., A path least taken: economic and social rights and the prospects of conflict prevention and peacebuilding in Africa (2003) Journal of African Law, 47 (1), pp. 38-64; Al-Riffai, P., Dimaranan, B., Laborde, D., (2010), Global trade and environmental impact study of the EU biofuels mandate, Atlass Consortium; Armand, M., Tarascon, J.M., Building better batteries (2008) Nature, 451 (7), pp. 652-657; Bardi, U., Peak oil: the four stages of a new idea (2009) Energy, 34 (3), pp. 323-326; Beer, T., Grant, T., Morgan, G., Lapszewicz, J., Anyon, P., Edwards, J., Nelson, P., Williams, D., (2006) Comparison of Transport Fuels: Final Report (EV45a/2/F3C) to the Australian Greenhouse Office on the Stage 2 Study of Life-cycle Emissions Analysis of Alternative Fuels for Heavy Vehicles, , CSIRO, Canberra; Bilgin, M., Geopolitics of European natural gas demand: supplies from Russia, Caspian and the Middle East (2009) Energy Policy, 37 (11), pp. 4482-4492; Bilgin, M., New energy order and FAST principles: premises of equitable and sustainable energy security in the 21st century (2010) International Journal of Global Energy Issues, 33 (1-2), pp. 4-21; Black, A., Globalization and restructuring in the South African automotive industry (2001) Journal of International Development, 13 (6), pp. 779-796; Blanchard, R., (2000) The Impact of Declining Major North Sea Oil Fields Upon Future North Sea Production, , Northern Kentucky University, Highland Heights, KY; Bomb, C., McCormick, K., Deurwaarder, E.P., Kaberger, T., Biofuels for transport in Europe: lessons from Germany and the UK (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (4), pp. 2256-2267; Brown, M.A., Levine, M.D., Short, W., Koome, J.G., Scenarios for a clean energy future (2001) Energy Policy, 29 (14), pp. 1179-1196; Brown, M.B., Canzler, W., Fischer, F., Knie, A., Technological innovation through environmental policy: California's zero-emission vehicle regulation (1995) Public Productivity & Management Review, 19 (1), pp. 77-93; Campbell, C., The Rimini Protocol an oil depletion protocol: heading off economic chaos and political conflict during the second half of the age of oil (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (12), pp. 1319-1325; Carmody, P., Constructing alternatives to structural adjustment in Africa (1998) Review of African Political Economy, 25 (75), pp. 25-46; Cassman, K.G., Liska, A.J., Food and fuel for all: realistic or foolish?

In light of this background, we borrow from systems engineering and business management to present the concept of service co-production as a new paradigm for healthcare delivery and, using the foresight afforded by this model, to systematically identify the barriers to healthcare delivery functioning as a service system. The service co-production model requires for patient, provider, insurer, administrator, and all the related healthcare individuals to collaborate at all stages - prevention, triage, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up - of the healthcare delivery system in order to produce optimal health outcomes. Our analysis reveals that the barriers to co-production - the misalignment of financial and legal incentives, limited incorporation of collaborative point of care systems, and poor access to care - also serve as the source of many of the systemic failings of the U.S. healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act takes steps to reduce these barriers, but leaves work to be done. Future research and policy reform is needed to enable effective and efficient co-production in the twenty-first century. With this review, we assess the state of service co-production in the U.S. healthcare system, and propose solutions for improvement. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"(2004) Literacy and Health Outcomes, , http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/literacy/literacy.pdf, Agency for Health Research and Quality, Retrieved from; (2002) Healthcare Costs Fact Sheet, , http://www.ahrq.gov/news/costsfact.htm, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, (AHRQ Publication No. 02-P033).

The study argues that playwrights were writing with foresight, inscribing the constraints and resources of the stages into their texts. It goes further, to posit that Shakespeare and his playwright-contemporaries adhered to a set of generic conventions, rather than specific local company practices, about how space and place were to be related in performance: the playwrights constituted thus an overarching virtual 'company' producing playtexts that shared features across the acting companies and playhouses. By clarifying a sixteenth- to seventeenth-century conception of theatrical place, Tim Fitzpatrick adds a new layer of meaning to our understanding of the plays. His approach adds a new dimension to these particular documents whichthough many of them are considered of great literary worthwere not originally generated for any other reason than to be performed within a specific performance context. The fact that the playwrights were aware of the features of this performance tradition makes their texts a potential mine of performance information, and casts light back on the texts themselves: if some of their meanings are 'spatial', these will have been missed by purely literary tools of analysis. © Tim Fitzpatrick 2011.

The project involves novel methods for the development of plausible visions of nanotechnology-enabled futures, elucidates public preferences for various alternatives, and, using such preferences, helps refine future visions for research and outreach. In doing so, the NanoFutures project aims to address a central question: how to deliberate the social implications of an emergent technology whose outcomes are not known. The solution pursued by the NanoFutures project is twofold. First, NanoFutures limits speculation about the technology to plausible visions. This ambition introduces a host of concerns about the limits of prediction, the nature of plausibility, and how to establish plausibility. Second, it subjects these visions to democratic assessment by a range of stakeholders, thus raising methodological questions as to who are relevant stakeholders and how to activate different communities so as to engage the far future. This article makes the dilemmas posed by decisions about such methodological issues transparent and therefore articulates the role of plausibility in anticipatory governance. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Deliberation; Foresight; Plausibility; Social implications of nanotechnology","article; consumer; demography; human; motivation; nanotechnology; political system; research; social psychology; United States; university; Arizona; Consumer Participation; Consumer Satisfaction; Democracy; Goals; Humans; Nanotechnology; Research; Residence Characteristics; Social Values; Universities",,,,,"Arthur, W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by historical events (1989) The Economic Journal, 99, pp. 116-131; Barben, D., Fisher, E., Selin, C., Guston, D., Anticipatory governance of nanotechnology: Foresight, engagement, and integration (2008) The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies, pp. 979-1000. , 3rd edn., E.

With RFID technology companies around the world can reduce their workforce and grow their business. However, this technology is not at that maturity point yet. In order for a cart full of groceries to go through an unmanned checkout lane, it is crucial that all of the tagged items are read and processed with 100% reliability. Also the process time needs to be short so that customers complete their purchases as fast as possible. In order to achieve time and reliability, several transmission control protocols have been devised. Out of these, the transmission control protocol that is most popular with RFID equipment manufacturers is EPCglobal's Class 1 Gen2. The transmission control in EPC C1G2 is achieved by framed slotted ALOHA where tags pick a random slot from the choices given by the reader and when their turn comes, they backscatter their information. This can lead to many empty slots and many collision slots apart from the successful slot. The time spent on these non-successful slots is studied in [4] and in this paper we extended the concept provided in [4] and propose a new method that scans for the empty and collided slots before attempting to read tags. © 2011 IEEE.","Collision detection; EPC Class1 Gen2; RFID; Scan","Collision detection; EPC Class1 Gen2; Equipment manufacturers; Framed slotted alohas; Medium access protocol; RFID Technology; Scan; Transmission control; Medium access control; Transmission control protocol; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",,,,,"(2005) EPC Generation 1 Tag Data Standards Version 1.1 Rev.1.27, , EPCglobal, May; EPC Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at 860 MHz - 960MHz Version 1.0.9 (2005) EPCglobal, , EPCglobal; Daneshmand, M., Chonggang, W., Sohraby, K., A new slot-count selection algorithm for RFID protocol (2007) Communications and Networking in China, CHINACOM '07; Liu, D., Wang, Z., Tan, J., Min, H., Wang, J., ALOHA Algorithm considering the Slot Duration Difference in RFID system (2009) IEEE International Conference on RFID; Namboodri, V., Pendse, R., Bit level synchronized mac protocol for multi-reader RFID networks (2010) Eurasip Journal of Wireless Communication Networks; Joshi, G.P., Abdulla Mamun, K.M., Kim, S.W., A reader anti-collision MAC protocol for dense reader RFID system (2009) Communications and Mobile Computing; Joshi, G.P., Abdulla Mamun, K.M., Kim, S.W., A reader anti-collision MAC protocol for dense reader RFID system (2009) Communications and Mobile Computing; Birari, S., Iyer, S., PULSE: A MAC protocol for RFID networks (2005) 1st International Workshop on RFID and Ubiquitous Sensor Networks (USN), , Nagasaki, Japan, Dec; Wang, C., Daneshmand, M., Sohraby, K., Li, B., Performance analysis of RFID generation-2 protocol (2009) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 8 (5). , May; http://www.eclipse.org/; Khasgiwala, R.S., Adyanthaya, R.U., Engels, D.W., Extracting information from tag collision (2009) IEEE International Conference on RFID","Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, United States",,,,"10th Annual Wireless Telecommunications Symposium, WTS 2011","13 April 2011 through 15 April 2011","New York City, NY",97941,19345070,9781457701627,,,"English","Wirel.

Adaptive or foresight planning is necessary in order to account and plan for potential risks that may increase or take place concurrently with climate change. Forests constitute relevant examples of large-scale renewable resource systems that have been directly affected by recent environmental and social changes, and where different levels of management may influence each other. This article views disturbances in the forest sectors of Sweden and Canada, two large forest nations with comparable forestry experiences, in order to elucidate the preparedness and existing responses to multiple potential stresses. The article concludes that the two countries are exposed to stresses that indicate the importance of the governing and institutional system particularly with regard to multi-level systems including federal and EU levels. While economic change largely results in privatization of risk onto individual companies and their economic resources (in Canada coupled with a contestation of institutional systems and equity in these), storm and pest outbreaks in particular challenge institutional capacities at administrative levels, within the context provided by governance and tenure systems. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Canada; Economic crisis; Forest pests; Forestry; Storms; Sweden","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Canada; Economic crisis; Forest pest; Sweden; Climate change; Privatization; Societies and institutions; Storms; Timber; Forestry; economic reform; environmental impact; European Union; financial crisis; forest management; forestry; privatization; renewable resource; social impact; Adaptation; Canada; Economic Analysis; Forests; Pests; Private Ownership; Seasonal Variation; Sweden; Canada; Sweden",,,,,"(2010) Developing Adaptation Policy and Practice in Europe: Multi-level Governance of Climate Change;, , Keskitalo, E.C.H., Ed.; Springer: Berlin, Germany; Blennow, K., Olofsson, E., The probability of wind damage in forestry under a changed wind climate (2008) Clim.

A large share, i.e. 34.4 million tonnes accounting for 26.6%, was mineral waste produced during coal mining and processing. Despite the economic use of such waste in rehabilitation of mining areas the amount of waste accumulated in waste heaps is growing and in 2007 (according to GUS) reached 0.5 billion tormes. It seems that according to abovementioned data the problem of effective and comprehensive use of mine waste is extremely valid. Certain positive trends are observed in the approach of Coal Companies due to Act on Extractive waste (OJ of 2008. No. 138, item. 865). The Act obliges producers to utilize and dispose waste in industrial facilities excluding some of the methods already used e.g. storage. Presented status gave fundaments for submitting the project titled ""Foresight for prioritized and innovative hard coal waste disposal technologies"". The project which is scheduled for implementation on 2009-2011 is coordi nated by Institute of Mechanised Construction and Rock Mining in Warsaw. Partners are: AGH University of Science and Technology and Silesian University of Technology. In the project certain investigations were carried out in order to identify leading technologies of mine waste disposal of strategic importance which in the next 20 years will be the priority for Poland. Certain scenarios of factors affecting the development of these technologies were prepared. The fourth stage of the OGWK Foresight project included core activity which was focused on carrying out the research with various methodologies on innovativeness of hard coal mining waste management and influence of selected factors on their development. The paper presents results of cross-impact analysis of selected factors on innovativeness of hard coal mining waste management technology. The cross-impact analysis were supported by MICMAC software which allowed identification of sets of factors with the most powerftil feedback effects. In total, six sets of arrays were analyzed, including five arrays of technological groups and one horizontal array representing strategic objectives factors. Cross-impact analysis were conducted in the following three stages: 1. Inventory of factor affecting the analyzed system (technology) development within the specific timeframe. 2. Determination of the relationship between selected factors and quantitative description of existing relationships with the use of cross-impact matrix. 3. Identification of key factors for the evolution of analyzed system (technology) within the specific timeframe. In the performed study experts were evaluating factors affecting implementation of strategic objectives (horizontal array) and evaluation of factors affecting development of technology in five thematic groups of hard coal waste usage. Survey results were used for the extensive analysis allowing identification of key factors in the considered processes. Conducted cross-impact analysis allowed to determine key factors in thematic groups of hard coal waste disposal technologies and in horizontal array factors.

Accordingly, this article discusses the concepts related to future studies and their historical trajectory by presenting the various classifications and approaches found in the literature characterizing their relations and theoretical gaps. Therefore, using the principles of the dialectical method, a descriptive theoretical study was conducted using literature review as the research method. This study presents a characterization of the concepts found in the studies investigated that are considered benchmark creating a timeline. Through a comparative analysis of the terms found, the focus was developing a conceptual framework suitable for the Brazilian scientific scenario concerning future studies. It was concluded that this is not a recent topic, and the existing concepts/classifications have received several contributions updating and expanding its specifications and operational complexities, since the 1950's. The originally generic approach has been replaced with more specific visions related to individual methods of investigation and future building achieving greater relevance, consistency, and replicability. The adoption of a certain classification (and its methods) must result from a historical and cultural identity with the context of application. It is believed that this research contributes to avoiding and or clearing theoretical misunderstandings, conceptual errors, or broad and indiscriminate use of synonymous concepts, which are sometimes found in the literature, presenting opportunities for future studies technical development.","Forecast; Foresight; Future scenarios; Future studies; Prospective",,,,,,"Amara, R., Forecasting, S.G., From conjectural art toward science (1972) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 3 (3), pp. 415-426. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0040-1625(71)80029-X; Amsteus, M., Managerial foresight: Concept and measurement (2008) Foresight, 10 (1), pp. 53-66. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/14636680810856026; Berger, G., (1964) Phénoménologie du Temps et Prospective, , Paris: PUF; Blair, P., (1994) Technology Assessment: Current Trends and the Myth of A Formula; Bodini, L., (2001) Uso da Análise Estrutural Prospectiva Para A Identificaç ão de Fatores Condicionantes da Competitividade Na Agroindústria Brasileira., , Tese (Doutorado em Engenharia de Produção)-Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis 2001; Borjeson, L., Towards a user's guide to scenarios: A report on scenario type and scenario techniques (2005) Environmental Strategies Research., , http://www.infra.kth.se/fms, Royal Institute of Technology, Acesso em : 05 set. 2006; Bouvier, Y., (2002) Une Histoire de la Prospective, , http://www.paris4.sorbonne.fr/html/recherche/ecol_et_cen/moderne/crhi/ pub4.htm, Paris: Sorbonne, Acesso em: 21 jan. 2003; Camargo, O., (2005) Uma Contribuição Metodológica Para Planejamento Estratégico de Corredores de Transporte de Carga Usando Cenários Prospectivos., , Tese (Doutorado em Engenharia de Produção)-Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis 2005; A, L.C., Bervian, P.A., (2002) Metodologia Científica. 5.

This decrease in power output typically coincides with the time when utilities need power to meet high air-conditioning loads. A hybrid cooling system uses both air and water to mitigate reduction in power. In this paper, these systems are assessed as to how effectively they can reduce the net power decrease from the plant. In the analysis, a 20-MWe power plant located in northern Nevada was analyzed. The hybrid cooling systems were able to mitigate the decrease in power during hot periods of the day by as much as 2 MWe using only 3% of the water that would normally be used in a fully wet-cooled system. Payback periods for various methods to implement hybrid cooling systems were also determined. Although a water-assist option is generally a retrofit for existing power plants, we suggest that such an option become part of the initial design process (whether it gets implemented at a later date or not). With foresight, such designs are likely to be more tolerant of local wind conditions, making implementation more effective. Further, with the introduction of brazed aluminum air-cooled condensers in the HVAC industry, the performance and cost of using those heat exchangers in geothermal power systems deserves a thorough evaluation, with or without wet assist.","Air-cooled condenser; Air-cooled heat rejection system; Heller system; Hybrid condenser; Power plant","Air-cooled condensers; Brazed aluminum; Geothermal power; Geothermal power production; Heat rejection systems; Heller system; Hybrid cooling; Initial design; Low temperatures; Payback periods; Power out put; Power production; System use; Wind conditions; Geothermal fields; Geothermal power plants; Geothermal prospecting; Investments; Martian surface analysis; Power plants; Thermoelectric equipment; Water analysis; Cooling systems",,,,,"Delman, D., (2011) Equipment Quote, , 17 January Munters, Inc., Dallas, Texas; (2005) Air-cooled Condenser Design, Specification, and Operation Guidelines, , Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Report 1007688; Elkas, M., (2010) Equipment Quote, , 14 December Atomizing Systems, Inc., New Jersey; Heyns, J.A., (2008) Performance Characteristics of Air-cooled Steam Condenser Incorporating a Hybrid (Dry/wet) Dephlegmator, , Master's thesis, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa; Kagel, A., (2008) The State of Geothermal Technology Part II: Surface Technology, , Geothermal Energy Association; Konaglu, M., Çengel, Y.A., Improving the performance of an existing air-cooled binary geothermal power plant: A case study (1999) J.

Through the scientific conceiving we proposed a system of methodological operations (recommendations, prescriptions, guiding), which will ensure the quality and efficiency of the undertaken training process. Purpose of Study: This research was undertaken as a necessity of renewal within the field, with the purpose of showing that in the Physical Education activity only the motric objectives are taken into consideration, while the cognitive and affective ones, although known, are not introduced in the didactic conception or in students' training. Research Methods: Bibliographic study method; Observation method; Enquiry method (conversation, questionnaire, etc.); Pedagogical experiment method; Statistical-Mathematical method; Graphical method. Findings: I have realized a study on a number of 20 professors with the purpose of verifying the statement that during didactic conception, they use only motric objectives, disregarding the cognitive and affective ones. Conclusions: Through scientific conception thought on the basis of cognitive and affective objectives along with the motric ones, we propose a new thinking concept and a new didactic action, which will state explicitly and organized, a system of methodological operations (recommendations, prescriptions, guiding), which will ensure the quality and efficiency of the training process undertaken. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive and affective; Didactic conception; Objectives; Physical education; Professors; Programs; Students",,,,,,"Dragnea, A., (1984) Measuring and Evaluating in Physical Education and Sports, pp. 37-45. , Sport-Tourism Publishing House, Bucharest; Dragnea, A., Bota, A., (1999) Theory of Motric Activities, , Didactic and Pedagogical Publishing House R.A., Bucharest, 163,164,165,166; De Landsheere, V., De Landsheere, G., (1979) Defining Educational Objectives, pp. 37-40. , Editura Didactic and Pedagogical Publishing House, Bucharest 110-120; Epuran, M., Two questions for the authors of the evaluation system of pupils in physical education and sport (2001) Sport Science, 26 (7), pp. 23-29; Epuran, M., (2005) The Methodology of Research for Body Activities.

This view disregards the fact that humans (and possibly other animals) have prospection abilities, which permit anticipating future mental processes and motivational and emotional states. For instance, we can evaluate future outcomes in light of the motivational state we expect to have when the outcome is collected, not (only) when we make a decision. Consequently, we can plan for the future and choose to store food to be consumed when we expect to be hungry, not immediately. Furthermore, similarly to any expected outcome, we can assign a value to our anticipated mental processes and emotions. It has been reported that (in some circumstances) human subjects prefer to receive an unavoidable punishment immediately, probably because they are anticipating the dread associated with the time spent waiting for the punishment. This article offers a formal framework to guide neuroeconomic research on how prospection affects decision-making. The model has two characteristics. First, it uses model-based Bayesian inference to describe anticipation of cognitive and motivational processes. Second, the utility-maximization process considers these anticipations in two ways: to evaluate outcomes (e.g., the pleasure of eating a pie is evaluated differently at the beginning of a dinner, when one is hungry, and at the end of the dinner, when one is satiated), and as outcomes having a value themselves (e.g., the case of dread as a cost of waiting for punishment). By explicitly accounting for the relationship between prospection and value, our model provides a framework to reconcile the utility-maximization approach with psychological phenomena such as planning for the future and dread. © 2011 Pezzulo and Rigoli.","Anticipation; Anticipatory planning; Bayesian; Dread; Forward model; Goal-directed; Model-based; Prospection","anticipation; article; Bayes theorem; cognition; decision making; emotion; human; mathematical model; mental function; motivation; nonhuman; punishment; strategic planning",,,,,"Balleine, B.W., Dickinson, A., Goal-directed instrumental action: contingency and incentive learning and their cortical substrates (1998) Neuropharmacology, 37, pp. 407-419; Barkley, R.A., The executive functions and self-regulation: an evolutionary neuropsychological perspective (2001) Neuropsychol.

Health care research in the Western world is faced with a significant challenge if it is to meet the needs of its populations in the decades ahead. The tools with which we hope to advance our understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of chronic inflammatory diseases must therefore be adequately exploited and further developed to identify treatment and prevention strategies. There is an urgent need to prioritize resources and identify the most efficient scientific and societal initiatives to be adopted within this area. In this context national collaboration within Europe and beyond to establish state-of-the-art practices with an interdisciplinary perspective and promote an efficient exchange of best practices is essential. Such an approach likely represents the most efficient manner in which strategies for amelioration of the increase of chronic inflammatory diseases in the Western world can be achieved. The present report is based on a Forward Look initiative conducted by the European Medical Research Councils under the European Science Foundation. Experts from industry and academia, as well as relevant interest organizations, have been consulted in the process of conducting this initiative and have, based on this work, developed a set of final recommendations that target academic research, science funders, and policy makers. © 2011 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","chronic disease; Europe; foresight; Gene-environment; genetic factors; immunology; inflammation; interdisciplinary; lifestyle; policy","beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; CD3 antibody; corticosteroid; cromoglycate disodium; fructose oligosaccharide; galactose oligosaccharide; interleukin 10; interleukin 13 antibody; interleukin 5 antibody; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; proinsulin; allele; allergy; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; causal attribution; chronic disease; chronic inflammation; consensus development; diet therapy; drug mechanism; drug targeting; epigenetics; Europe; financial management; gene locus; genetic susceptibility; genotype environment interaction; heritability; human; innate immunity; interdisciplinary research; irritable colon; Lactococcus lactis; lifestyle; microbiome; nonhuman; organization; pathogenesis; pharmacogenetics; phenotype; policy; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; translational research; Biomedical Research; Chronic Disease; Europe; Gene-Environment Interaction; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Inflammation",,"cromoglycate disodium, 15826-37-6, 16110-51-3, 93356-79-7, 93356-84-4; fructose oligosaccharide, 88385-81-3; proinsulin, 11062-00-3, 9035-68-1",,,"Xavier, R.J., Rioux, J.D., Genome-wide association studies: A new window into immune-mediated diseases (2008) Nat Rev Immunol, 8, pp. 631-643; Barrett, J.C., Hansoul, S., Nicolae, D.L., Cho, J.H., Duerr, R.H., Rioux, J.D., Genome-wide association defines more than 30 distinct susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease (2008) Nat Genet, 40, pp. 955-962; McGovern, D.P., Gardet, A., Törkvist, L., Goyette, P., Essers, J., Taylor, K.D., Genome-wide association identifies multiple ulcerative colitis susceptibility loci [published erratum in: Nat Genet 2011;43:388] (2010) Nat Genet, 42, pp. 332-337; Kaser, A., Zeissig, S., Blumberg, R.S., Inflammatory bowel disease (2010) Annu Rev Immunol, 28, pp. 573-621; Todd, J.A., Etiology of type 1 diabetes (2010) Immunity, 32, pp. 457-467; Ziegler, A.G., Nepom, G.T., Prediction and pathogenesis in type 1 diabetes (2010) Immunity, 32, pp. 468-478; O'Rahilly, S., Human genetics illuminates the paths to metabolic disease (2009) Nature, 462, pp. 307-314; Bell, J.T., Timpson, N.J., Rayner, N.W., Zeggini, E., Frayling, T.M., Hattersley, A.T., Genome-wide association scan allowing for epistasis in type 2 diabetes (2011) Ann Hum Genet, 75, pp. 10-19; McCarthy, M.I., Genomics, type 2 diabetes, and obesity (2010) N Engl J Med, 363, pp. 2339-2350; Moffatt, M.F., Gut, I.G., Demenais, F., Strachan, D.P., Bouzigon, E., Heath, S., A large-scale, consortium-based genomewide association study of asthma (2010) N Engl J Med, 363, pp. 1211-1221; Willis-Owen, S.A., Cookson, W.O., Moffatt, M.F., Genome-wide association studies in the genetics of asthma (2009) Curr Allergy Asthma Rep, 9, pp. 3-9; Mills, R.E., Walter, K., Stewart, C., Handsaker, R.E., Chen, K., Alkan, C., 1000 Genomes Project.

The technology advances in power electronics and energy storage technologies promises to bring plug-in electric vehicles (both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) into the commercial domain. Many vehicle manufacturers have planned to introduce their vehicles in the market within the next 3 years. However, charging of plug-in electric vehicles can potentially increase peak power demand on power distribution network, and may have impact on various grid assets including thermal loading, voltage, unbalance, losses etc. In order to estimate the potential impacts, we must estimate the additional power demands and its temporal variations due to charging of plug-in electric vehicles. A scenario-based analysis of the impact on the electric power grid has been taken, with Delhi as a case example case. It includes an estimation of the projected growth in number of vehicles, share of battery operated and plug-in hybrid vehicles among the various modes of transport. The impact on the electric power demand will depend significantly on the charging pattern of the vehicles. Both the options of charging from normal (household) ac power outlets, and the dedicated fast charging stations have been considered. It is desirable that charging of vehicles happen in such a way that the effects on the peak demand on the electric power grid is minimized. Since the use of off-peak power for charging of electric vehicles helps in minimizing the impact on the grid, management of vehicle charging will assume significance as level of penetration increases. New concepts like smart charging may gain focus in such context.

Maintaining and protecting biodiversity for the future under changing environmental and socio-political conditions is a major challenge. Scenarios are used as decision-making aids for natural resource management at local to global scales. Scenarios are underutilised by conservationists at a local level, where they can be highly effective for anticipating change. 2. People's values and attitudes are crucial in determining the future, yet they are rarely placed at the centre of scenario exercises. Novel methods have been developed to fully integrate people's worldviews into scenario planning. The ethnographic futures framework focuses on how changes occur through human agency and how they will be felt by society in the future. The three horizons approach considers how different ideas and paradigms become more, or less, dominant in society over time. 3. Natural England (NE), the statutory adviser to the UK Government on the natural environment in England, carried out a scenario planning process using these novel approaches. The scenarios consider a wide range of global and local factors and investigate their impact upon the natural environment in England, to 2060. 4.A set of four contrasting scenarios was produced. Despite their differences, nature was always highly valued in some form; ultimately, the state of the natural environment was determined not by natural forces but by societal choice. 5. Synthesis and applications. Scenario planning allows the development of key visions for the future. These can be used to establish, and influence, the direction of future trends and their impacts on the natural environment, particularly in the context of a shifting basis for conservation policy that seeks to enhance ecological resilience. The scenarios are being used within NE to help local communities shape the future of their natural environment; this process can be utilised by governments or environmental agencies elsewhere. This study demonstrates that across a range of scenarios the future state of the natural environment is very much a matter of societal choice. Decision-making frameworks for environmental conservation must take proper account of ecological knowledge, societal values, foresight and complexity. © 2011 The Authors.

Since 2007, the European Science Foundation (ESF) has been exploring the social science and humanities (SSH) dimension of the exploration and use of outer space. A workshop and two conferences were organised jointly with the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI) and the support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and this activity has resulted in, among other things, one ESF position paper and two books on SSH topics related to outer space published with ESPI. In a recent scoping workshop it was concluded that there was a need to identify a coherent, future-oriented research agenda for SSH research in relation to space, aimed at catering to the unmet, and in many ways still unarticulated, needs of the space research and space policy communities. Research in the exploration and use of space is currently mostly an affair of the natural and engineering sciences, and this may create a blind spot for opportunities, challenges and threats related to the increased possibilities that space offers. Increasingly it is clear that SSH research is important for understanding certain key questions in space research and for informing policy-makers and major space stakeholders. Space offers new opportunities and challenges to humankind and insights from SSH research are needed to identify, understand, evaluate and manage these. Issues range from more or less obvious topics such as Earth monitoring, space security, space situational awareness, space pollution, space-enabled research and services, space industry, space-derived applications, to (perhaps) less obvious topics such as cultural differences between space nations or the impact of space exploration on religion. Space-based assets have become indispensable enablers for a wide spectrum of applications, and the dependency on these assets will grow. Yet, the new possibilities raise many legal, socio-economic, ethical and institutional issues. Bringing the SSH and space communities closer together is especially important for more accurately identifying the possible future(s) of the exploration and use of space; to assess the possible implications of these future(s) for society; and to give input for well-informed choices on these issues. A better insight in future developments with regard to the use of space will help identifying new questions for research and policy.

To robustly quantify impacts of policies on forests and on land use generally requires accounting for economic interactions not only between agricultural and forestry, but also energy and other sectors. At larger scales, these interactions may include linkages via international trade. General equilibrium models are well suited to capture such interactions; however, adequate representation of land use change and forestry in these models remains challenging. We present a dynamic bottom-up representation of forestry within a top-down intertemporal general equilibrium model that is formulated as a mixed complementarity problem (Mathiesen, 1985; Lau et al., 2002). Intertemporally optimal management of forests and optimal harvest ages are determined endogenously within the model, bringing into an intertemporal general equilibrium farmework features hitherto limited to partial equilibrium models (e.g. the Global Timber Model Sedjo and Lyon, 1990; Sohngen et al., 1999) or recursive dynamic general equilibrium models (Pant, H.M. 2010). Planted or naturally regenerating production forests are represented by a set of multiperiod production functions corresponding to a discrete set of harvest ages. Complementarity between negative profits and output allow for the endogenous selection of the optimal age(s) at any time under conditions of perfect foresight. A comparable bottom-up treatment of timber production from and clearance of primary forests is the subject of ongoing research. These dynamic representations of forestry in a general equilibrium framework will allow for more robust assessments of policies such as domestic greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes or Reducing Emissions from Degradation and Deforestation (REDD) Plus in developed and developing countries. Computational limitations on direct bottom-up integration may be prohibited for models with more sectoral or regional detail. However, larger models should be tractable with the aid of decomposition techniques, which allow for tight and theoretically consistent linking of a top-down general equilibrium model with bottom-up partial equilibrium sub-models. This is also the subject of our own-going research An illustrative scenario using a four-region version of our CliMAT-DGE model with bottom-up forestry showed the effects of carbon credits for HWPs in the US, within a wider context of CO 2 emissions pricing by developed countries. We showed not only a significant expansion of forestland and output in the US, but changes in age composition of the forest estate and harvest ages during a six decade transition. Marginal flow-on effects of the US HWP credits were small, but larger effects could be expected for policies affecting a larger share of global forest production, or in regions where forestry is economically more important. Computational considerations limit the number of regions and the level of bottom-up detail achievable through direct bottom-up integration. However, larger models should be solvable with the aid of decomposition techniques, which allow tight and theoretically consistent linking of a top-down model with bottom-up submodels. This is another focus of our own-going research.","Intertemporal general equilibrium; Mixed complementarity; Optimal forest management","Carbon credits; Computational limitations; Decomposition technique; Developed countries; Discrete sets; Dynamic general equilibrium; Dynamic representation; Economic interactions; Food security; Forest estate; Forest land; Forest production; General equilibrium; General equilibrium models; Land use change and forestries; Land-use change dynamics; Mixed complementarity; Mixed complementarity problems; Multi-period; Optimal management; Partial equilibrium; Partial equilibrium model; Primary forest; Production function; Submodels; Timber production; Top down models; Topdown; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Deforestation; Developing countries; Economics; Emission control; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; International trade; Land use; Optimization; Profitability; Research; Timber; Reforestation; Climates; Deforestation; Developing Countries; Economics; Emission; Foreign Trade; Greenhouse Gases; Harvesting; Land Use; Optimization; Profitability",,,,,"Buongiorno, J., Zhu, S., Zhang, D., Turner, J.A., Tomberlin, D., (2003) The Global Forest Products Model: Structure, Estimation and Applications, , Academic Press, San Diego, CA; Ferris, M.C., Munson, T.S., (1998) PATH 4.6 User Manual, , University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI; Golub, A., Hertel, T.W., Sohngen, B., (2009) Economic Analysis of Land Use in Global Climate Change Policy, , Eds, Hertel, T.W., Rose, S. and Tol, R.S.J., Routledge, London, UK; Lau, M.I., Pahlke, A., Rutherford, T.F., Approximating infinite-horizon models in a complementarity format: A primer in dynamic general equilibrium analysis (2002) Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 26, pp. 577-609; Mathiesen, L., Computation of economic equilibria by a sequence of linear complementarity problems (1985) Mathematical Programming Study, 23, pp. 144-162; Narayanan, B.G., Walmsley, T.L., (2008) Global Trade, Assistance, and Production: The GTAP 7 Data Base, , Center for Global Trade Analysis, Purdue University, Lafayette; Pant, H.M., An analytical framework for incorporating land use change and forestry in a dynamic CGE model (2010) AARES 54th Annual Conference, , Paper presented at, Adelaide, Australia, February 10-12; Sedjo, R.A., Lyon, K.S., The long-term adequacy of world timber supply (1990) Resources for the Future, , Washington, DC; Sohngen, B., Golub, A., Hertel, T.W., (2009) Economic Analysis of Land Use in Global Climate Change Policy, , Eds, Hertel, T.W., Rose, S. and Tol, R.S.J., Routledge, London, UK; Sohngen, B., Mendelsohn, R., Sedjo, R., Forest management, conservation, and global timber markets (1999) American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 81, pp. 1-13","Lennox, J.A.; Landcare Research, Lincoln, New Zealand; email: lennoxj@landcareresearch.co.nz",,"CSIRO;Australian Government - Bureau of Meteorology;Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre;Perth Convention Bureau;Curtin University",,"19th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation - Sustaining Our Future: Understanding and Living with Uncertainty, MODSIM2011","12 December 2011 through 16 December 2011","Perth, WA",89164,,9780987214317,,,"English","MODSIM - Int.

When discussing whether a state's policies will lead it to become a successful or unsuccessful energy exporter, the common refrain is whether it would like to be ""Norway or Nigeria."" Hence, Norway appears to be a successful example of how it is possible to develop large- scale oil operations in a way that increases the societal wealth and benefi ts the whole population. Many contemporary studies of the Norwegian oil industry focus on reasons for the absence of ""Dutch disease"" and why Norway lacks the structural characteristics of a ""petrostate."" ? In general, the explanations have focused on Norway's ""po liti cal foresight"" and its ability to build a sophisticated institutional framework.? Th e country's main po liti cal objective has been to further develop the future welfare state through the revenues from the oil business and from the growth of the government pension fund. At the same time, Norway wants to attain the position as a world leader in environmental politics. Due to the tension between climate change targets, biodiversity concerns, and petroleum production, the Norwegian petroleum policy has increasingly been challenged on environmental grounds. A division of interest between the petroleum industrial complex on one hand and environmentalists on the other has emerged to become an important cleavage in the Norwegian po liti cal system. Accordingly, while Norway has succeeded in averting many of the typical traits of major oil- And natural gas- exporting states, a number of perils have also affl icted the state. Chiefl y, a ""petroleum industrial complex"" has emerged in Norway that has signifi - cant infl uence on po liti cal outcomes in the state. Th e complex has succeeded in blocking any challenge to the predominance of fossil fuel production and consumption in Norway. Second, this complex has also succeeded in foiling many environmental policies, especially in the sphere of combating climate change. If Norwegian oil policy appears successful in a historical perspective, it is a result of the fact that it developed within a demo cratic framework. In the mid- 1960s, the Norwegian po liti cal system faced powerful multinational companies that were known for taking the law into their own hands wherever they operated. Multinational companies had a free rein wherever corrupted po liti cal elites secured control over the channels of wealth. In Norway, strong trade unions, community organizations, a growing environmental movement, and active public opinion contributed to give oil operations a diff erent development trajectory. Th e demo cratic forces, however, could hardly have won out if it had not simultaneously been possible to work together with Norwegian companies and utilize Norwegian technological skills to gain the largest possible share of the Norwegian continental shelf. Th e basic idea of the politics and policies was to ensure that the largest possible proportion of oil revenues remained in Norway. Th e most important tool for achieving this goal was the establishment of the Norwegian state oil company, Statoil, in 1972.? As the oil and gas fi elds on the Norwegian continental shelf have matured, Norwegian and foreign petroleum companies increasingly appear to working as a united front. Th e companies themselves and the suppliers, consul tants, stock traders, and public institutions that work hand in hand with the industry have created intricate industrial networks. Th e privatization of Statoil in 2001, followed by the 2007 merger between Statoil and the secondlargest Norwegian oil company, Hydro Oil & Gas, have further strengthened these networks that constitute dominant power constellations in the country. ? In this chapter, we call these constellations ""a petroleum industrial complex."" ? Th e Norwegian petroleum industry constitutes a power elite that seeks and possesses po liti cal infl uence on a variety of the state's policy decisions, especially those in the environmental sphere. From this perspective, the Norwegian petroleum industry no longer represents an unambiguous force for prosperity and wealth but a possible threat to a more sustainable future. Th e remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. Th e next section provides a brief overview of the development of the petroleum industry in Norway. Th en we discuss why Norway has managed to avoid the resource curse and the development trajectories that characterize typical petrostates. Th e second half of the chapter focuses on Norway's environmental challenges as a petroleum- producing country. Finally, we question whether the powerful oil and gas industry in Norway reduces the country's legitimacy as an environmental leader in a world increasingly concerned about man- made climate change.

Actually, the Protection of Designations of Origin is recognized since 1995. Their elaboration encompasses the acetification process to reach the required acetic degree and aging in wood. Phenolic compounds proved to be valid markers to differentiate vinegars according to their origin and elaboration process. Multivariate analysis of phenolic composition data including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Artificial Neural Networks trained by Backpropagation (BPANN) classifies correctly vinegar according to the acetification process (LDA=92.5, BPANN =99.6) and origin (LDA=88, BPANN= 96.5). Good recalling classification rates were also obtained for aging periods. Indeed, phenolic aldehydes as syringaldehyde, vanillin, coniferaldehyde increase their concentration during aging. New trends in Sherry vinegars elaboration intends to shorten the production time. This is achieved by obtaining the acetic degree with submerged culture or by accelerating aging with chips. This communication presents the impact of both strategies on phenolic profile. Nowadays certain innovations to produce high quality vinegars include the type of wood used. Compounds released from it as (+)-taxifolin in the case of cherry wood or (+)-dihydrorobinetin for acacia wood are suitable chemical markers to characterize vinegars aged in these woods. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Authentication; Chemical compounds; Neural networks; Phenols; Wood; Chemical markers; Classification rates; Linear discriminant analysis; Multi variate analysis; Phenolic composition; Phenolic compounds; Phenolic profiles; Submerged cultures; Acetic acid",,,,,"FAO/WHO.

These frames shape all subsequent decision making phases, fundamentally conditioning decision making outcomes. Avenues not considered at this stage are unlikely to be considered in the future. Further, decision making is most creative at these stages: there is a great deal of uncertainty at play but there are fewer constraints and there is less at stake. This paper argues that virtual worlds offer a potent combination of social, sensory and simulational capabilities that can stimulate creativity in decision making; and it also reports the findings of an investigation of the behavioural and cognitive aspects of creative decision making in Second Life®. The findings illustrate that Second Life users are faced with a kind of ""tyranny of freedom"": if anything is possible, where does one start? The answer appears to lie in a kind of ""retrospective foresight"" whereby decision makers draw upon prior experiences and use analogical reasoning to articulate metaphorical systems of thought. © 2011 Lavoisier, Paris.","Creative Decision Making; Framing; Problem Definition; Virtual Worlds","Analogical reasoning; Cognitive aspects; Creative Decision Making; Decision makers; Framing; Prior experience; Problem definition; Second Life; Virtual worlds; Social networking (online); Virtual reality; Decision making",,,,,"Adam, F., (2008) An Investigation into How Managers and Organisations make Decisions and Implications for Decision Support Paris, , l'Université Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris VI, Thèse d'Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches; Adam, F., Pomerol, J.C., Developing Practical Support Tools using Dashboards of Information (2008) Handbook on Decision Support Systems, pp. 151-174. , Burnstein F. and Holsapple C.W., London Springer-Verlag; Ahn, H.J., Lee, H.J., Utilizing knowledge context in virtual collaborative work (2005) Decision Support Systems, 39 (4), pp. 563-582; Amabile, T.M., (1983) The Social Psychology of Creativity, , New York, Springer-Verlag; Amabile, T.M., Conti, R., Assessing the work environment for creativity (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (5), pp. 1154-1184; Angehrn, A.A., Computers That Criticize You: Stimulus-Based Decision Support Systems (1993) Interfaces, 23 (3), pp. 3-16; Angehrn, A.A., Lüthi, H.-J., Intelligent Decision Support Systems: A Visual Interactive Approach (1990) Interfaces, 20 (6), pp. 17-28; Bakshy, E., Simmons, M.P., The Social Dynamics of Economic Activity in a Virtual World (2010) AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, , Washington, DC; Bell, P., Visual Interactive Modelling in Operational Research: Successes and Opportunities (1985) The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 36 (11), pp. 975-982; Belton, V., Elder, M.D., Decision support systems: Learning from visual interactive modelling (1994) Decision Support Systems, 12 (4-5), pp. 355-364; Benbunan-Fich, R., Hiltz, S.R., A comparative content analysis of face-to-face vs. asynchronous group decision making (2003) Decision Support Systems, 34 (4), pp. 457-469; Berthoz, A., Neural basis of decision in perception and in the control of movement (1996) Neurobiology of decision-making, pp. 83-100. , Damasio A.

A four-parameter correlation was found for a class of ionic liquids based on halide. All the descriptors utilized are calculated only from the structures of the molecules, which makes it possible to predict unavailable or unknown ILs, in gas phase and in water (PCM treatment). Satisfactory correlations with the same descriptors were found for both cases but the employment of descriptors calculated in solvent assure a better correlation and a bigger reliability on the foresight. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Ionic liquid; Polarizable continuum model; QSAR; Toxicity; Vibrio fischeri","Aquatic toxicity; Descriptors; Gasphase; Polarizable continuum model; QSAR; Vibrio fischeri; Computational chemistry; Continuum mechanics; Ions; Toxicity; Water treatment; Ionic liquids; Vibrio fischeri",,,,,"Arning, J., Stolte, S., Baschen, A., Stock, F., Pitner, W.R., Welz-Biermann, U., Jastorff, B., Ranke, J., Qualitative and quantitative structure activity relationships for the inhibitory effects of cationic head groups, functionalised side chains and anions of ionic liquids on acetylcholinesterase (2008) Green Chem., 10, pp. 47-58; Austin, R.P., Barton, P., Davis, A.M., Manners, C.N., Stansfield, M.C., The effect of ionic strength on liposome-buffer and 1-octanol-buffer distribution coefficients (1998) J.

This article specifically focuses on Gilles Deleuze's unorthodox approach to epistemology as future-oriented and creative and emphasizes his attention to experimental and experiential becomings. While educational system is traditionally limited to acquiring the factual knowledge of the external world, inner knowledge or Gnosis is not addressed in a habitually secular context. In contrast to the prevailing episteme, this article positions Gnosis within the universal science of life, mathesis. The political impulse of Deleuze's thoughts on mathesis is related to new educational leaders as 'people to come'.",,,,,,,"Bogue, R., Semetsky, I., Reading Signs/Learning from Experience: Deleuze's pedagogy as becomingother (2010) Semiotics Education Experience, , I.

Human judgment, however, is subject to numerous cognitive biases. In this paper, we study the effects of the desirability bias in foresight. We analyze data from six Delphi studies and observe that participants systematically estimate the probability of occurrence for desirable (undesirable) future projections higher (lower) than the probability for projections with neutral desirability. We also demonstrate that in the course of a multi-round Delphi process, this bias decreases but is not necessarily eliminated. Arguably, the quality of decisions based on Delphi results may be adversely affected if experts share a pronounced and common desirability for a future projection. Researchers and decision makers have to be aware of the existence and potential consequences of such a desirability bias in Delphi studies when interpreting their results and taking decisions. We propose a post-hoc procedure to identify and quantify the extent to which the desirability bias affects Delphi results. The results of this post-hoc procedure complement traditional Delphi results; they provide researchers and decision makers with information on when and to which extent results of Delphi-based foresight may be biased. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi; Delphi based decision quality; Desirability bias; Foresight","Cognitive bias; Decision makers; Decision quality; Delphi; DELPHI study; Desirability bias; Foresight; Future projections; Probability of occurrence; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Decision making; decision making; Delphi analysis; probability; spatial cognition",,,,,"Gonzalez, M.V., Environmental uncertainty, futures studies, and strategic planning (1992) Technol.

Herman Kahn, the father of modern scenario planning, underlined the importance of thinking the unthinkable in a significant scenario study. Blessed with high intelligence, an assertive personality and the research capabilities of the RAND Corporation,he could rely on genius forecasting. But how can this foresight be creative as well as simultaneously credible and objective if one does not possess Kahn's genius? In this article, we assess the incorporation of expert knowledge via the Delphi technique into scenario planning as a promising option. We discuss possible combinations and identify the span of design alternatives in the existing body of Delphi-based scenario studies through a systematic research review and provide recommendations on how a Delphi-based scenario study should be designed to ensure quality. We recommend focusing on the integration of the Delphi technique only in one phase of the scenario approach. In this way, the design options can be intentionally adjusted to the particular function. We further offer recommendations on how to accomplish this. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi technique; Foresight; Quality criteria; Scenario development; Scenario planning; Systematic research review","Delphi technique; Foresight; Quality criteria; Scenario development; Scenario Planning; Systematic research; Forecasting; Research; Design; Delphi analysis; future prospect; planning method; qualitative analysis; trend analysis",,,,,"Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: an overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; MacKay, B., McKiernan, P., Creativity and dysfunction in strategic processes: the case of scenario planning (2010) Futures, 42 (4), pp. 271-281; Gupta, U.G., Clarke, R.E., Theory and applications of the Delphi technique: a bibliography (1975-1994) (1996) Technol.

Our benchmark model without any frictions and taxes accounts for 86% of the observed change in the growth rate of GDP per-working age person and once we extend the model with taxes and capital adjustment costs it accounts for 60% of the observed reduction in hours worked per-working age person and 35% of the change in the growth of capital-output ratio. Also, we identify that the Turkish economy experienced a depression from 1976 to 1984 and the extended model performs remarkably well to account for the depression period.

Monumental earthworks in Ohio (USA) dating to 2000 BP-the Hopewell geometric enclosures-are examined by these means. The matrix of landscape viewshed and celestial dome shape human production of local cosmogonies, becoming encoded across the terrain by indexical sightlines and functional and ritual architectures. The resultant array of calendrical alignments defines a suite of horizon foresights on the surrounding skyline, whose premised archaeological presence/absence provides a hypothetico-deductive test in a field of study where such evidence is often lacking. While accurate calendrical sightlines were likely used for subsistence and other scheduling, a spectrum of sensory stimuli would accompany observations and associated ritual performances. Light, color, and temperature-the compelling sensory phenomena experienced during the sunrises and sunsets indexed at these earthworks-augment the in situ observations at the sightlines: for the prehistoric Hopewell calendrical specialists, for a present-day field researcher, or for the interested public at future interpretive events. © Berg 2011.","Archaeoastronomy; Hypothesis testing; Ohio hopewell culture; Phenomenology; Sensory archaeology",,,,,,"Almazan, T.T., Nash, S.E., Zych, L., The field museum hopewell catalogue project: Getting the word out (2004) Hopewell Archeology: The Newsletter of Hopewell Archeology In the Ohio River Valley, 6 (1), pp. 2-7; Atwater, C., Descriptions of the antiquities discovered in the state of ohio and other western states (1820) American Antiquarian Society, Archaeologia Americana, Transactions and Collections, 1, pp. 105-267; Aveni, A.F., Astronomical tables intended for use in astroarchaeological studies (1972) American Antiquity, 37 (4), pp. 531-540; Aveni, A.F., Tropical archeoastronomy (1981) Science, 213 (4504), pp. 161-171; Aveni, A.F., (1997) Stairways to The Stars: Skywatching In Three Ancient Cultures, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; Blain, J., Wallis, R.J., Sacred sites, contested rites/rights (2004) Journal of Material Culture, 9 (3), pp. 237-261; Bradley, R., (1998) The Significance of Monuments, , London: Routledge; Braun, D.P., Plog, S., Evolution of 'tribal' social networks: Theory and prehistoric north american evidence (1982) American Antiquity, 47 (3), pp. 504-525; Broda, J., Zenith observations and the conception of geographical latitude in ancient mesoamerica: A historical interdisciplinary approach (2004) Paper Presented At the 7th Oxford International Conference On Archaeoastronomy, , Flagstaff, Arizona; Brose, D.S., (1976) An Historical and Archaeological Investigation of the Hopeton Earthworks, , Submitted to the National Park Service, contract PX-6115-6-0141, Midwest Archaeological Center, Lincoln, Nebraska; Brose, D.S., Greber, N.B., (1979) Hopewell Archaeology: The Chillicothe Conference, , eds, Kent, OH: Kent State University Press; Brown, C.H., Where do cardinal direction terms come from?

To solve the environment problems came from greenhouse effect, scientists around the world carried out many research projects on the globle carbon cycle. Compared with other continents such as Europe and America, East Asia may have more ecological importance in the study of global carbon cycle. In 2007, an international joint research project (the A3 Foresight Program), aiming to investigate the carbon sources and sinks in East Asia, was launched, which is founded by the national foundations of China, Japan and South Korea. To reflect the main outcomes in the past three years from this program, the journal Science China Life Science published a special issue ""Carbon Budget in East Asian Ecosystem"" in 2010 (Vol. 53, No. 7, 2010). This issue contains 14 contributions categorized into 4 parts, including carbon stocks and their regional variations, changes in carbon sources and sinks for different forest ecosystems, carbon stocks and changes in grassland and farmland ecosystems, and new approaches to carbon cycle research. The main points and significations of these articles are comprehensively commentated.","Carbon cycle; Carbon stock; East Asian; Ecosystem",,,,,,"Reiners, W.A., A summary of the world carbon cycle and recommendations for critical research/woodwell G M, pecan E V (1973) Carbon and the Biosphere, (30), pp. 368-382. , AEC Symposium Series.

We demonstrate how the real-time (computer-based) method increases the efficiency of the process, accommodates expert availability, and reduces drop-out-rates. Modifications in the Delphi procedure (e.g. change of iteration principle) not only increase efficiency but also change the nature and process of the survey technique itself. By identifying and analysing three individual effects (initial condition effect, feedback effect, and iteration effect) we examine whether the modifications in the survey process cause deviations to the survey results. Empirical data obtained from both conventional as well as real-time Delphi studies is analysed based on multiple statistical analyses. The research findings indicate that significant differences between the two Delphi survey formats do not exist and final survey results are not affected by changes in the survey procedure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Conventional Delphi; Foresight; Methodological comparison; Real-time Delphi","Conventional Delphi; Delphi method; DELPHI study; Delphi technique; Empirical data; Feedback effects; Foresight; Initial conditions; Methodological comparison; Real-time Delphi; Innovation; Technological forecasting; Surveys; comparative study; Delphi analysis; efficiency measurement; innovation; model validation; planning method; real time; research work; statistical analysis",,,,,"Turoff, M., The design of a policy Delphi (1970) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 2, pp. 149-171; Rowe, G., Wright, G., The Delphi technique as a forecasting tool: issues and analysis (1999) International Journal of Forecasting, 15, pp. 353-375; von der Gracht, H.A., Vennemann, R., Darkow, I.-L., Corporate Foresight and Innovation Management: A Portfolio-Approach in Evaluating Organizational Development (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 380-393; Landeta, J., Current validity of the Delphi method in social sciences (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73, pp. 467-482; Gordon, T., Pease, A., RT Delphi: An efficient, ""round-less"" almost real time Delphi method (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73, pp. 321-333; Webler, T., Levine, D., Rakel, H., Renn, O., A novel approach to reducing uncertainty: The group Delphi (1991) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 39, pp. 253-263; Bardecki, M.J., Participants' response to the Delphi method: An attitudinal perspective (1984) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 25, pp. 281-292; Rowe, G., Wright, G., The impact of task characteristics on the performance of structured group forecasting techniques (1996) International Journal of Forecasting, 12, pp. 73-89; Rowe, G., Wright, G., Bolger, F., Delphi: A Reevaluation of Research and Theory (1991) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 39, pp. 235-251; Rowe, G., Wright, G., McColl, A., Judgment change during Delphi-like procedures: The role of majority influence, expertise, and confidence (2005) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 72, pp. 377-399; Blind, K., Cuhls, K., Grupp, H., Personal attitudes in the assessment of the future of science and technology: A factor analysis approach (2001) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 68, pp. 131-149; Cuhls, K., von Oertzen, J., Kimpeler, S., Zuknftige Informationstechnologie fr den Gesundheitsbereich (2007) Schriftenreihe Informations- und Medientechnologien in Baden Wrttemberg, Stuttgart, , M.S.

By the term standardisation, we broadly mean the process of developing and implementing technical standards within a standardisation body. Underlining the explorative nature of this paper, we describe the process of identifying future fields of standardisation.To provide a systematic forecasting view on complex science and technology fields, a combination of quantitative indicator-based analyses and qualitative in-depth Delphi surveys is choosen. Firstly, statistical analyses of suitable indicators are used to identify dynamic developments in such fields. Secondly, to identify detailed challenges for future standardisation, qualitative Delphi surveys are conducted. To collect and evaluate relevant issues the respective expert communities were included. They were identified by using information derived from the science and technology databases used.The paper concludes with the assessment of the chosen approach and give practical insights for its feasibility based on a review of the existing literature on the Delphi methodology. In addition, an outlook for further improvements and other possible fields of application is given. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi; Science and technology indicators; Standardisation foresight","Complex science; Delphi; Delphi methodology; Dynamic development; Science and Technology; Science and technology indicators; Technical standards; Surveys; Technological forecasting; Technology; Standardization; Delphi analysis; feasibility study; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; science and technology; standardization",,,,,"Martin, B.R., Foresight in science and technology (1995) Technol.

An efficient insurance system must guarantee that loss adjustment is performed fairly and transparently, so that the continual review and modification of adjustment rules becomes especially important. The present study develops and applies a methodology based on the subjective information compiled by experts to evaluate the modification of the Specific Loss Adjustment Rule for Fruit Crops under real market conditions.The results show that the method employed comes forward as a valid option to provide reliable information, as well as other economic and social advantages, in the absence of alternative statistical sources. The validity of the study has been proved by its utility, as the results were extremely useful for drawing up a new Official Adjustment Rule. This application opens up an interesting field of development for this technique, which will enable the proposed methodology to be applied to similar studies in the context of agricultural insurance loss adjustment. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Agricultural insurance; Delphi; Foresight study; Loss adjustment; Subjective information","Adjustment rules; Damage assessments; Delphi; Delphi technique; Foresight study; Fruit crops; Quantitative information; Real markets; Statistical sources; Subjective information; Crops; Fruits; Insurance; Rating; Damage detection; agricultural economics; agricultural policy; crop production; Delphi analysis; efficiency measurement; fruit production; insurance system; model test; model validation; quantitative analysis; reliability analysis; Spain",,,,,"Landeta, J., Matey, J., Ruz, V., Galter, J., Results of a Delphi survey in drawing up the input-output tables for Catalonia (2008) Technol.

Having overcome many physical barriers to freedom of movement, humanity now faces two major, related challenges: dwindling reserves of fossil fuels, and anthropogenic climate change. In these circumstances, rail transport has significant potential advantages over the more energy-intensive modes of road and air.Railways dominated 19th century land transport, peaking in importance in the early 1900s. Market share then declined in the face of competition from road transport and aviation, although rail retained significant passenger and freight transport roles. Major improvements in railway operating efficiency were introduced later in the 20th century, including: the switch from steam to diesel and electric traction; containerisation and focus on long-haul, unit-train freight operations; and the development of high-speed passenger rail services in Japan and Europe, enabling rail to compete successfully with air travel over distances of up to 800. km.The UK Government's Foresight Programme commissioned a report entitled Intelligent Infrastructure Futures, for which four scenarios were developed of how society might be in 2055. These scenarios are: 'Perpetual Motion', 'Urban Colonies', 'Tribal Trading' and 'Good Intentions', each having its own implications for the future of transport. This paper considers the implications of each scenario, and of the underlying/overriding issues of peak oil and climate change, for the possible role and significance of rail transport in meeting our transport needs in the mid-21st century and beyond. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Future; Oil; Rail; Scenario","climate change; fossil fuel; freight transport; movement; railway transport; road transport",,,,,"Chester, M.V., Horvath, A., (2009), http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/4/2/024008/, Environmental Assessment of Passenger Transportation should Include Infrastructure and Supply Chains.

The leaders (macrocells) foresight the response of followers (femtocells), and maximize their individual utility in a non-cooperative manner. After the leaders apply their strategies, the followers also maximize their own utility in a noncooperative manner. Then the Backward Induction method is applied to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical game with dualutility outperforms the non-cooperative approach and the hierarchical game with single-utility in terms of average outage probability and average throughput. © 2011 IEEE.","Interference mitigation; OFDMA femtocell; Power allocation; Stackelberg game","Average throughput; Backward induction; Femtocell; Interference mitigation; Leader-follower approach; Macro cells; Non-cooperative; OFDMA femtocell; Outage probability; Power allocations; Simulation result; Stackelberg; Stackelberg equilibrium; Stackelberg game; Mobile computing; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Frequency division multiple access",,,,,"Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Gatherer, A., Femtocell networks: A survey (2008) IEEE Communications Magazine, 46 (9), pp. 59-67. , September; Lopez-Perez, D., Valcarce, A., De La Roche, G., OFDMA femtocells: A roadmap on interference avoidance (2009) IEEE Communications Magazine, 47, pp. 41-48. , September; Boudreau, G., Panicke, J., Guo, N., Interference coordination and cancellation for 4G networks (2009) IEEE Communications Magazine, 47, pp. 74-81. , April; Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Gatherer, A., Power control in two-tier femtocell networks (2009) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 8, pp. 4316-4328. , Aug; Hong, E.J., Yun, S.Y., Cho, D.H., Decentralized power control scheme in femtocell networks: A game theoretic approach (2009) IEEE PIMRC 2009, pp. 415-419. , Sept; Bennis, M., Debbah, M., On spectrum sharing with underlaid femtocell networks (2010) IEEE PIMRC 2010, Indoor Outdoor Femto Cells (IOFC) Workshop, pp. 185-190. , September; Guruacharya, S., Niyato, D., Hossain, E., Kim, D.I., Hierarchical competition in femtocell-based cellular networks (2010) IEEE GLOBECOM2010, pp. 1-5. , December; Fudenberg, D., Tirole, J., (1991) Game Theory, , Cambridge: The MIT Press; Yu, W., Ginis, G., Cioffi, J.M., Distributed multiuser power control for digital subscriber lines (2002) IEEE J. on Selected Areas in Comm., 20 (5), pp. 1105-1115. , June; He, G., Betz, S., Debbah, M., Game-theoretic deployment design of small-cell OFDM networks (2009) 3rd ICST/ACM International Workshop on Game Theory in Communication Networks, , October; (2010) Further Advancements for E-UTRA Physical Layer Aspects(Release 9), , 3GPP, Technical Report 36.814v 9.0.0, March","Huang, Z.; School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; email: zhengleihuang@gmail.com",,"Wuhan University;Huazhong University of Science and Technology;Communication University of China;Jiangsu University;Engineering Information Institute",,"7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, WiCOM 2011","23 September 2011 through 25 September 2011","Wuhan",87058,,9781424462520,,,"English","Int.

DXA is still referred as, gold standard for BMD assessment. Authenticity of BMD, measured by DXA at anatomic sites such as proximal and spine has incorporated WHO initiation in proposing a tool for diagnosing osteoporosis. In India, osteoporosis is widely evident in post-menopausal women and elder members of both the genders. A direct proportionality exists between degree of mortality and morbidity with hip and spine pathology. Foresight in predicting the risk of fracture is an important physician's goal. Though DXA has been considered as the gold standard for BMD measurement (g/cm2), the main loophole is the fact that it won't take in to consideration, bone geometry and its micro architecture. The main objective of the present study was to check roughness potential and trabecular bone wavier-ness of the proximal femur that has been sensed by digital x-ray images in post-menopausal osteoporosis evaluation, when DXA has been used as a gold reference for BMD measurement. DXA BMD of the right proximal femur of 26 (n=26, mean ± SD, age = 53.27 ± 14.6 years) south Indian women aged above 25 years was measured. Protocol devised by WHO was adopted in all women. Digital radiograph of right proximal femur was acquired, confirming to medical technicalities. Different methods were used to carry out texture analysis. Relation of BMD with BMI was justified by the results obtained in this study. The present study deciphered the fact that 23% and 27% were affected by osteoporosis and osteopenia respectively. Osteoporotic women exhibited the higher degree of mean roughness, RMS of roughness, mean wavier value and RMS of wavier of neck region compared to normal women as 17%, 15%, 16% and 16% respectively. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Computer aided diagnosis (CAD); DXA; Femur bone; Hip radiograph; Osteoporosis; Texture analysis","DXA; Femur bone; Hip radiograph; Osteoporosis; Texture analysis; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); DXA; Hip radiographs; Osteoporosis; Texture analysis; Bone; Computer aided diagnosis; Diseases; Gold; Image processing; Imaging systems; Information technology; Pathology; Pattern recognition; Radiography; Textures; X ray analysis; X ray apparatus; Computer aided design; Computer aided analysis; Diseases",,,,,"http://www.iofbonehealth.org/facts-and-statistics.html, accessed on April 23, 2011; Mahadevan, V., Sapthagirivasan, V., Information Processing of Medical Images for the Detection of Osteoporosis in Hip Region of Interest (2010) Intl.

These algorithms start from the alpha-EM algorithm which includes the traditional log-EM as its proper subset. Since existing or traditional HMMs are the outcome of the log-EM, it had been expected that the alpha-HMM would exist. In this paper, it is shown that this foresight is true by using methods of the iteration index shift and likelihood ratio expansion. In each iteration, new update equations utilize one-step past terms which are computed and stored during the previous maximization step. Therefore, iteration speedup directly appears as that of CPU time. Since the new method is theoretically based on the alpha-EM, all of its properties are inherited. There are eight types of alpha-HMMs derived. They are discrete, continuous, semi-continuous and discrete-continuous alpha-HMMs, and both for single and multiple sequences. Using the properties of the alpha-EM algorithm, the speedup property is theoretically analyzed. Experimental results including real world data are given. © 2011 IEEE.",,"CPU time; Fast estimation; Index shift; Likelihood ratios; Markov model; Multiple sequences; Real world data; Semi-continuous; Algorithms; Neural networks; Hidden Markov models",,,,,"Baum, L.E., Petrie, T., Soules, G., Weiss, N., A maximization technique occurring in the statistical analysis of probabilistic functions of Markov chains (1970) The Annals of Math.

The participants who took part in this survey were from different organizations in Iran, and they also participated in a workshop for practicing the related methods of Technology Foresight (TF). Statistical methods implemented for analyzing the results of the questionnaires are histogram chart, Kruskal- Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test for multi-comparison between organizations. The highlighted points of the analysis are lack of specialist, moderate attention on TF programmes and inconsistency between organization goals and government perspective. However, they have prepared plans and policies regarding foresight activities for shaping their organizations to meet future needs of technology competitiveness and development.

In terms of the needs of times, this study regarding the strategy for the formation of the innovation clusters is anticipated to be a good reference for the R&D organizations and technology cluster participants in coming years. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Cluster policy; Qualitative study; Scenario Planning; Strategy formulations; Technology cluster; Theoretical study; Industrial management; Technology",,,,,"(1999) Boosting Innovation: The Cluster Approach, , OECD; (2001) Innovative Clusters: Driver's of National Innovation Systems, , OECD; Porter, M.E., (2001) From Economic Development Theory to Action: The Process of Cluster Upgrading; Porter, M.E., Clusters and the new economic of competition (1998) Harvard Business Review, pp. 77-90. , November-December; Jonston, R., (2006) Scenario Planning, Strategic Foresight in Modern Management, , Foresight Course, PREST, University of Manchester, 2006; Cook, Regional innovation systems: International and organizational dimension (1997) Research Policy, 25; (1999) Clustering as a Tool for Regional Economic Competitiveness, , SRI International; (2010) Gyeonggi Province and Pangyotechnovalley Presentation Material, , GSTEP; http://www.ggtv.or.kr; http://www.pangyotechnovalley.org","Lee, W.I.; Strategy and Planning Division, Gyeonggi Institute of Science and Technology Promotion (GSTEP), 906-5, Iui-dong, Youngtong-Gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea",,"Portland State University;PSU Office of Information Technologies;IKON Office Solutions",,"Portland International Center for Management of Engineering and Technology - Technology Management in the Energy-Smart World, PICMET'11","31 July 2011 through 4 August 2011","Portland, OR",86745,,1890843245; 9781890843243,,,"English","PICMET: Portland Int.

Tens of thousands of us spend considerable amounts of time and money improving their situation. But few of us have been as effective in drawing attention to these issues and keeping them on the agenda of political elites and institutions around the world as celebrities such as Angelina Jolie have been. Star power defies conventional accounts of democratic leadership. It epitomizes the notion of leadership dispersal, although not one that is the product of institutional design let alone constitutional foresight. It rests upon personal rather than institutional moral capital, that capital is derived from fame, dramaturgy, and personality marketing in the non-political sphere, rather than by democratic election, representation, and accountability. © Oxford University Press, 2014.","Activism; Celebrities; Celebrity politics; Democracy; Democratic politics; Elections; Leadership; Mobilization",,,,,,"Garrett Denies Selling Out Beliefs (2007) Daily Telegraph, , 1 April, available at: <>; Garrett Pathetic Over Pulp Mill: Howard (2007) Sydney Morning Herald, , 9 October, available at: <>; Bang, H., (2003) Governance as Social and Political Communication, , Manchester:Manchester University Press; Bevir, M., Rhodes, R.A.W., Prime Ministers, Presidentialization and Westminster Smokescreens (2006) Political Studies, 54 (4), pp. 671-690; Boorstin, D.J., (1961) The Image, or, What Happened to the American Dream, , London:Weidenfeld and Nicholson; Braudy, L., (1986) The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and its History, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Cooper, A.F., (2008) Celebrity Diplomacy, , Boulder: Paradigm Publishers; Cowen, T., (2000) What Price Fame, , Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press; Drake, P., Higgins, M., ""I'm a Celebrity, Get Me into Politics"": The Political Celebrity and the Celebrity Politician (2006) Framing Celebrity, pp. 87-100. , S.

This approach identifies future standardisation aspects in dynamic, innovative fields of technology by combining a computerised quantitative analysis of science and technology indicators (e.g., patent applications, scientific publications, etc.)and Delphi-based surveys.We first describe the function and economic effects of standards in the innovative process.Then, we introduce an indicator module to identify future fields of standardisation and combine this qualitative analysis with an online Delphi survey.To illustrate the general methodological approach, we exemplarily display major results on nanotechnology.We conclude by assessing the application of our standard foresight approach and its extensibility towards computer-aided information retrieval. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Delphi; Nanotechnology; Science and technology indicators; Standardisation foresight",,,,,,"Blind, K., (2004) The Economics of Standards - Theory, Evidence, Policy, , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, ISBN 1-84376-793-7; Blind, K., Regulatory foresight: Methodologies and selected applications (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 496-516. , DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2008.02.004, PII S0040162508000346; Blind, K., Cuhls, K., Grupp, H., Current foresight activities in central Europe (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 60 (1), pp. 15-35; Blind, K., Cuhls, K., Grupp, H., Personal attitudes in the assessment of the future of science and technology: A factor analysis approach (2001) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 68 (2), pp. 131-149. , DOI 10.1016/S0040-1625(00)00083-4, PII S0040162500000834; Blind, K., Gauch, S., Research and standardisation in nanotechnology: Evidence from Germany (2009) Journal of Technology Transfer, 34 (3), pp. 320-342; Calero, C., Buter, R., Valdes, C.C., Noyons, E., How to identify research groups using publication analysis: An example in the field of nanotechnology (2006) Scientometrics, 66 (2), pp. 365-376. , DOI 10.1007/s11192-006-0026-z; Compano, R., Hullmann, A., Forecasting the development of nanotechnology with the help of science and technology indicators (2002) Nanotechnology, 13 (3), pp. 243-247. , DOI 10.1088/0957-4484/13/3/301, PII S0957448402314211; David, P., Some new standards for the economics of standardization in the information age (1987) Economic Policy and Technological Performance, , in Dasgupta, P. and Stoneman, P.

After constructing the timeline with the experimenter, each child was asked to discuss a number of different events: an event that happened yesterday, an event that happened earlier today, an event that would happen later today, and an event that would happen tomorrow. As judged by their parents, children's accounts were highly accurate. After controlling for age and language scores, there was a strong relation between amount of information reported about past and future events. Overall, 5-year-olds reported more total information than 3-year-olds; however, reports by 3-year-olds included a similar proportion of first-person reference as did reports by 5-year-olds. No age difference appeared in proportion of future-oriented talk. We conclude that the present task provides a promising method of exploring the emergence of mental time travel during early childhood. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Autobiographical memory; Episodic foresight; Episodic memory; Preschool development; Temporal order",,,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future (2007) Neurospychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Atance, C.M., Jackson, L.K., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102, pp. 379-391; Atance, C., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361; Atance, C., O'Neill, K.K., Preschoolers' talk about future situations (2005) First Language, 25, pp. 6-18; Bauer, P.J., (2007) Remembering the times of our lives: Memory in infancy and beyond, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ; Busby, J., Suddendorf, T., Recalling yesterday and predicting tomorrow (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 362-372; Butler, S., Gross, J., Hayne, H., The effect of drawing on memory performance in young children (1995) Developmental Psychology, 31, pp. 597-608; Cleveland, E.S., Reese, E., Children remember early childhood: Long-term recall across the offset of childhood amnesia (2008) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 22, pp. 127-142; Colombo, M., Hayne, H., Episodic memory: Comparative and developmental issues (2010) Oxford handbook of developmental behavioral neuroscience, pp. 617-636. , Oxford University Press, Oxford, M.S.

Moreover, the countries of the southern and eastern rims of the Mediterranean are today seeing profound social and political upheavals that are likely also to affect the northern rim, making their futures uncertain, to say the least. In such a context, it becomes essential to have solid foresight analyses of the region. Long before the Arab revolutions of spring 2011 began, the European Commission had launched a wide-ranging foresight exercise on the Mediterranean region up to the year 2030, entitled EuroMed-2030. This was driven by a group of 20 international experts and submitted its findings in December 2010. Domenico Rossetti di Valdalbero, Perla Srour- Gandon and Spela Majcen present the main lessons to be gleaned from the exercise here. After reviewing the major trends in the region (in demographic, economic, cultural, scientific, agricultural and energy terms), our authors stress the principal tensions and uncertainties that are likely to influence the future of the Mediterranean zone (socioeconomic inequalities, democratic and reforming aspirations, tensions between hostile states, divergent views of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation etc.). From this starting point, they present the four transitional scenarios identified by EuroMed-2030 - ""Managing Conflict"", ""Engaging in Win-Win Projects"", ""Deeper Economic Integration"" and ""Towards a EuroMed Community"" - as well as various flagship initiatives and more concrete recommendations that may well accompany them.",,,,,,,"Euromed-2030: Long term challenges for the mediterranean area (2011) Report of an Expert Group et EuroMcd-2010: Collection of Individual Contributions of the Experts, 144p. , COMMISSION EUROPÉENNE, Luxembourg : Office des publications de l' Union européenne, respectivement, et 320 p; Direction Générale de la Recherche et de l'innovation.

These are generally subsumed under the terms 'futures research', 'futures studies' and 'foresight'. Complexity science applications are outlined for each of the schools, and these provide evolving theories for futures thinking. (1) Environmental and geosciences treat the Earth and its various components as typical out-of-equilibrium systems with dissipative processes. (2) Infrastructure and socio-technological systems emerge through the diffusion of investment capital, with the endogenous transformation of the urban system. (3) Social, political and economic sciences are being reshaped away from the notion of economic equilibrium, and describe social emergence by means of agent-based models. (4) Human life, mind and information sciences are evolving with the development of complexity models in neuroscience, immune systems, epidemic modelling, social media technologies and artificial intelligence.

Standing at the heart of their businesses, procurement managers need to limit the negative impact of the crisis. Restructuring and cost killing are usually the first responses. However, some buyers are pioneering a new kind of collaborative management that, instead of increasing the pressure on suppliers and reducing risk-taking to a minimum, advocates taking new initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to present a new, ""collaborative buyer"" approach to the management of the procurement function. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research uses a constructivist methodology based on interviews of 12 buying experts. It develops scenarios and identifies the features of collaborative procurement. In order to map the future of the procurement function, this research looks at the expectations and forecasts of the players involved. The aim is a comprehensive, long, rational, ownership approach that is action oriented. Findings: The paper offers an overview of new, foresight-based procurement practices, based on the subtle but precise perception of the faint signs of coming change by people immersed in the procurement sector. The procurement professionals agreed to co-construct a new buyer profile resulting from changes to the old buyer profile and the convergence of other occupations with new skills and expertise. Originality/value: The aim is to carefully co-construct a picture of the future of the procurement function. The paper presents new forms of internal and external collaboration, the roles and specific skills of this type of ""buyer of the future,"" and how the globalised economy is becoming an increasingly community based, collaborative virtual environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Economic conditions; Economic crisis; Foresight; France; Procurement; Procurement function; Supply chain management",,,,,,"Albrecht, C., Dean, D., Hansen, J., Marketplace and technology standards for B2B e-commerce: Progress, challenges, and the state of the art (2005) Information & Management, 42 (6), pp. 813-828; Allal-Chérif, O., An economic model for electronic marketplaces (2007), PhD thesis, University of Grenoble 2; Allal-Chérif, O., Favier, M., Le modèle économique des places de marché électroniques: Du transactionnel au collaboratif (2008) Revue Française De Gestion, 181 (2), pp. 161-173; Araujo, L., Dubois, A., Gadde, L.E., Managing interfaces with suppliers (1999) Industrial Marketing Management, 28 (5), pp. 497-506; Bakos, J.Y., Reducing buyer search costs: Implications for electronic marketplaces (1997) Management Science, 43 (12), pp. 1676-1692; Ballaz, B., Le management des achats et de la chaîne intégrée clients-fournisseurs: Le rôle clé du système d'information (2002) Le Management Des Achats, pp. 87-109. , Castagnos, J.C., Retour, D.

The case study looks at the industrial city of Steyr which is located in a highly dynamic region in Upper Austria and has to compete with other regional industrial centres and on the global market with internationally acting companies in the automotive sector. For finding local strategies to cope with globally induced pressures and changes several foresight techniques and transdisciplinary approaches have been applied such as interviews, photo elicitation, workshops and scenario building. The transdisciplinary case study is reflected by exploring three major research questions: first, how does transdisciplinarity work in practice, second, what are the benefits and limitations of transdisciplinary research in regional foresight processes and third, how can transdisciplinary research contribute to initiating a long-term process for building sustainable networks and structures in the region. Some answers can be given from the empirical example of Steyr. The case study shows that particularly in regions with a long industrial history and tradition and where existing paradigms cannot easily be overcome, a transdisciplinary procedure provides clear advantages over sole expert solutions. Transdisciplinarity can be the key to get through to the local actors, to develop perfectly fitting strategies for the region and to initiate joint learning and in an ideal situation a long-term change process. New ideas, structures and networks are established which are essential for improving the long-term development of a region. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"automobile industry; future prospect; industrial development; industrial district; regional development; Austria; Steyr; Upper Austria",,,,,"Ataöv, A., Constructing co-generative search processes: re-thinking urban planning/making urban plans actionable (2008) European Planning Studies, 16 (6), pp. 829-851; Balsiger, P.W., Supradisciplinary research practices: history, objectives and rationale (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 407-421; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborgb, K.-H., Ekvallc, T., Finnvedena, G., Scenario types and techniques: towards a user's guide (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 723-739; Burger, P., Zierhofer, W., Doing transdisciplinarity - Analyse und Reflexion einer anspruchsvollen Wissenschaftspraxis (2007) Gaia, 16 (1), pp. 27-28; Carew, A.L., Wickson, F., The TD wheel: a heuristic to shape, support and evaluate transdisciplinary research (2010) Futures; Darnhofer, I., Loibl, M.C., (2007) Experiences from Transdisciplinary Workshops: Co-learning about the Effects of Global Change on Farming and Rural Areas, , XXIInd ESRS Congress, Wageningen; Folke, C., Carpenter, S., Elmqvist, T., Gunderson, L., Holling, C.S., Walker, B., Bengtsson, J., Svedin, U., http://www.icsu.org/Gestion/img/ICSU_DOC_DOWNLOAD/64_DD_FILE_Vol3.pdf, Resilience and Sustainable Development.

When the investors' protection is perfect, the model reduces to the standard one sector growth model proposed by Reichlin (JET 40:89-102, 1986), while the model reduces to the one studied by Matsuyama (Econometrica 72:853-884, 2004) when the agents' labor supply is exogenous. Our goal is to highlight that the local analysis of the perfect foresight equilibrium may lead to misleading conclusions because the local analysis neglects the occurrence of different global bifurcation scenarios. In particular, the existence of a heteroclinic connection or the occurrence of a homoclinic bifurcation may be associated with global indeterminacy even when all steady states are locally determinate. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Credit market imperfection; Elastic labor supply; Endogenous fluctuations; Homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations",,,,,,"Agliari, A., Vachadze, G., (2010) Endogenous Labor Supply, Borrowing Constraint, and Credit Cycles, , http://ideas.repec.org/p/ctc/serie2/dises1059.html, Working Paper no. 59, DISES Universitàé1 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Piacenza (Italy; Bai-Lin, H., (1989) Elementary Symbolic Dynamics and Chaos in Dissipative Systems, , Singapore: World Scientific; Benhabib, J., Eusepi, S., The design of monetary and Fiscal policy: A global perspective (2005) Journal of Economic Theory, 123, pp. 40-73; Benhabib, J., Schmitt-Grohé, S., Uribe, M., The Perils of Taylor rules (2001) Journal of Economic Theory, 96, pp. 40-69; Cazzavillan, G., Lloyd-Braga, T., Pintus, P.A., Multiple steady states and endogenous fluctuations with increasing returns to scale in production (1998) Journal of Economic Theory, 80, pp. 60-107; Cazzavillan, G., Indeterminacy and endogenous fluctuations with arbitrarily small externalities (2001) Journal of Economic Theory, 101, pp. 133-157; Cazzavillan, G., Pintus, P., Robustness of multiple equilibria in OLG economies (2004) Review of Economic Dynamics, 7, pp. 456-475; Chiappori, P.A., Guesnerie, R., Sunspot equilibria in sequential markets model (1991) Handbook of Mathematical Economics, 4, pp. 1683-1762. , W.

Childhood obesity results in clinical conditions such as metabolic syndrome, early atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, hyper tension, fatty liver and type 2 diabetes. Central obesity is directly linked to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Ethnicity, intrauterine environment, low birth weight, excess diet and poor physical activity are the etiopathogenetic factors which work synergistically. With the foresight that metabolic syndrome tracks into adulthood, it should be recognized and intervened early for the prevention of diabetes and coronary heart disease. The treatment of obesity during childhood and adolescent period is mainly non pharmacological and aims at promoting lifestyle modification. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a strong clinical correlate of metabolic syndrome relevant to adolescent girls. Diagnostic criteria and treatment for adolescent PCOS are not clearly defined yet. Lifestyle modification forms the basis of preventive and therapeutic strategy of the epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome.","Metabolic syndrome; Polycystic ovarian disease",,,,,,"Duncan, G.E., Li, S.M., Zhou, X.-H., Prevalence and trends of a metabolic syndrome phenotype among U.S. adolescents, 1999-2000 (2004) Diabetes Care, 27 (10), pp. 2438-2443. , DOI 10.2337/diacare.27.10.2438; Goodman, E., Daniels, S.R., Meigs, J.B., Dolan, L.M., Instability in the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in adolescents (2007) Circulation, 115, p. 2316; Weiss, R., Dziura, J., Burgert, T.S., Tamborlane, W.V., Taksali, S.E., Yeckel, C.W., Allen, K., Caprio, S., Obesity and the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents (2004) New England Journal of Medicine, 350 (23), pp. 2362-2374. , DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa031049; Vikram, N.K., Misra, A., Pandey, R.M., Luthra, K., Wasir, J.S., Dhingra, V., Heterogeneous phenotypes of insulin resistance and its implications for defining metabolic syndrome in Asian Indian adolescents (2006) Atherosclerosis, 186, pp. 193-199; Li, Y., Yang, X., Zhai, F., Kok, F.J., Zhao, W., Piao, J., Zhang, J., Ma, G., Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in Chinese adolescents (2008) British Journal of Nutrition, 99 (3), pp. 565-570. , DOI 10.1017/S0007114507797064, PII S0007114507797064; Zimmet, P., Alberti, G., Kaufman, F., Tajima, N., Silink, M., Arslanian, S., The metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents (2007) Lancet, 369, p. 2059; Janssen, I., Katzmarzyk, P.T., Srinivasan, S.R., Chen, W., Malina, R.M., Bouchard, C., Berenson, G.S., Combined influence of body mass index and waist circumference on coronary artery disease risk factors among children and adolescents (2005) Pediatrics, 115 (6), pp. 1623-1630. , http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/115/6/1623, DOI 10.1542/peds.2004-2588; Teran-Garcya, M., Bouchard, C., Genetics of metabolic syndrome (2007) Appl Physiol Nutr Metab, 32, pp. 89-114; Vikram, N.K., Pandey, R.M., Misra, A., Sharma, R., Devi, J.R., Khanna, N., Non-obese (body mass index &lt; 25 kg/m2) Asian Indians with normal waist circumference have high cardiovascular risk (2003) Nutrition, 19 (6), pp. 503-509. , DOI 10.1016/S0899-9007(02)01083-3; Chandalia, M., Abate, N., Garg, A., StrayGundersen, J., Grundy, S.M., Relationship between generalized and upper body obesity to insulin resistance in Asian Indian men (1999) J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 84, pp. 2329-2335; Misra, A., Impact of ethnicity on body fat patterning in Asian Indians and blacks: Relation with insulin resistance (2003) Nutrition, 19 (9), pp. 815-816. , DOI 10.1016/S0899-9007(03)00141-2; Bhargava, S.K., Sachdev, H.S., Fall, C.H.D., Osmond, C., Lakshmy, R., Barker, D.J.P., Biswas, S.K.D., Reddy, K.S., Relation of serial changes in childhood body-mass index to impaired glucose tolerance in young adulthood (2004) New England Journal of Medicine, 350 (9), pp. 865-875. , DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa035698; Boney, C.M., Verma, A., Tucker, R., Vohr, B.R., Metabolic syndrome in childhood: Association with birth weight, maternal obesity, and gestational diabetes mellitus (2005) Pediatrics, 115 (3), pp. e290-e296. , http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/115/3/e290, DOI 10.1542/peds.2004-1808; Eckel, R.H., Grundy, S.M., Zimmet, P.Z., The metabolic syndrome (2005) Lancet, 365 (9468), pp. 1415-1428. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66378-7; Landsberg, L., Hyperinsulinemia: Possible role in obesity-induced hypertension (1992) Hypertension, 19, pp. 161-166; Assimacopoulos-Jeannet, F., Brichard, S., Rencurel, F., Cusin, I., Jeanrenaud, B., In vivo effects of hyperinsulinemia on lipogenic enzymes and glucose transporter expression in rat liver and adipose tissues (1995) Metabolism, 44, pp. 228-233; Tzou, W.S., Douglas, P.S., Srinivasan, S.R., Bond, M.G., Tang, R., Chen, W., Berenson, G.S., Stein, J.H., Increased subclinical atherosclerosis in young adults with metabolic syndrome: The Bogalusa Heart Study (2005) Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 46 (3), pp. 457-463. , DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2005.04.046, PII S0735109705010375; Wijeyaratne, C.N., Balen, A.H., Barth, J.H., Belchetz, P.E., Clinical manifestations and insulin resistance (IR) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among South Asians and Caucasians: Is there a difference?

We also assessed whether performance on the saving paradigm was related to theory of mind performance. Children saved significantly more marbles on the second trial than the first and saved significantly more when a future reward was more desirable than a present reward (rather than the reverse). However, older children did not save significantly more than younger children.

In a semantic task, children located temporal distances from today that were described using conventional, temporal terms on a spatial timeline. In an autobiographical task, children judged temporal distances on the same spatial timeline for events that they had experienced, or were going to experience, presented without explicit temporal references. Six-year-olds were equally accurate in judging temporal distances in the semantic and autobiographical tasks, but 7-year-olds were more accurate in the semantic task. Older children were more accurate than younger children in the semantic task, but no significant age differences were found for autobiographical events. Surprisingly, children were equally accurate in locating past and future events in time. Children at both ages were more accurate judging temporal distances up to one week away (both past and future) as compared to distances of two to four weeks across both tasks. Results suggest that knowledge of recurring time patterns and conventional time measurement systems is necessary, but not sufficient, for locating autobiographical events in time, and temporal distance plays an important role in children's temporal judgments. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Autobiographical memory; Episodic foresight; Semantic memory; Temporal reasoning",,,,,,"Ames, L.B., The development of the sense of time in the young child (1946) Journal of Genetic Psychology, 68, pp. 97-126; Atance, C.M., Future thinking in young children (2008) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17, pp. 295-298; Atance, C.M., Jackson, L.K., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102, pp. 379-391; Atance, C., O'Neill, D.K., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5, pp. 533-539; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., The emergence of episodic future thinking in humans (2005) Learning and Motivation, 36, pp. 126-144; Busby, J., Suddendorf, T., Recalling yesterday and predicting tomorrow (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 362-372; Busby Grant, J., Suddendorf, T., Preschoolers begin to differentiate the times of events from throughout the lifespan (2009) European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 6, pp. 746-762; Friedman, W.J., The development of children's understanding of cyclic aspects of time (1977) Child Development, 48, pp. 1593-1599; Friedman, W.J., The development of time concepts in children (1978) Advances in Child Development and Behavior, 12, pp. 267-298; Friedman, W.J., The development of children's knowledge of temporal structure (1986) Child Development, 57, pp. 1386-1400; Friedman, W.J., Children's representations of the pattern of daily activities (1990) Child Development, 61, pp. 1399-1412; Friedman, W.J., The development of children's memory for the time of past events (1991) Child Development, 62, pp. 139-155; Friedman, W.J., Children's time memory: The development of a differentiated past (1992) Cognitive Development, 7, pp. 171-187; Friedman, W.J., Memory for the time of past events (1993) Psychological Bulletin, 113, pp. 44-66; Friedman, W.J., The development of children's knowledge of the times of future events (2000) Child Development, 71, pp. 913-932; Friedman, W.J., Children's knowledge of the future distances of daily activities and annual events (2002) Journal of Cognition and Development, 3, pp. 333-356; Friedman, W.J., The development of a differentiated sense of the past and the future (2003) Advances in Child Development and Behavior, 31, pp. 229-269; Friedman, W.J., Developmental and cognitive perspectives on humans' sense of the times of past and future events (2005) Learning and Motivation, 36, pp. 145-158; Friedman, W.J., Gardner, A.G., Zubin, N.R.E., Children's comparisons of the recency of two events from the past year (1995) Child Development, 66, pp. 970-983; Friedman, W.J., Huttenlocher, J., Memory for the times of "" 60 Minutes"" stories and news events (1997) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory & Cognition, 23, pp. 560-569; Friedman, W.J., Kemp, S., The effects of elapsed time and retrieval on young children's judgments of the temporal distances of past events (1998) Cognitive Development, 13, pp. 335-367; Friedman, W.J., Lyon, T.D., Development of temporal-reconstructive abilities (2005) Child Development, 76, pp. 1202-1216; Hudson, J.A., "" Do you know what we're going to do this summer?""

The postwar, centralised approach to spatial planning and countryside management has come under increasing challenge from domestic and international needs and concerns. European policy influence has increased in respect of agriculture and the natural environment. Zoning of land-use and a restrictive approach to built development have gradually weakened, and land-use drivers have become more multifunctional. Policy has moved away from a 'top-down' process designed in Whitehall towards a multi-layered structure within which international agreements and negotiations must be reconciled with regional and local, partnership-based approaches to planning and management, via national frameworks and a complex mix of regulatory and market-based instruments. Climate and energy policy, as well as policies on food and health, will require new and more diverse forms of development. A major challenge for the future could be the extent to which current, multi-layered spatial planning policies can accommodate the scale of change implied by the new mix of drivers from other policy areas. There is the possibility of an increasingly differentiated response across the UK countryside, as well as much more radical change in the system driven from the centre, as pressures increase.While the Government Office for Science commissioned this review, the views are those of the author, are independent of Government, and do not constitute Government policy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Challenges; Future; Governance systems; Institutional analysis; Rural land use policy","energy policy; environmental policy; governance approach; international agreement; land use planning; rural policy; spatial planning; zoning policy; United Kingdom",,,,,"Baldock, D., Dwyer, J., Sumpsi-Vinas, J., (2002) Environmental Integration and the CAP, , European Commission, DG Agriculture, CEC, Brussels; Barlow, M., (1940), Report of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population, Cmd 6153, HMSO, London; Body, S.R., (1982) Agriculture: The Triumph and the Shame., , Avebury, UK; Bowers, R., Cheshire, P., (1983), Agriculture, the Countryside and Land Use.

But just like in other domains of Nature, it is possible that much of the brain and mind's operation can be explained with a small set of universal principles. Given exciting recent developments in theory, and empirical findings and computational studies, it seems that the generation of predictions might be one strong candidate for such a universal principle. This is the focus of this book. From the predictions required when a rat navigates a maze to food-caching in scrub-jays; from predictions essential in decision-making to social interactions; from predictions in the retina to the prefrontal cortex; and from predictions in early development to foresight in non-humans. The perspectives represented in this collection span a spectrum from the cellular underpinnings to the computational principles underlying future-related mental processes, and from systems neuroscience to cognition and emotion. In spite of this diversity, they share some core elements. Memory, for instance, is critical in any framework that explains predictions. In asking ""what is next?"" our brains have to refer to memory and experience on the way to simulating our mental future. But as much as this collection offers answers to important questions, it raises and emphasizes outstanding ones. How are experiences coded optimally to afford using them for predictions? How do we construct a new simulation from separate memories? How specific in detail are future-oriented thoughts, and when do they rely on imagery, concepts, or language? © 2011 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

On the other hand, the publishing of excellent books is not merely the business of publishing industry, it calls for the joint efforts of the authors, readers, administration and publishers; it's necessary to draw the attention of the whole society and create an atmosphere thirsty for the publishing of excellent books. What's more, we need to curtail expenditure in publishing industry, remove the weeds from publishing industry and provide fertile soil for the publishing of excellent books.

From macrohistory, the grand patterns of social change reveal some of the key systems dynamics influencing the rise and fall of cities in civilisation. The key urban system dynamics in the broadest sense provide a meta-framework of emerging issues shaping new urban challenges or opportunities for our towns and cities. The hope drawn from the past and present is to focus our urban interventions in the key areas to create future cities of wonder and purpose.

The success of knowledge-based innovations such as vaccinomics is not only contingent on access to new biotechnologies. It also requires new ways of governance of science, knowledge production, and management. This article presents a conceptual analysis of the anticipatory and adaptive approaches that are crucial for the responsible design and sustainable transition of vaccinomics to public health practice. Anticipatory governance is a new approach to manage the uncertainties embedded on an innovation trajectory with participatory foresight, in order to devise governance instruments for collective ""steering"" of science and technology. As a contrast to hitherto narrowly framed ""downstream impact assessments"" for emerging technologies, anticipatory governance adopts a broader and interventionist approach that recognizes the social construction of technology design and innovation. It includes in its process explicit mechanisms to understand the factors upstream to the innovation trajectory such as deliberation and cocultivation of the aims, motives, funding, design, and direction of science and technology, both by experts and publics. This upstream shift from a consumer ""product uptake"" focus to ""participatory technology design"" on the innovation trajectory is an appropriately radical and necessary departure in the field of technology assessment, especially given that considerable public funds are dedicated to innovations. Recent examples of demands by research funding agencies to anticipate the broad impacts of proposed research - at a very upstream stage at the time of research funding application - suggest that anticipatory governance with foresight may be one way how postgenomics scientific practice might transform in the future toward responsible innovation. Moreover, the present context of knowledge production in vaccinomics is such that policy making for vaccines of the 21st century is occurring in the face of uncertainties where the ""facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent and where no single one of these dimensions can be managed in isolation from the rest."" This article concludes, however, that uncertainty is not an accident of the scientific method, but its very substance. Anticipatory governance with participatory foresight offers a mechanism to respond to such inherent sociotechnical uncertainties in the emerging field of vaccinomics by making the coproduction of scientific knowledge by technology and the social systems explicit. Ultimately, this serves to integrate scientific and social knowledge thereby steering innovations to coproduce results and outputs that are socially robust and context sensitive. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"anticipatory governance; biomedical technology assessment; biomics; funding; human; management; medical practice; medical research; nonhuman; participatory management; priority journal; review; vaccinomics; Diffusion of Innovation; Humans; Preventive Medicine; Public Opinion; Vaccination; Vaccines",,"Vaccines",,,"Adamczyk-Poplawska, M., Markowicz, S., Jagusztyn-Krynicka, E.K., Proteomics for development of vaccine (2011) J.

Its roots are traced from parentage, the international criminal tribunals for the formerYugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR) with their ad hoc temporal nature, through the formation of these Tribunals' completion strategies and subsequent implementation efforts. The next section highlights how the implementation phase included a dimension of foresight as to the impact of mandate completion on the continuing work (or legacy) of the Tribunals within national jurisdictions. This in turn gave rise to identifying the need for a mechanism to carry out the Tribunals' essential, residual functions after closure. Thereafter, the article focuses on the process of deciding upon which qualities this mechanism-to-be should possess as it evolved over time into the form and substance of a Tribunal in its own right. The author devotes the final section of the article to describing the main features of the IRMCT, created by Security Council Resolution 1966 on 22 December 2010, in terms of its statutory developments compared to the ICTYand ICTR. © Oxford University Press, 2011, All rights reserved.",,,,,,,"Note; Hazan, P., (2004) Justice in a Time ofWar: The True Story Behind the International Criminal Tribunal for the FormerYugoslavia, pp. 43-63. , (College Station: Texas A & M University Press); Note; Holbrooke, R., (1998) To End a War, p. 90. , The role of the ICTY in the Dayton Agreement negotiations of November 1995 might serve as one example.

In early 2007, the Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) was commissioned to offer a forward-looking review of the Livable Communities strategy of AARP, originally, the American Association of Retired Persons (with 37 million members, AARP is the largest non-profit organization in the US) [1]. This article summarizes the process and results of that project. It constitutes a case study in the evaluation of a large organization's plans from a strategic foresight perspective. Findings from this investigation suggest that many large-scale trends in the U.S., including urban sprawl, rising energy costs, climate change, and fiscal challenges are likely to work against efforts to make communities more livable. On the basis of these findings, IAF recommended that the association take a broad approach to livability, developing strategies that counter these negative trends while also improving the lives of older people. AARP is one of the best suited organizations to make such a long-term commitment. © 2011.",,"climate change; development strategy; fiscal policy; future prospect; price dynamics; strategic approach; trend analysis; urban planning; United States",,,,,"The IAF team for this project, in addition to the authors included P.

Design/methodology/approach: Books are grouped in nine categories: Global trends, Losing autonomy, Faculty, Students, Finance, Digitization, Curriculum, Diversity, and Moving forward. A concluding Coda discusses an important new paradigm of four types of scholarship, proposed in the seminal 1990 report on Scholarship Reconsidered, and the two types of scholarship that continue to be badly lacking in the academy, to the detriment of the world, the nation, and higher education itself. Findings: American higher education is undergoing many changes and stresses, and all of the books considered here point to a ""bleak horizon"" in various ways, in part caused by the outdated structure of higher education. Altbach issues a timely call for a new ""sense of academic mission,"" which is discussed in the Coda.

Since water of this quality is required only for drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing, delivering such water for uses that require non-drinking water quality represents a tremendous waste of water and energy, and contributes to environmental pollution. Design/methodology/approach: An overview of dual distribution networks in several countries is presented. Kuwait, in which 86 percent of the freshwater network has a parallel brackish water network, is the leader in this field, with brackish water used for a range of outdoor activities. The residential sector is the major consumer of freshwater in Kuwait and the control of demand in this sector will be a key factor in curbing the overall demand, which without any demand management measures is expected to quadruple by 2025. Computer modeling based on existing water use statistics and the proposed phasing-in of a dual distribution network for indoor use in households has been undertaken to determine how the large quantities of reclaimed can be used to reduce drinking water consumption. Findings: The paper presents a modeling exercise that demonstrates that by using reverse osmosis (RO) treated wastewater for toilet flushing and watering the gardens, water consumption demand can be stabilized at present levels over a 20-year period. Originality/value: The paper concludes that with foresight and long-term planning it is feasible to implement a dual water supply network in a major city, on a scale which may lead to saving up to 25 percent of drinking quality water on top of other traditional water conservation measures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cities;

In some recent publications, however, it has been claimed that not Boveri but primarily David von Hansemann deserves credit for these chromosomal theories of cancer origin. The claim seems to be unjustified because there are great differences, both in conception and in argumentation, between both opinions. In addition, it has been ignored that von Hansemann himself said that his views ""were corrected and developed further by Boveri"". In this paper two obviously unknown comments regarding Boveri's theory by von Hansemann are presented as examples. Furthermore, the paper points out that the pathologist von Hansemann was engaged in the formal genesis of tumors using descriptive methods. By contrast, the embryologist Boveri developed his hypotheses on the basis of the experimentally founded chromosome theory of inheritance in an attempt to explain the etiology or causal genesis of tumors. Thus, it can be concluded that Boveri developed the first genetic cancer theory in the history of medicine. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Quite legitimately, an increasing number of individuals are aspiring to a standard of living comparable to that of the industrialized countries and this is increasing the demand for basic raw materials (oil, gas, metals etc.) at the very point where production capabilities in certain sectors are reaching their limits. In such a context, there are ever greater needs in the area of mineral resources for exploration, prospecting and the improvement of extraction systems. Unfortunately, as Jacques Varet shows in this article, for lack of sufficient investment in the relevant scientific training in recent decades the world is short of qualified personnel to meet those needs. Basing himself on various foresight studies he has coordinated on employment in the geosciences up to the years 2020/2030, Jacques Varet provides a global conspectus on employment and training in this field. Reviewing the development of occupations in this field over the last 30 years, he shows that it is the environmental sector that has enabled in-depth training to be maintained in the geosciences, because the extractive industries and exploration went through a lean period between 1985 and 2005. Since then, however, these industries have seen a real revival. Given that many workers in these sectors will be retiring in the coming years, the jobs market in the geosciences is very buoyant and should remain so despite the crisis. The shortage of personnel trained in the field should persist, if not indeed intensify, until 2030. This situation applies in most of the countries concerned (USA, Canada, Europe). More precisely, where France is concerned, Jacques Varet stresses the country's assets and weaknesses in this area and makes a number of recommendations for the French training system to meet the needs of the sector and attract people to it as a career.",,,,,,,"Barré, R., De Laat, B., Theys, J., (2007) Management de la Recherche.

This has had a direct impact on the price of these - often strategic - materials in the IT, telecoms and other sectors. However, where many minerals are concerned, one area remains that has so far been unexploited, but is nonetheless very promising: the ocean beds. Ifremer, aware of this potential wealth and the urgent need to guarantee lasting supplies of these strategic resources both for France and for Europe, launched a foresight exercise in 2009 on deep sea mineral resources with a time-horizon of 2030. Denis Lacroix and Yves Fouquet, who were members of the study's steering group, outline it for us here. After recalling the international context and the different minerals and metals present in the ocean depths, they underscore the crucial issues in this field: these are scientific and economic, given the potential wealth of environmental deposits (biodiversity, preservation of ecosystems, etc.), but also legal and technological. They then present the three scenarios selected by the study: ""Crisis and Compartmentalization, Political Tensions""; ""Cycles as Usual""; and ""Global Crises"". They end by teasing out the possible prospects for France and Europe, stressing the need to gain a foothold as soon as possible in the global competition in this sector, in terms of positioning industry for the exploration and exploitation of resources, assessing the scale of resources, applications for exploration permits, public/private cooperation etc. Given its technological resources and longrecognized skills in the study of the ocean beds, France must remain a major player in this sector, particularly at a point when it is coming to be of crucial strategic interest.",,,,,,,"Matières premières "" - Répondre à nos besoins fondamentaux pour assurer la croissance et créer des emplois en Europe (2008) COM, p. 699. , Bruxelles : communication de la Commission au Parlement européen et au Conseil, 4 novembre 2008; (2010) Critical Raw Materials for the UE: Report of the Ad-hoc Working Group on Defining Critical Raw Materials, , Bruxelles : Commission européenne; Paris : La documentation française, 2009","Lacroix, D.; Institut Français de Recherche Pour l'Exploitation de la MerFrance",,,,,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

The first step in defining the role of ecohydrology for implementation of the EU water framework directive should be the analysis of the pattern of scientific methodologies that stimulate recent progress in environmental sciences. Such progress has been directly translated into 'good ecological status' of inland and coastal waters. From the perspective of the evolution of paradigms in environmental sciences during recent decades, three stages can be distinguished. The first two are information (structure states, relationships) and knowledge (through integration of different scientific disciplines, synergies in information can highlight the patterns and processes (e.g. ecohydrology)). The third and most advanced stage of the science is wisdom - the ability to use information and knowledge to develop innovative solutions of environmental problems with consideration of priorities to society. The conceptual framework for transition from the first to the second and third stages is provided by three principles of ecohydrology: hydrological (information on the abiotic structure of a river basin; dynamics of hydrological processes and spatial temporal specifics of anthropogenic impacts); ecological (the potential for basin resilience enhancement); ecotechnological (the use of information and knowledge for the development of new ecological biotechnologies and system solutions). The implicit conclusion is that in order to accelerate cost-efficient implementation of the EU water framework directive, more effort has to be put into the transition from research to interdisciplinary efforts to deepen our knowledge of processes and regulatory mechanisms within ecosystems. Further progress from knowledge to wisdom has to be made by broader involvement of environmental scientists who use foresight methodology for harmonization technologies, environmental potential and cultural heritage in large-scale projects of environment restoration and sustainable development of infrastructure.",,"Anthropogenic impacts; Coastal waters; Conceptual frameworks; Cost-efficient; Cultural heritages; Eco-hydrology; Ecological process; Ecological status; Environmental problems; Environmental science; Environmental scientists; Environmental sustainability; Hydrological cycles; Hydrological process; Innovative solutions; Large-scale projects; Recent progress; Regulatory mechanism; River basins; Scientific discipline; Scientific methodology; Spatial temporals; System solution; Three stages; Water Framework Directives; Ecology; Hydrology; Information use; Water conservation; Sustainable development; conceptual framework; ecohydrology; environmental policy; environmental restoration; European Union; hydrological cycle; policy implementation; sustainability; sustainable development; water management",,,,,"Agostinho, A.A., Gomes, L.C., Verissimo, S., Flood regime, dam regulation and fish in the upper Paraná river: Effects on assemblage attributes, reproduction and recruitment (2004) Reviews of Fish Biology and Fishery, 14 (1), pp. 11-19; Altinakar, M., Kiedrzyńska, E., Magnuszewski, A., Modelling of inundation pattern at Pilica river floodplain, Poland (2006) Climate Variability and Change - Hydrological Impacts, pp. 579-585. , Proceedings of the 5th FRIEND World Conference, Havana (Demuth S, et al.

Excessive use of fossil fuels due to industrial developments in recent years has caused serious problems regarding ecology, environment and resource management, as far as it made global challenges to control the consumption of fossil fuels. This research has accomplished to predict global fossil fuel consumption in coming decays. The records of data from global usage, indicates intrinsic chaotic behaviour of the data, therefore anticipation seems to be more difficult to implement it with conventional tools of time series prediction. In this paper a new approach is proposed as Amygdala-Orbitofrontal emotional learning model, to foresight the universal trend of fossil fuel consumption. Simulation results prove that the applied method has prominent capability in forecasting chaotic time series. Thus, it can be claimed that the ultimate results is admissible for future works. © 2011 AmirKabir Univ of Tech.","Chaos; Emotional Learning; Fossil Fuel; Prediction; Time Series","Chaotic behaviour; Chaotic time series; Emotional learning; Industrial development; Resource management; Simulation result; Sources of energy; Time series prediction; Electrical engineering; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Steel metallurgy; Time series; Air pollution control",,,,,"Houghton, J., (2009) Global Warming the Complete Briefing, , 4th eddition, Cambridge University Press; Ghiaseddin, M., (2007) Air Pollution-Resources, Effects Abd Control, , University of Tehran Press (In Persian); Erfan Manesh, M., Afyouni, M., (2008) Environment Pollution: Water, Soil and Air, , Arkan Danesh Press (In Persian); Hargreaves, J.C., Annan, J.D., Using ensemble prediction methods to examine regional climate variation under global warming scenarios (2006) Ocean Modelling, 11 (1-2), pp. 174-192. , DOI 10.1016/j.ocemod.2004.12.004, PII S1463500305000065; Nakicenovic, N., Swart, R., (2000) Emissions Scenarios, , Cambridge University Press, A Special Report of Intergovernmental Pannel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group III; Wu, J.-D., Liu, J.C., Development of a predictive system for car fuel consumption using an artificial neural network (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, , in press; Altan Dombayci, O., The prediction of heating energy consumption in a model house by using artificial neural networks in Denizli-Turkey (2010) Advances in Engineering Software, 41 (2), pp. 141-147; Ekici, B.B., Aksoya, U.T., Prediction of building energy consumption by using artificial neural networks (2009) Advances in Engineering Software, 40 (5), pp. 356-362; Cobb, L., The causes of global warming: A graphical approach (2008) Quaker Economist, 7 (158); Climate Prediction Unit, , http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk; (2010) British Petroleum's Statistical Review of World Energy, , http://www.bp.com; Khodapanahi, M.K., (2008) Physiolofical Psychology, , SAMT Press (In Persian); Engelbrecht, A.P., (2007) Computational Intelligence: An Introduction, , John Wiely & Sons Ltd, Secon Edition; Jang, J.-S.R., Sun, C.-T., Mizutani, E., (2005) Neuro-Fuzzy and Soft Computing: A Computational Approach to Learning and Machine Intelligence, , New Dehli: Prentice Hall of India Pvt Ltd; Moren, J., Balkenius, C., (2002) Emotion and Learning-A Computational Model of the Amygdala, , Ph.D. Thesis, Lund University, Sweden; Moren, J., Balkenius, C., A computational model of emotional learning in the amygdala (2000) Proc. the 6th International Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior, , USA; Babaie, T., Karimizandi, R., Lucas, C., Learning based brain emotional intelligence as a new aspect for development of an alarm system (2008) Soft Computing, 12 (9), pp. 857-873. , DOI 10.1007/s00500-007-0258-8; Mehrabian, A.R., Lucas, C., Roshanian, J., Design of an aerospace launch vehicle autopilot based on optimized emotional learning algorithm (2008) Cybernetics and Systems, 39 (3), pp. 284-303. , DOI 10.1080/01969720801944364, PII 792368150; Rouhani, H., Jalili, M., Araabi, B.N., Eppler, W., Lucas, C., Brain emotional learning based intelligent controller applied to neurofuzzy model of micro-heat exchanger (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 32 (3), pp. 911-918. , DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2006.01.047, PII S0957417406000479; Lucas, C., Khaki Sedigh, A., Emotional learning as a new tool for development of agent-based system (2003) Informatica, 27 (2), pp. 137-144; Balkenius, C., Morén, J., Winberg, S., Interactions between motivation, emotion and attention: From biology to robotics (2009) Proc. the Ninth International Conference on Epigenetic Robotics.

In these systems electrical output per unit area of active materials increases nearly linearly with concentration factor, thereby reducing the cost of active materials per watt by up to a factor of 10. All PV systems are exposed to multifactor and cyclic environmental stressors including solar irradiance, temperature and humidity which can each cause degradation over time. This issue is compounded in LCPV because concentration of solar irradiance can amplify these stressors. While primary optical elements of LCPV systems are typically only exposed to normal sun irradiance, secondary optical elements are exposed to multiple sun intensities which can degrade them faster. Concentrating sunlight intensifies the problem of thermal management and since most LCPV systems use crystalline silicon cells, increased temperature decreases overall efficiency. From this point of view, it is very important to have foresight about materials in PV system before they have been used. This paper will discuss solar and environmental durability of acrylic and mirror components of PV systems from a standpoint of durability and reliability of LCPV. Photodarkening and photobleaching were observed in a typical silicone at 3.8 kW/m2 irradiance and measurements we used to calculate the Induced Absorbance to Dose (IAD) values of 0.3 and -1.25 ΔAbs/cm per GJ dose. At 48 kW/m2 irradiance, only photodarkening appears with 0.2ΔAbs/cm per GJ dose. In addition, photodarkening and photobleaching were also observed in PMMA sample with IAD values of 0.2 and -0.4 ΔAbs/cm per GJ dose, respectively. © 2011 IEEE.","concentrating photovoltaic; lifetime and degradation science; reliability; solar radiation durability","Absorbances; Active material; Concentrating photovoltaic; Concentration factors; Cost competitiveness; Crystalline silicon cells; Electrical output; Environmental durability; Environmental stressors; Increased temperature; lifetime and degradation science; Low concentrations; Multi-factor; Overall efficiency; Per unit; Photovoltaic systems; PV system; Solar irradiances; Competition; Concentration (process); Degradation; Durability; Optics; Photobleaching; Photovoltaic effects; Secondary batteries; Silicones; Solar radiation; Sun; Solar power generation",,,,,"Rosenthal, A.L., Lane, C.G., Field Test Results for the 6 MW Carrizo Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant (1991) Solar Cells, 30, pp. 563-571; Gay, C.F., Berman, E., Performance of large photovoltaic systems (1990) Chemtech; Kemp, M., Polymeric Testing Consideration for Photovoltaic Applications (2010) NIST/UL Workshop on Polymer for Photovoltaic Applications; http://www.er.doe.gov/bes/reports/files/SETF_rpt.pdf; French, R.H., Rodríguez-Parada, J.M., Yang, M.K., Derryberry, R.A., Pfeiffenberger, N.T., Optical Properties of Polymeric Materials for Concentrator Photovoltaic Systems Solar Energy Materails and Solar Cells, , to be published in; French, R.H., Rodriguez-Parada, J.M., Yang, M.K., Lemon, M.F., Romano, E.C., Boydell, P., Materials for Concentrator Photovoltaic Systems: Optical Properties and Solar Radiation Durability Proceedings of CPV-6: International Conference on Concentrating Photovoltaics, Freiburg, Germany, April 2010; French, R.H., Rodríguez-Parada, J.M., Yang, M.K., Derryberry, R.A., Lemon, M.F., Brown, M.J., Haeger, C.R., Richardson, R.E., Optical Properties of Materials for Concentrator Photovoltaic Systems Proceedings of 34th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), Philadelphia, PA June 7-12, 2009","French, R.H.; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, 510 White Hall, Case Western Reserve University, 2111 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, Cleveland, OH 44106, United States; email: roger.french@case.edu",,,,"IEEE 2011 EnergyTech, ENERGYTECH 2011","25 May 2011 through 26 May 2011","Cleveland, OH",86000,,9781457707773,,,"English","IEEE EnergyTech, ENERGYTECH",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051583381

It gives a general overview of the social consequences and ethical issues arising from technologies that can currently be reasonably expected. This overview is used to present recommendations and integrate these in a framework of responsible innovation. Design/methodology/approach – The identification of emerging ICTs and their ethical consequences is based on the review and analysis if several different bodies of literature. The individual features of the ICTs and the ethical issues identified this way are then aggregated and analysed. Findings – The paper outlines the 11 ICTs identified. Some of the shared features that are likely to have social relevance include an increase in natural interaction, the invisibility of technology, direct links between humans and technology, detailed models and data of humans and an increasing autonomy of technology that may lead to power over the user. Ethical issues include several current topics such as privacy, data protection, intellectual property and digital divides. New problems may include changes to the way humans are perceived and the role of humans and technology in society. This includes changing power structures and different ways of treating humans. Research limitations/implications – The paper presents a piece of foresight research which cannot claim exact knowledge of the future. However, by developing a detailed understanding of possible futures it provides an important basis for current decisions relating to future technology development and governance. Practical implications – The paper spells out a range of recommendations for both policy makers and researchers/industry. These refer to the framework within which technology is developed and how such a framework could be designed to allow the development of ethical reflexivity. Social implications – The work described here is likely to influence EU policy on ICT research and technology research and innovation more broadly. This may have implications for the type of technologies funded and broad implications for the social use of emerging technologies. Originality/value – The paper presents a novel and important broad view of the future of ICTs that is required in order to inform current policy decisions. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication technologies; Ethics; Human values; Identity; Information technology; Procedural ethics",,,,,,"Beauchamp, T.L., Childress, J.F., (2008) Principles of Biomedical Ethics, , 6th ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford; Collingridge, D., (1981) The Social Control of Technology, , Palgrave Macmillan, London; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes - new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22 (2-3), pp. 93-111; COM(2010) 2020: Europe 2020 - a strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (2010), http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/; Fischer, J.M., Recent work on moral responsibility (1999) Ethics, 110 (1), pp. 93-139; Floridi, L., A look into the future impact of ICT on our lives (2007) The Information Society, 23 (1), pp. 59-64; Grunwald, A., Technology assessment or ethics of technology?

It is the result of an institutional reflective process and academic dialog, which culminated in its approval by UNAM's Academic Council for the Biology, Chemistry, and Health Sciences areas on February 2nd, 2010. Some distinguishing characteristics of the new academic curriculum are: organization by courses with a focus on outcome competencies; three curricular axes that link three knowledge areas; four educational phases with achievement profiles; new courses (biomedical informatics, basic-clinical and clinical-basic integration, among others); and core curriculum. The aforementioned curriculum was decided within a framework of effective teaching strategies, competency oriented learning assessment methods, restructuring of the training of teaching staff, and establishment of a curriculum committee follow-up and evaluation of the program. Curricular change in medical education is a complex process through which the institution can achieve its mission and vision.

Since the 1950's, nuclear fission (splitting of atoms) power has been a logical alternative in both fact and fiction, due to its ability to provide abundant power with high energy density, reliability, and immunity to severe environments. Bringing space fission power to a state of readiness for exploration has depended on clearing the hurdle of technology readiness demonstration. Due to the happy coincidence of heritage from prior space fission development efforts such as the Prometheus program, foresight from NASA's Exploration Mission Systems Directorate in the mid-2000's, and relative budget stability through the late 2000's, NASA and DOE, with their industry partners, are poised to push through to this objective. Hardware for a 12 kWe non-nuclear Fission Power System Technology Demonstration Unit is being fabricated now on a schedule that will enable a low-cost demonstration of technology readiness in the mid-2010s, with testing beginning as early as 2012. With space fission power system technology demonstrated, exploration mission planners will have the flexibility to respond to a broad variety of missions and will be able to provide abundant power so that future explorers will, in planning or crisis, have the power they need when they most need it.","Fission power systems; Space power systems","Demonstration units; Electrical power; Exploration missions; Fission power; Fission systems; High energy densities; Prometheus; Space power systems; Technology readiness; Demonstrations; NASA; Power transmission; Spacecraft power supplies; Technology",,,,,"Bennett, G.L., Hemler, R.J., Schock, A., Space Nuclear Power: An Overview (1996) Journal of Propulsion and Power, 12 (5). , September-October; Briggs, M.H., (2010) Summary of Test Results from a 1 kWe-Class Free-Piston Stirling Power Converter Integrated with a Pumped NaK Loop, , NASA/TM-2010-216934, July; Drake, B., (2009) Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0, , NASA/SP-2009-566, July; Ellis, D.L., Manufacture, Testing, and Model Validation of a Full-Scale Radiator for Fission Surface Power Application (2011) Proceedings of Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space 2011, , Paper no. 3181, Albuquerque, NM, February; Godfroy, T., Design and Build of Reactor Simulator for Fission Surface Power Technology Demonstration Unit (2011) Proceedings of Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space 2011, , Paper no. 3508, Albuquerque, NM, February; Obama, B., (2010) Remarks by the President on Space Exploration in the 21st Century, , The White House Office of the Press Secretary, John F.

This article reflects the major views and themes emerging from the conference. Several transitional pathways towards more sustainable food consumption and production were identified and these might provide a basis for forward thinking in the development of public policies and industry strategies: (a) consider expected resource scarcities in long-term research priority setting and take planetary boundaries seriously; (b) support trans-disciplinary research to understand the complexity of agri-food systems and enhance agro-ecological and resilience research; (c) give consumer-oriented research a higher priority in public funding; (d) take a cross-sectoral approach and make public agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS) fit to cope with the new and interconnected challenges; (e) explore new means of policy coordination and consider the trade-offs between different sectoral policies; and (f) take a long-term view for both research policy and research priority setting and enable more efficient research spending by strengthening transnational program cooperation.

Crediting reference levels and the coordination among different implementing entities at multiple geographic scales are discussed. A crediting reference level has an error component if it differs from the business-as-usual (BAU) without REDD. Both the BAU emissions and the impact of REDD actions are uncertain, implying that participating in REDD entails stakeholder risk, the distribution of which depends on REDD program design. To categorize REDD architectures we define scale-neutrality whereby, for a given REDD design, crediting relative to the reference level at a given scale is not affected by errors in reference levels at scales below it. Sufficient conditions are derived for scale-neutrality to hold. A Brazilian Amazon example is provided, comparing potential REDD architectures, and highlighting how a cap-and-trade approach may match the environmental outcome obtainable with perfect foresight of the BAU emissions. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,,,,,"Angelsen, A., Preface (2008) Moving Ahead with REDD: Issues, Options and Implications, , A.

Rather than the contrast between imaging, i. e. creating images that are understood as offering a view on what is out there, and imagining, i. e. creating images offering impressions of how the nanoscale could look like and images presenting visions of worlds that might be realized, it is the entanglement between imaging and imagining which is the key to understanding what images do. Three main arenas of entanglement of imag(in)ing and the tensions involved are discussed: production practices and use of visualizations of the nanoscale; imag(in)ing the future and the present; and entanglements of nanoscience and art. In these three arenas one sees struggles about which images might stand for nanotechnology, but also some stabilization of the entanglement of imag(in)ing, for example in established rules in the practices of visualizing the nanoscale. Three images have become iconic, through the combination of their wide reception and further circulation. All three, the IBM logo, the Foresight Institute's Nanogear image, and the so-called Nanolouse, depict actual or imagined technoscientific objects and are thus seen as representing technoscientific achievements - while marking out territory. © 2011 The Author(s).","Artist's impressions; Images; Imagining; Representation of nanotechnology; Visualization of the nanoscale",,,,,,"Andre, G., Kulakauskas, S., Chapot-Chartier, M.-P., Navet, B., Deghorain, M., Bernard, E., Hols, P., Dufrêne, Y.F., Imaging the nanoscale organization of peptidoglycan in living Lactococcus lactis cells (2010) Nat Commun, 1, p. 27. , doi:10.1038/ncomms1027; Bachtold, A., Hadley, P., Nakanishi, T., Dekker, C., Logic circuits with carbon nanotube transistors (2001) Science, 294, pp. 1317-1320; Brown, M.B., (2009) Science in Democracy.

The challenges ahead for the European agri-food system differ in their complexity, scale and speed to those we have faced in the past, pointing to a new level of change. The interconnections between these combined challenges and the limited understanding of the various feedback loops linking them, contribute to uncertainty about future developments. There is growing evidence, however, that these challenges are so large that a 'business-as usual' approach is not an option and that transformative change is needed which will open up a window for innovation, new ideas and new paradigms. Three pathways have been identified to guide the transition to a sustainable agri-food system: consumption changes, technological innovation and organisational innovation. To make the transition successful, research and innovation programmes should be transformed in order to tackle these challenges and to produce the necessary system innovations. Diversity of approaches and paradigms, transdisciplinarity, experimentation in both the technological and social realm and coordination should be promoted in the design of the research and innovation programmes. © 2011 The Agricultural Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists.",,"agricultural research; European Union; food consumption; food production; innovation; sustainable development",,,,,"(2009), FAO.

Since previous preclinical work has been limited primarily to using single tasks as predictor variables, the present study determined if measuring multiple tasks of sensation seeking and impulsivity would be useful in predicting amphetamine self-administration in rats. Multiple tasks were also used as predictor variables of dopamine transporter function in the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortexes, as these neural systems have been implicated in sensation seeking and impulsivity. Rats were tested on six behavioral tasks as predictor variables to evaluate sensation seeking (locomotor activity, novelty place preference, and sucrose reinforcement on a progressive ratio schedule) and impulsivity (delay discounting, cued go/no-go, and passive avoidance), followed by d-amphetamine self-administration (0.0056-0.1 mg/kg infusion) and kinetic analysis of dopamine transporter function as outcome variables. The combination of these predictor variables into a multivariate approach failed to yield any clear relationship among predictor and outcome measures. Using multivariate approaches to understand the relation between individual predictor and outcome variables in preclinical models may be hindered by alterations in behavior due to training and thus, the relation between various individual differences in behavior and drug self-administration may be better assessed using a univariate approach in which a only a single task is used as the predictor variable. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Amphetamine; Impulsivity; Individual differences; Rats; Sensation seeking","dexamphetamine; dopamine; dopamine transporter; sucrose; animal experiment; animal model; article; behavior change; controlled study; impulsiveness; individualization; kinetics; locomotion; male; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; orbital cortex; outcome variable; passive avoidance; place preference; predictor variable; prefrontal cortex; rat; reinforcement; sensation; task performance; training; univariate analysis; Amphetamine; Amphetamine-Related Disorders; Animals; Avoidance Learning; Behavior, Animal; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Conditioning, Operant; Dopamine; Exploratory Behavior; Impulsive Behavior; Individuality; Male; Motivation; Motor Activity; Multivariate Analysis; Prefrontal Cortex; Rats; Reinforcement (Psychology); Reward; Self Administration; Sensation; Synaptosomes",,"dexamphetamine, 1462-73-3, 51-63-8, 51-64-9; dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1; Amphetamine, 300-62-9; Central Nervous System Stimulants",,,"Ainslie, G., Specious reward: A behavioral theory of impulsiveness and impulse control (1975) Psychological Bulletin, 82, pp. 463-496; Andrucci, G., Archer, R.P., Pancoast, D.L., Gordon, R.A., The relationship of MMPI and Sensation Seeking Scales to adolescent drug use (1989) Journal of Personality Assessment, 53, pp. 253-266; Anker, J.J., Perry, J.L., Gliddon, L.A., Carroll, M.E., Impulsivity predicts the escalation of cocaine self-administration in rats (2009) Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior, 93, pp. 343-348; Arnold, J.M., Roberts, D.C.S., A critique of fixed and progressive ratio schedules used to examine the neural substrates of drug reinforcement (1997) Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior, 57, pp. 441-447; Bardo, M.T., Bowling, S.L., Robinet, P.M., Rowlett, J.K., Lacy, M., Mattingly, B.A., Role of D1 and D2 receptors in novelty-maintained place preference (1993) Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology, 1, pp. 101-109; Belin, D., Mar, A.C., Dalley, J.W., Robbins, T.W., Everitt, B.J., High impulsivity predicts the switch to compulsive cocaine-taking (2008) Science, 320, pp. 1353-1354; Brady, J.V., Animal models for assessing drugs of abuse (1991) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 15, pp. 35-43; Brown, P.L., Jenkins, H.M., Auto-shaping of the pigeon's key-peck (1968) Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 11, pp. 1-8; Cain, M.E., Denehy, E.D., Bardo, M.T., Individual differences in amphetamine self-administration: The role of the central nucleus of the amygdala (2008) Neuropsychopharmacology, 33, pp. 1149-1161; Cain, M.E., Dotson, W.F., Bardo, M.T., Individual differences in the effect of novel environmental stimuli prior to amphetamine self-administration in rats (Rattus norvegicus (2006) Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology, 14, pp. 389-401; Cain, M.E., Saucier, D.A., Bardo, M.T., Novelty seeking and drug use: Contribution of an animal model (2005) Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology, 13, pp. 367-375; Camacho, F., Smith, C.P., Vargas, H.M., Winslow, J.T., α2-Adrenoceptor antagonists potentiate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor effects on passive avoidance learning in the rat (1996) Psychopharmacology, 124, pp. 347-354; Cloninger, C., Przybeck, T.R., Svrakic, D.M., The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire: U.S. (1991) normative data.

Box 11155-9363, Tehran, Iran","This paper proposes a decentralized market-based model for long-term capacity investment decisions in a liberalized electricity market with significant wind power generation. In such an environment, investment and construction decisions are based on price signal feedbacks and imperfect foresight of future conditions in electricity market. System dynamics concepts are used to model structural characteristics of power market such as, long-term firms' behavior and relationships between variables, feedbacks and time delays. For conventional generation units, short-term price feedback for generation dispatching of forward market is implemented as well as long-term price expectation for profitability assessment in capacity investment. For wind power generation, a special framework is proposed in which generation firms are committed depending on the statistical nature of wind power. The method is based on the time series stochastic simulation process for prediction of wind speed using historical and probabilistic data. The auto-correlation nature of wind speed and the correlation with demand fluctuations are modeled appropriately. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is employed to assess the effect of demand growth rate and wind power uncertainties. Such a decision model enables the companies to find out the possible consequences of their different investment decisions. Different regulatory policies and market conditions can also be assessed by ISOs and regulators to check the performance of market rules. A case study is presented exhibiting the effectiveness of the proposed model for capacity expansion of electricity markets in which the market prices and the generation capacities are fluctuating due to uncertainty of wind power generation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity investment; Electricity market; System dynamics; Time series simulation; Wind power generation","Capacity expansion; Capacity investment; Conventional generation; Decision models; Demand fluctuations; Demand growth; Electricity market; Forward market; Generation capacity; Investment decisions; Liberalized electricity market; Market condition; Market price; Monte carlo simulation technique; Power markets; Price signals; Probabilistic data; Regulatory policies; Stochastic characteristic; Stochastic simulations; Structural characteristics; System Dynamics; Time series simulation; Wind speed; Commerce; Computer simulation; Costs; Electric generators; Electric industry; Electricity; Feedback; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Profitability; Rating; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; System theory; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Wind effects; Wind power; Electric power generation; decentralization; decision making; energy market; growth rate; investment; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; power generation; profitability; stochasticity; theoretical study; time series analysis; wind power",,,,,"Shahidehpour, M., Yamin, H., Li, Z., (2002) Market operations in electric power systems, , Wiley InterSience, New York; Dyner, I., Larsen, E.R., From planning to strategy in the electricity industry (2001) Energy Policy, 29, pp. 1145-1154; Olsina, F., Garces, F., Haubrich, H.J., Modeling long-term dynamics of electricity markets (2006) Energy Policy, 34, pp. 1411-1433; Bunn, D.W., Larsen, E.R., Sensitivity of reserve margin to factors influencing investment behavior in the electricity markets of England and Wales (1992) Energy Policy, 20, pp. 420-429; Bunn, D.W., Larsen, E.R., Assessment of uncertainty and regulation of electricity investment using an industry simulation model (1994) Utilities Pol, 4, pp. 229-236; Gary, S., Larsen, E.R., Improving firm performance in out-of-equilibrium deregulated markets using feedback simulation Models (2000) Energy Policy, 28 (12), pp. 845-855; Ford, A., Cycles in competitive electricity markets: a simulation study of the Western US (1999) Energy Policy, 27, pp. 627-658; Ford, A., Waiting for the boom: a simulation study of power plant construction in California (2001) Energy Policy, 29, pp. 847-869; Botterud, A., Korpas, M., Vogstad, K., Wangensteen, I., (2002), A dynamic simulation model for long-term analysis of the power market.

Design/methodology/approach – The critique reviews a series of pitfalls delaying or otherwise obstructing strategic planners and negotiators. Findings – The paper analyzes briefly the status of the proposed alliance and what could retard, seriously alter, or preclude completion of a meaningful treaty. Research limitations/implications – A principal hindrance to full scenario development by the European powers concerned is lagging unanimity and therefore enthusiasm, and among African/Near Eastern nations an atmosphere of exclusion, hostilities or terrorism. Practical implications – The proposed agreement may be delayed in both the short and medium terms or else die a-borning. Originality/value – Examples of earlier international understandings provide minimal guidance to otherwise ambitious planners.

As a result the dramatic urbanisation process is depleting the world's resources and the chief culprit behind climate change. Resilient cities can adapt to changes, grand challenges and can balance ecosystem and human functions. Spatial planning aims at making cities more resilient and sustainable which requires innovation, foresight, effective partnership and networks among all actors involved in urban planning processes. In practice, the implementation of these ideas is difficult because cities are dynamic structures and spatial planning processes as well as their outputs are very diverse across Europe and the world. Harmonised spatial planning information and spatial data infrastructures (SDI) encourage monitoring and more transparent planning processes. SDI can be a supportive element for spatial planning processes as it provides important harmonised data input and helps to better understand the complexity of cities and planning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","data harmonisation; resilient cities; SDI; spatial planning; sustainability","data harmonisation; Data input; Dynamic structure; Grand Challenge; One step; Planning process; resilient cities; SDI; Spatial data infrastructure; Spatial planning; Urban areas; Dynamic structure; Grand Challenge; Harmonisation; Planning process; resilient cities; Spatial data infrastructure; Spatial planning; Urban areas; Climate change; Climate change; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Urban planning",,,,,"Barnett, Urban Resilience, Research Prospectus (2007) A Resilience Alliance Initiative for Transitioning Urban Systems Towards Sustainable Features; Beyer, C., Wasserburger, W., (2009) Plan4all Deliverable 2.2, Analysis of Innovative Challenges; Berkes, P., Folke, C., (1998) Linking Social and Ecological Practices and Social Mechanisms for Building Resilience, , Cambridge; Cerba, O., Conceptual data models for selected themes (2010) Plan4all Deliverable 4.2; (1983) European Regional/Spatial Planning Charter, , Council of Europe; Delgado, J., Valcarcel Sanz, N., Diagnostic report (2010) HLANDATA Deliverable 1.1; Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of March 14, 2007 Establishing An Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE), , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:108:0001: 0014:EN:PDF, accessed on February 28, 2011; Fürst, D., Regionalplanung im System gesellschaftlicher Steuerung (1995) Zukunftsaufgabe Regionalplanung.

In order to ela borate a model suitable for medium-term forecasts and recommendations, we have defined eight major elements of Information Society that characterise the evolution of the corresponding digital economy. The evolution of the overall system is described by a discrete-continuous-event system, where the mutual impacts of each of the elements are represented within state-space models. Technological trends and external economic decisions form inputs, while feedback loops allow us to model the influence of technological demand on IT, R&D, production, and supply of DSS. The technological characteristics of the product line evolution modelled in this way can provide clues to software providers about future demand. They can also give R&D and educational institutions some idea on the most likely directions of develop¬ment and demand for IT professionals. As an example, we will model the evolution of decision-support systems and recommenders for 3D-internet-based e-commerce, and their impact on technological progress, consumption patterns and social behaviour. The re sults presented here have been obtained during an IS/IT foresight project carried out in Poland since 2010 and financed by the ERDF. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Decision-Support-Systems; Discrete-Event-Systems; Foresight; Information Society Technologies; Quantitative Trend Analysis; Scenarios","Discrete-Event-Systems; Foresight; Information society technologies; Scenarios; Trend analysis; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information science; Mathematical models; Three dimensional; Information technology",,,,,"Antoniou, I., Reeve, M., Stenning, V., The Information Society as a Complex System (2000) Journal of Universal Computer Science, 6 (3), pp. 272-288; Bhargava, H.K., Power, D.J., Sun, D., Progress in Web-based decision support technologies (2007) Decision Support Systems, 43 (4), pp. 1083-1095; Eom, S.B., Decision support systems research: Current state and trends (1999) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 99 (5-6), pp. 213-220; http://fistera.jrc.ec.europa.eu/, accessed 12.2010; http://www.iscom.unimo.it, accessed 12.2010; Karacapilidis, N., An Overview of Future Challenges of Decision Support Technologies (2006) Intelligent Decision-making Support Systems.

However, in most areas, including biodiversity conservation and environmental ecology, this has usually been done unsystematically. One reason for this is that issues appear unexpectedly, many of which were foreseeable with the benefit of hindsight. The failure to identify and respond appropriately to potential forthcoming issues will result in policymakers making unwise decisions. As an emerging and future-oriented technology, horizon scanning is such a powerful tool that can be used to inform the strategic decisions of companies, non-governmental and governmental organizations. It not only provides a view of key future issues and the actors involved along with their potential interactions, but also help to identify the major (scientific and political) questions that require answers in order to make strategies more robust and resilient. As a matter of fact, horizon scanning was initially utilized in engineering, computational science and medical industry. But over the past decade, together with other future-oriented methods such as foresight and technology assessment, horizon scanning has been increasingly recognized as part of forward-looking government processes in addressing the diversity of societal and environmental challenges of the future and potential emerging issues in science and technology, particularly across Europe. Horizon scanning is essentially the systematic search for incipient trends, opportunities and risks that may affect the probability of achieving management goals and objectives to inform the strategic decisions of companies, nongovernmental and governmental organizations. Since horizon scanning was introduced into ecological and related research areas in the last two years, the technology has shown tremendous application prospects in monitoring biodiversity and ecological security assessment. When performed and evaluated objectively, horizon scanning can identify the potential benefits, threats and opportunities about forthcoming issues and technological developments based on contemporary research and available evidence, thereby allowing policymakers and practitioners to establish more prudential, robust and resilient programs and strategies correlated with the dynamics of ecological environments. This consequently can help the government and organizations to make more positive responses to various ecological problems in the future, and promote their capability to respond to key emerging issues closely associated with the changes of ecological circumstances. However, in China there is a lack of relevant research or report on the application of horizon scanning technology to risk assessment of the ecological environment, biodiversity conservation and bio-security management. Through horizon scanning, researchers can then decide which issues might be of utmost importance for study, and practitioners can also use horizon scanning to ensure timely policy development and proactive research areas. In the face of increasing ecological and environmental threats at a global scale, we think that it is indispensable for Chinese ecological and research organizations to initiate horizon scanning research in four key areas: invasive species management, momentous geological disasters, environmental and ecological security and biodiversity loss, in order to mitigate serious situations and pressure on ecological environment.","Biodiversity conservation; Ecological security; Horizon scanning","biodiversity; biomonitoring; computer simulation; conservation management; nongovernmental organization; policy making; research work; state role; technological change; Europe",,,,,"Sutherland, W.J., Woodroof, H.J., The need for environmental horizon scanning (2009) Trends in Ecology and Ecology, 24 (10), pp. 523-527; Fitzherbert, E.B., Struebig, M.J., Morel, A., Danielsen, F., Brühl, C.A., Donald, P.F., Phalan, B., How will oil plan expansion affect biodiversity?

First, it applies scenario techniques to identify technology requirements, considering six different visions of the future, especially the 'circulation society', the 'environment-friendly society'and the 'equity society'. Delphi techniques are used to complete the green technology foresight with an improved questionnaire and statistical model, compared with the traditional one. It is argued that green technology foresight is the evolution and extension of traditional technology foresight, and the basic idea of foresight-guided efforts to achieve sustainability should be considered not only in China, but also in other countries and in other industries. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Automobile industry; China; Delphi; Green technology foresight; Scenario","automobile; numerical model; software; statistical analysis; sustainability; China",,,,,"Andersen, P.D., Jörgensen, B.H., Lading, L., Rasmussen, B., Sensor foresight-technology and market (2004) Technovation, 24 (4), pp. 311-320; Banñuls, V.A., Salmeron, J.L., Foresighting key areas in the information technology industry (2008) Technovation, 28 (3), pp. 103-111; Blind, K., Regulatory foresight: Methodologies and selected applications (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (4), pp. 496-516; (2008) China Automobile Industry Forecast (2006-2010), , http://www.chinamet.com/cn/bwdt/details.jsp?id=9641, Chinamet; Coates, J.F., Jarratt, J., Mapping the issues of an industry: An exercise in issue identification (1986) Long Range Planning, 20 (1), pp. 90-98; Cuhls, K., (1998) Technikvorausschau in Japan.

The texturing type was the technology division criterion. Thus, in the paper three technologies, as following: polycrystalline silicon texturisation by alkaline etching, laser treatment and laser treatment with chemical etching were compared. Design/methodology/approach: In the framework of the foresight-materials science research, a foresight matrices set was prepared, the strategic development tracks were determined, as well as materials science experiments using a Nd:YAG laser, a scanning electron microscope, a confocal laser scanning microscope and a spectrophotometer were conducted. Finally, on the basis of the obtained results the technology roadmaps were prepared. Findings: The carried out research pointed out the industrial importance of polycrystalline silicon texturisation and good perspectives for these technology groups. Research limitations/implications: Research concerning polycrystalline silicon texturisation constitute a part of a larger research project aimed at identifying, researching, and characterising the priority innovative technologies in the field of materials surface engineering. Practical implications: The presented results of experimental materials science research were proved the significant positive impact of texturisation on the structure and mechanical properties of polycrystalline silicon surface layers, which leads to the justification of their including into the set of priority innovative technologies recommended for application in industrial practice. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper is to evaluate the value of polycrystalline silicon texturisation in the background environment with their future development perspectives determination. © International OCSCO World Press.","Foresight; Manufacturing and processing; Polycrystalline silicon texturisation; Surface treatment; Technology roadmapping",,,,,,"Dreher Matvis., C., Manufacturing visions: A holistic view of the trends for European manufacturing (2007) Advanced Manufacturing.

We therefore develop a methodology for the joint shaping of thematic priorities and prospective collaborative networks. Our methodology helps identify networks that are aligned with the thematic priorities and consist of research groups with shared interests.

In an energy context that is rapidly changing on account of the exhaustion of fossil resources and the battle against global warming, it is essential to be able to envisage the agricultural sector's take - and that of its major players - on energy-related challenges. This is why the French Ministry of Agriculture's Centre d'études et de prospective launched a broad foresight study in 2009-2010 entitled, ""Agriculture Energy 2030"", the central lessons of which are reported here by Celine Laisney, Fabienne Portet and Julien Vert. After an assessment in which they specify the links between agriculture and energy in France and stress the various medium-to-long-term issues in the field, the authors outline this foresight study and the four scenarios to which it gave rise. These four contrasting scenarios, each translated into figures, describe the probable developments of French agriculture in various energy contexts up to 2030. They are termed, respectively, ""Territorialization and Energy Conservancy in the face of Crisis"", ""Dual Agriculture and Energy Realism"", ""Health-Agriculture without Strong Energy Constraints"", and ""Ecological Agriculture and Energy Management"". Highlighting the difficulties to come, but also the opportunities available to the agricultural sector, these scenarios provide the public authorities with new elements to feed into their agricultural strategy, indicate the existing scope for manoeuvre and enable general objectives and various possible levers of change to be identified, depending on the lines of action preferred.",,,,,,,"Les auteurs font tous partie du Centre d'études et de prospectiv e CEP du ministère français de l'Agriculture, de l'Alimentation, de la Pêche, de la Ruralité et de l'Aménagement du territoire MAAPRAT voir encadré infra.

Such retrospective comparisons are quite rare, if only because the forecasters and other drafters of long-term planning studies prefer to look to the future rather than the past. However, as is shown in this article by Marie-Hélène Laurent, François Cattier, Dominique Osso and Prabodh Pourouchottamin who have attempted to carry out such a retrospective analysis of foresight studies on energy demand, such comparisons have a great deal to teach us. After specifying the nature of the studies analysed (forecasts, foresight studies, projections), what they cover and the way they were elaborated (the use of a reference scenario in particular), the authors - though cautious as to the relevance of such retrospective comparisons - ask themselves three questions. First, was the study wrong and, if so, to what extent and in what direction? Then, why was it wrong? They show, for example, the various types of possible error (trajectory, trend, variability etc.) and their impact, the importance of the quality of hypotheses and of the profile of the authors involved, and the lessons that ensue. Lastly, posing the question of the seriousness of the errors found, Laurent et al. seek to put things into perspective: on the one hand, retrospective comparisons help to refine the analysis and reduce the potential risks of error in such exercises; on the other, they enable us better to grasp consumption systems dynamically, to identify the sectors in which it is most difficult to bring about change, and to refine the timescales of the measures to be implemented - the key element in all foresight studies being that the hypotheses and scenarios should be communicated with the greatest possible transparency.",,,,,,,"Chercheurs à EDF R&D, la branche Recherche- développement d'Électricité de France; Qui peuvent être très variées: joule J, kilowattheure kWh, tonne équivalent pétrole tep, British Thermal Unit BTU, short tons, long tons, etc; C'est par exemple la quantité d'énergie nécessaire à la fabrication et la commercialisation d'un véhicule on parte de consommations « du puits à la roue » ainsi qu'à la construction des infrastructures routières; TWh: térawattheure, soit un milliard de kilowattheures; TWh ef: térawattheure d'énergie finale; 1 Mtep = 11, 63 TWhef; L'intensité énergétique d'une activité ou d'une zone géographique est la quantité d'énergie nécessaire à la création d'une unité de richesse à l'échelle d'une année et pour le périmètre défini; D'autant plus que certains termes sont indifféremment utilisés pour les deux: projection projection en anglais et perspective outlook en anglais; Du Gestionnaire, R.T.E., (2009) Bilan Prévisionnel de L'íquilibre Qffrc-demandc D'éeclricité en France, p. 172. , Paris: RTE; Autres appellations possibles-. future studies, forward looking activities ou prospective studies; Ou backcasting en anglais; (2004), Scénario éncrgétiqut tendanciel à 2030 pour la France.

Innovative companies are aware of weak signals coming from the periphery and of trends in their industry, and they monitor the coherence between weak signals and trends (the external perspective) and strategic direction (the internal perspective).The literature today does not provide well-framed and complete methodologies for assessing the coherence among trends, vision and products. Therefore, the authors propose a methodology called ""the methodology of future coverage"", which measures how much the strategy oriented to the future effectively covers trends and megatrends. In other words, it helps to check the contents and the coherence of the firm' vision and products and those of the trends that will have relevance for the future of the industry, and this process supplies firms with supplementary information on how to improve. The authors tested this methodology and exemplified its use via the Eurotech case study, employing longitudinal analysis. The methodology can be useful as a tool for diagnosing the coherence between trends and company strategy. Moreover, from a dynamic point of view, it can be used as a tool to check on the company's progress in following up on trends by adapting its strategy over time. Finally, the methodology can be also used as a tool for cross-comparison of the ""level of future orientation"" among companies in the same industry. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend","Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend; Industry; corporate strategy; field method; forecasting method; future prospect; innovation; strategic approach; trend analysis",,,,,"Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1994) Competing for the Future, , Harward Business School Press, Boston; Okun, A., (1981) Prices and Quantities: A Macroeconomic Analysis, , The Brooking Institution; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , The Free Press, New York; Ansoff, H.I., The emerging paradigm of strategic behaviour (1987) Strateg.

The findings show that web quality has significantly positive effect on perceived interactivity, web usage, and web satisfaction separately, which in turn influence web loyalty. This study also confirms that perceived interactivity is an important mediator between web quality and web outcomes. This study emphasizes the importance of both web quality and perceived interactivity in the progress towards success health websites.

The doctrine of standing is surfacing in the contexts of judicial foreclosure and bankruptcy proceedings as a defense to the foreclosing party's right to foreclose. Defendants and debtors are affirmatively compelling lenders to produce evidence of ownership of the underlying note and mortgage, and lenders are increasingly falling victim to the same haste and lack of foresight that led to the crisis. Additionally, courts are beginning to raise these issues on their own, a sign that they are inclined not to allow lenders to foreclose without properly protecting the homeowners at risk. This protective stance, however, fails to reach the homeowners whose foreclosures occur outside the judicial system. Numerous defects in standing and ownership of the mortgages pass through nonjudicial foreclosure without any scrutiny, and homeowners' interests in retaining ownership of their property will continue to suffer unless legislators respond with laws requiring proof of ownership of the loan before foreclosure.",,,,,,,"http://media.oregonlive.com/frontporch/other/ RealtyTrac%20YearEnd%202009%20National%20Data%20FINAL.pdf, Press Release, RealtyTrac, RealtyTrac Year-End Report Shows Record 2.8 Million U.S. Properties with Foreclosure Filings in 2009-An Increase of 21 Percent from 2008 and 120 Percent from 2007 (Jan. 14, 2010), available at (reporting 2,824,674 foreclosure filings).

Yet, sustainability remains an elusive concept, and its nature seems unclear for the most part. In order to truly mobilize people and nations towards sustainability, we place emphasis on the necessity of understanding the nature, cost and principles of 'visioneering'-the engineering of a clear vision. In SES, purpose is the most important pillar, which gives birth to vision-the key to fulfilling the systems' mission. Such a systems perspective leads us to redefine resilience as jumping back to the original purpose, for which SES do not necessarily retain the same structures and functioning after disturbances. A sustainable future will require purpose-driven transformation of society at all scales, guided by the best foresight, with insight based on hindsight that science can provide. Visioneering with resilience-based systems thinking will provide communities with a logical framework for understanding their interconnections and purposes, envisioning a sustainable web of life, and eventually dancing with the systems. © 2011 Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science, United Nations University, and Springer.","Resilience; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability science; Systems thinking; Visioneering",,,,,,"Anthes, R.A., The global trajectory (1993) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 74 (6), pp. 1121-1130; Barabási, A.L., (2002) Linked: The New Science of Networks, , Perseus: Cambridge University Press; Berkes, F., Colding, J., Folke, C., (2003) Navigating social-ecological systems: Building resilience for complexity and change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Capra, F., (2002) The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living, , New York: Anchor Books; Chapin III, F.S., Kofinas, G.P., Folke, C., (2009) Principles of Ecosystem Stewardship: Resilience-Based Natural Resource Management in a Changing World, , Berlin: Springer; Costanza, R., A vision of the future science: reintegrating the study of human and the rest of nature (2003) Futures, 35, pp. 651-671; Daly, H.E., Sustainable growth: an impossible theorem (1993) Valuing the Earth: Economics, Ecology, Ethics, pp. 267-273. , H.

Importance of micro-scale air monitoring is rising due to the concern about environment near residential places. Traditional monitoring methods are providing overall air quality indexes. However, these methods have limited functionalities to provide air quality of near my house or where I am now. In this paper, we are trying to overcome the limitation of traditional methods by using ubiquitous sensor network (USN). AirScope consists of computational fluid dynamics based air quality modeling, USN-based sensor monitoring, and multi-modal interaction platform. We present a brief overview of AirScope and several aspects of constructed initial indoor test environment with a few validity tests. The proposed system will be extended to an outdoor real-world testbed with most of modern urban elements.

The theory connects the area of accounting regulations and the place where the result of their application is put into use, namely the capital market. Quantifying this connection is done indirectly, by using two direct connections. Firstly there is quantified the similitude degree of the considered accounting regulations based on a detailed content analysis. Secondly there is quantified to what extent the foresights of the considered accounting regulations are actually used in practice by companies being listed on the capital market. Once determined the two correlations there is derived the link between a certain capital market and a set of accounting regulations that is different from the one officially being applied by companies listed in the considered market. The proposed theory is tested by considering accounting regulations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and companies being listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), focusing on financial assets' measurement.

Almost without exception, these visions have been dashed by reality. The question therefore arises: ""To what extent or under what conditions is visioning an ideal future a worthy exercise?"" or ""Under what conditions is it useful and when is it limiting?"" In anticipating the future in general, and seeking a better future for Africa in particular, might foresight tools built on another (non-visionary) basis provide better fruit? This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The paper considers this question as it applies to scenario planning in particular, by investigating recent, contrasting case studies of scenario-building activities in Africa (Tanzania and South Africa). Findings: The paper determines the appropriate uses and limits of ""visionary"" scenario planning, and suggests a contrasting ""adaptive"" basis for scenario work. Originality/value: It is argued that maintaining the purpose-platform distinction between these two modes is fundamental to getting full value out of scenario work in general, and in the African context in particular. The contrasting case studies explain how and why the adaptive-normative distinction is important; how different purposes each demand different use of the scenario process tools that currently exist, and show why failure to fit scenario approaches to purpose greatly diminishes the efficacy of the method for either purpose. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Africa; Forecasting; Forward planning; Scenario planning; Strategic management",,,,,,"(2008) Eco-Resorts of the Future, , Arup Foresight; Kahane, A., Learning from Mont Fleur: Scenarios as a tool for discovering common ground (1993) Deeper News, 7 (1); (2011) Live the future, , www.livethefuture.co.za, available at (accessed May 2011); (2001) Global Scenarios ""People and Connections: Scenarios to 2020"", , Shell International, The Hague; Sunter, C., (1987) The World and South Africa in the 1990s, , Human & Rousseau, Tafelberg; van der Heijden, K., Bradfield, R., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Wright, G., (2002) The Sixth Sense, , Wiley & Sons, Chichester; (2009) Live the Future: HIV and AIDS Scenarios for South Africa 2005-2025 - Project Overview, , Metropolitan Foundation, Cape Town; (2009) Live the Future: HIV and AIDS Scenarios for South Africa 2005-2025 - Respond to the Challenge, , Metropolitan Foundation, Cape Town; Segal, N., (2007) Breaking the Mould: The Role of Scenarios in Shaping South Africa's Future, , Sun Press, Stellenbosch; (2003) Scenarios, An Explorer's Guide, , Shell International, The Hague","Gordon, A.; Adaptive Futures, Cardiff, United Kingdom; email: adamvgordon@gmail.com",,,,,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960650294

Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the form of a review and analyzes the current literature on foresight and philosophy of the future. Findings: The paper finds that the practical challenge of taking a ""scenaric stance"", as articulated in ""Facing the fold"", cannot be addressed without going beyond the typically epistemological solutions proposed by most futurists. Research limitations/implications: The challenge is not finding ways to ""know"" the future, rather to find ways to live and act with not-knowing the future. Practical implications: The ""scenaric stance"" points to a way of embracing what Henri Bergson calls ""the continuous creation of unforeseeable novelty."" Social implications: The ""scenaric stance"" offers one way of addressing the difficult, often deeply painful challenge of reconciling the desire for certainty with the desire to ""be free"" - in the Senian sense of capacity - by providing a way to embrace ambiguity and spontaneity. Originality/value: The emergence of new solutions to how people think about the future rather than what kind of future reflects a confluence of events in the realms of theory and practice. The reason why one needs to and can rethink how one thinks about the future is original to the present conjuncture. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complexity theory; Decision making; Philosophy; Risk management; Scenario planning; Strategy",,,,,,"Adam, B., Cultural future matters: An exploration in the spirit of Max Weber's methodological writings (2009) Time and Society, 18 (7); Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, Knowledge (Human Science for a New Era), 1. , Transaction Publishers, Piscataway, NJ, 3rd ed; Berger, G., Sciences humaines et prévision (1957) La Revue Des Deux Mondes, (3); Bergson, H., (1946) The Creative Mind, , The Greenwood Press, New York, NY; Bishop, P., Hines, A., (2007) Thinking about the Future: Guidelines for Strategic Foresight, , Social Technologies, Washington, DC; Burt, G., Chermack, T.J., Learning with scenarios: Summary and critical issues (2008) Advances in Developing Human Resources, 10 (2), pp. 285-295. , (originally published online February 22, 2008); Bussey, M., Six Shamanic concepts: Charting the between in futures work (2009) Foresight, 11 (2), pp. 29-42; Butz, M.V., Sigaud, O., Gerard, P., (2003) Anticipatory Behavior in Adaptive Learning Systems, , (Eds.), Springer, Berlin; Curry, A., Schultz, W., Roads less travelled: Different methods, different futures (2009) Journal of Future Studies, 13, pp. 35-60. , 4, May; de Jouvenel, H., (2004) An Invitation to Foresight, , Futuribles, Paris; DeLanda, M., (2006) A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity, , Continuum, New York, NY; Research, D.G., (2010) European Forward-Looking Activities: EU Research in Foresight and Forecast Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities List of Activities 2007-2010, , Directorate-General for Research, European Union, Brussels; Fuller, T., Loogma, K., Constructing futures: A social constructivist perspective on foresight methodology (2009) Futures, 41 (2), pp. 71-79; http://fumee.co.cc, FuMee 3 ""Futures meetings on the ontology of anticipatory systems"", available at, n.d; Gidley, J., Fien, J., Smith, J.-A., Thomsen, D., Smith, T., Participatory futures methods: Towards adaptability and resilience in climate-vulnerable communities (2009) Environmental Policy and Governance, 19 (6), pp. 427-440; Godet, M., Durance, P., Gerber, A., (2008) The Use and Misuse of Scenario Building, , CNAM-LIPSOR, Dunod, Paris; Gordon, T., (2009) The Delphi Method, Futures Research Methodology - 3.0, , The Millennium Project, New York, NY; Inayatullah, S., (2004) The Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) Reader: Theory and Case Studies of an Integrative and Transformative Methodology, , December,(Ed.), Tamkang University Press, Taipei; Karlsen, J.E., Overland, E.F., Karlsen, H., Sociological contributions to futures' theory building (2010) Foresight, 12 (3), pp. 59-72; Kicker, D., Wendell Bell and Oliver W.

Most people of the region are involved in agriculture or related activities from ancient times. The flora of the region is rich in grasses as well as valuable herbs. To overcome the problems of short rainfall period, and the difficult terrain that limits rainwater harvest, the local people and the successive dynasties of rulers had the foresight of developing suitable structures for rainwater harvesting, including in-situ and ex-situ strategies. In the alleviation of poverty, tackling the problems of low productivity, and in responding to the changing climate and the edaphic scenario, the region can be credited for the successful integration of pastoral economy with traditional agriculture. The region has judiciously exploited the changing climatic patterns to evolve genetic diversity in crop species, suited to the changing scenario. Culturally, the region has a rich heritage and is known for its numerous forts, palaces, and temples. Khajuraho, with a large group of medieval temples exhibiting exquisite and intricate stone sculptures, has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. For these reasons, the region is being proposed as another National Agricultural Biodiversity Heritage Site, and the present article discusses the supporting features in brief.",,"biodiversity; climate change; economic analysis; environmental degradation; genetic differentiation; grassland; harvesting; heritage conservation; rainfall; soil erosion; succession; terrain; topsoil; traditional agriculture; UNESCO; Bundelkhand; Gangetic Plain; India; Yamuna River; Poaceae",,,,,"Anjani, K., Jain, S.K., Castor (2004) Plant Genetic Resources: Oilseeds and Cash Crops, pp. 105-117. , Dhillon BS, Tyagi RK, Saxena S, Agrawal A, eds..

These datasets share the common objective of dividing European environmental gradients into convenient units, within which objects and variables of interest have relatively homogeneous characteristics. The stratifications and typologies can be used as a basis for up-scaling, for stratified random sampling of ecological resources, for the representative selection of sites for studies across the continent and for the provision of frameworks for modeling exercises and reporting at the European scale. This paper provides an overview of five recent European stratifications and typologies, constructed for contrasting objectives, and differing in spatial and thematic detail. These datasets are: the Environmental Stratification (EnS), the European Landscape Classification (LANMAP), the Spatial Regional Reference Framework (SRRF), the Agri-Environmental Zonation (SEAMzones), and the Foresight Analysis for Rural Areas Of Europe (FARO-EU) Rural Typology. For each classification the objective, background, and construction of the dataset are described, followed by a discussion of its robustness. Finally, applications of each dataset are summarized. The five stratifications and typologies presented here give an overview of different research objectives for constructing such classifications. In addition they illustrate the most up to date methods for classifying the European environment, including their limitations and challenges. As such, they provide a sound basis for describing the factors affecting the robustness of such datasets. The latter is especially relevant, since there is likely to be further interest in European environmental assessment. In addition, advances in data availability and analysis techniques, will probably lead to the construction of other typologies in the future. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Climate; Segmentation; Socio-economic factors; Soils; Stratification; Typology","data set; environmental assessment; environmental gradient; homogeneity; literature review; numerical model; research work; sampling; segmentation; socioeconomic status; soil type; spatial analysis; typology; upscaling; Europe",,,,,"Bakkestuen, V., Erikstad, L., Halvorsen, R., Step-less models for regional environmental variation in Norway (2008) Journal of Biogeography, 35, pp. 1906-1922; Bartholomé, E., Belward, A.S., GLC2000: a new approach to global land cover mapping from earth observation data (2005) Internationa Journal of Remote Sensing, 26 (9), pp. 1959-1977; Bohn, U., Gollub, G., Hettwer, C., (2000), Karte der natürlichen Vegetation Europas: Maßstab 1:2.500.000.

Among these, a scenario relating to France - the négaWatt scenario - was published in 2003, and then updated in 2006. It proposed radical change in this field, based on three main levers: energy conservation, energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources. In the early days of 2007 Futuribles called on the authors of this scenario to outline this original work in the journal, but despite contacts and follow-up efforts, some of them as part of the preparation of this special issue on energy problems, it has not proved possible to obtain an article from those responsible for the négaWatt scenario. It is, in fact, Bernard David, who has kindly agreed to pen a critical analysis of this work for Futuribles. He outlines the basic elements of the negaWatt scenario here and describes its originality but also its limitations. He highlights, in particular, various essential questions for arriving at an overall ecological assessment of the solutions advocated by négaWatt, in order to satisfy himself that they do not lead to indirect consumption or pollution likely to counterbalance the expected energy savings (this is why life-cycle analyses are so valuable). Obviously, we regret that the ""négaWatt"" Association was not able to present its work and its scenario itself, and we hope that the questions raised by Bernard David will encourage it to do so in these pages in the near future.",,,,,,,"Chargé de prospective stratégique «corporate» au CEA Commissariat a 1'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives.

Given its seriousness (the highest level on the international scale of nuclear events), the accident revived the fiercest debates between supporters and opponents of nuclear power, debates echoed by Futuribles in the ""Forum"" feature of this special issue. Without taking sides in the debate, Michel Drancourt has his say on the question, attempting to gauge the consequences of the disaster for both Japan and the world. He starts out from an article published in Futuribles more than 20 years ago (no. 136, October 1989), which laid out the conclusions of a report by the Tokai Bank on the potential economic consequences of an earthquake in Tokyo. As he stresses, the situation has changed and Japan no longer occupies the central place in financial and commercial dealings that it did in the 1980s; nevertheless, the country remains an importer and major supplier of many products, and a weakened Japan will have consequences industrially, politically and economically for the rest of the world. As for the comparison of the 1989 scenario with the 2011 reality, one of the lessons to be learned is that the scenario would not have been far wrong if the earthquake had not been accompanied by the tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident. Hence two longer-term conclusions: in foresight exercises, we should not work on the basis of a single, isolated risk; and, most importantly, sources of energy production should be diversified as greatly as possible.",,,,,,,"Économiste, membre du comité de rédaction de Futuribles; Si Tokyo tremblait...

It is certainly the case that the goals for greenhouse-gas emission reduction are rather ambitious, particularly in France, it being the aim of the 2005 French framework law on energy to reduce carbon gas discharges by a factor of four. Among these scenarios, the Négatep scenario developed by Claude Acket and Pierre Bacher from the ""Sauvons le climat"" [Let's save the climate] Association proposes to achieve this (""factor 4"") goal in France by 2050 by reducing fossil fuel use by 75% and replacing this as quickly as possible with electricity produced from non-carbon-gas-emitting sources - chiefly, nuclear power and renewables. The authors lay out their goals here, backed up by figures, comparing these with the reference scenario. They also show the path that must be followed to arrive at these goals, particularly in the residential and tertiary sectors, and in transport and industry (through control of needs and recourse to alternative energy sources). They close by comparing the Négatep scenario with two other more recent scenarios aimed also at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, on the one hand in Europe, and on the other in Germany. The comparison confirms that they were right to rely on electricity as a substitute for oil, but gives them cause for concern in respect of the consequences (formidable in their view) that the replacement of nuclear power and coal energy by intermittent renewable energies might have in Europe, both with regard to costs and to the effects on the power network.",,,,,,,"www.sauvonsleclimat.org, Membres du conseil sdentifique de l'association Sauvons le dimat site Internet; L'Européen moyen rejette aujourd'hui entre 6 et 10 tonnes de gaz carbonique par an.

However, the developmental neural underpinnings of these characteristics are not well established. Methodology/Principal Findings: To test the hypothesis that these adolescent behaviors are linked to under-developed proactive control mechanisms, the present study employed a hybrid block/event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Stroop paradigm combined with self-report questionnaires in a large sample of adolescents and adults, ranging in age from 14 to 25. Compared to adults, adolescents under-activated a set of brain regions implicated in proactive top-down control across task blocks comprised of difficult and easy trials. Moreover, the magnitude of lateral prefrontal activity in adolescents predicted self-report measures of impulse control, foresight, and resistance to peer pressure. Consistent with reactive compensatory mechanisms to reduced proactive control, older adolescents exhibited elevated transient activity in regions implicated in response-related interference resolution. Conclusions/Significance: Collectively, these results suggest that maturation of cognitive control may be partly mediated by earlier development of neural systems supporting reactive control and delayed development of systems supporting proactive control. Importantly, the development of these mechanisms is associated with cognitive control in real-life behaviors. © 2011 Andrews-Hanna et al.

As our numbers and appetites grow, food supplies become less secure, reserves of clean energy dwindle, pools of freshwater evaporate, the atmosphere's capacity to absorb our emissions diminishes and space for human and biotic habitat grows scarce. In response, some are now asking whether the biosphere can support our growing herds of domesticated livestock, notably ruminants. My aim in this review is to contemplate the place of these animals in a world in need of re-greening, in more ways than one. In addressing this objective, I advance the premise that the place of livestock is examined best from the vantage of 'land', broadly defined. Livestock have been implicated in many injurious processes: land use change, excess water use, nutrient excretion, fossil energy use, competition for food and emission of greenhouse gases. At the same time, they offer numerous benefits: producing food from human inedible sources, preserving ecosystem services, promoting perennials on croplands, recycling plant nutrients and providing social benefits. Thus livestock can be both stressors and benefactors to land and the aim of researchers should be to shift the net effect from stress to beneficence. To advance this goal, I offer seven questions, seen through the lenses of 'systems', 'place', 'time' and 'community', mostly to foster discourse. How do we better study whole systems? How do we better tune the systems to local land? How can we know long term consequences? How do we measure progress? How do we choose among trade-offs? How do we engage society? What will (or should) our successors' livestock systems look like? Humans and their livestock are intertwined to such an extent that their symbiosis will not likely soon be severed. Livestock offer many benefits to human society and often their place in ecosystems can be ecologically justified. But that does not mean that all ways of raising them are beneficial, nor that they necessarily fit everywhere. In coming decades, researchers, in concert with practitioners, consumers and policymakers, will need to show creativity, foresight and courage to envision new ways of melding animals into our ecosystems, not only to minimize harm, but to advance their re-greening.This paper is part of the special issue entitled: Greenhouse Gases in Animal Agriculture - Finding a Balance between Food and Emissions, Guest Edited by T.A.

We identify three well established perspectives that address uncertainties in strategic decisions: an adaptive perspective, focusing on an incremental adaptation of existing structures as a reaction to unforeseen developments, a modeling perspective, focusing on an improved characterization of future context conditions and a managerial perspective, focusing on increasing the flexibility of the infrastructure organization. Despite their virtues, these approaches have definite weaknesses in their approach to uncertainty: they often consider a restricted scope of alternatives, they face substantial difficulties in predicting context conditions over time periods of decades and often consider objectives and tradeoffs only implicitly. We elaborate and illustrate with a case study a fourth perspective that may compensate for these specific weaknesses and complement the established strategic planning approaches. This perspective is based on a discursive, qualitative assessment of key elements in the strategic planning process among a selected set of local stakeholders and decision makers. We maintain that this approach leads to a more explicit and reflexive treatment of future uncertainty, conflicting objectives and a broadening of the considered alternatives and therefore to a more robust decisionmaking process. © IWA Publishing 2011.","Foresight; Public participation; Strategic planning; Water sector infrastructure",,,,,,"Achleitner, S., Moderl, M., Rauch, W., CITY DRAIN © - An open source approach for simulation of integrated urban drainage systems (2007) Environmental Modelling and Software, 22 (8), pp. 1184-1195. , DOI 10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.06.013, PII S136481520600171X; Armstrong, M., Sappington, D.E.M., Regulation, competition and liberalization (2006) Journal of Economic Literature, 44 (2), pp. 325-366; Aubin, D., Varone, F., Policies regulating the water supply and sanitation sector in nine European countries (2007) Water and Liberalisation: European Water Scenarios, Finger, , M., Allouche, J. & Luís-Manso, P.

His main arguments are based on: (i) The disease-blood concept, i.e., the idea that blood can be unclean (with an either excess or bad-quality humor) and thus cause a disease; (ii) Cure can be achieved if elimination (catharsis in Greek) of the humor (toxin) is possible; (iii) If the toxins are limited in the intravascular space, their elimination will be sufficient for cure by just a single attempt of replacing the unclean blood with pure; (iv) If the toxins have also affected the extravascular space, then repeated attempts will be needed; (v) The whole procedure can be compared with the insufficiency of washing once a dirty clay pot and immediately filling it with a pure liquid. The dirt that has adhered to the pot's walls will contaminate the pure liquid. Thus, repeated washing is needed to achieve cleanness. Galen's metaphor of washing a dirty pot for a long period and eventually achieving a pure content is strikingly similar to the theory of hemodialysis. According to this, uremic toxins are spread both intravascularly and extravascularly. To eliminate them, long and repeated ""washing"" of the blood is needed. One of the reasons the first attempts to dialyze failed was that this ""washing"" procedure was inadequate (the other reasons were clotting of the blood, infections and access problems). © 2011 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.","Bloodletting; Catharsis; Dialysis; Galen; Hippocrates; Purification","uremic toxin; acute disease; article; chronic disease; circulation; dialysis; extravascular space; hemodialysis; history of medicine; human; intoxication; intravascular space; medical literature; phlebotomy; purification; uremia; vascular access; Bloodletting; Dialysis; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Renal Dialysis; Toxins, Biological",,"Toxins, Biological",,,"Drukker, W., History of haemodialysis (1989) Replacement of renal function by dialysis, p. 21. , In: Maher J, ed., Dordrecht: Kluwer; Cameron, J.S., (2003) A history of the treatment of renal failure by dialysis, p. 2. , Padstow: Oxford University Press; Diamantopoulos, A., Goudas, P., Substitution of renal function through skin catharsis: Evidence from the classical period to the Middle Ages (2001) Kidney Int., 59, pp. 1580-1589; Diamandopoulos, A., Goudas, P., Oreopoulos, D., Thirty-six Hippocratic aphorisms of nephrologic interest (2009) AJKD., 54, pp. 143-153; Aphorismi (1962) Oeuvres completes d'Hippocrate, , Hippocrates, In: Littre E., ed., Amsterdam: Hakkert; De flatibus (1962) Oeuvres completes d'Hippocrate, , Hippocrates, In: Littre E., Amsterdam: Hakkert, section 6, lines 8-11; Diamandopoulos, A.A., A history of natural membranes in dialysis (1997) Am J Nephrol., 17, pp. 304-314; Diamandopoulos, A.A., Goudas, P., Diamandopoulos, A.H., The human skin: A meeting ground for the ideas about macrocosm and microcosm in ancient and Medieval and Greek literature (2001) Vesalius., 7, pp. 94-101; Galen, Adversus ea quae a Juliano in Hippocratis aphorismos enuntiata sunt libellus (1951) Galeni adversus Lycum et adversus Iulianum libelli, 18 A, pp. 282-283. , In: Wenkebach E, ed., Berlin: Akademie-Verlag; Crombie, A.C., (1994) Styles of scientific thinking in the European tradition, 1, pp. 94-217. , London: Duckworth G; Galen, (1968) De usu Partium, 3, p. 368. , Helmreich G, ed.

The growth of Foresight and Futures Studies as a discipline has been less robust than the internal logic of the field would predict, potentially indicating an opportunity for theoretical renewal. Foresight is often justified on managerial grounds, with the argument that a discipline is needed to guide decision-making in a technologically aggressive, post-industrial society. Some within Foresight and Futures Studies have argued for the active development of alternatives to these managerial justifications. However, the links between Strategic Management and Futures Studies are robust and the embrace of cross-disciplinary dialogue has proven invigorating in some other disciplines. An evaluation of the goals and logic of Foresight from the standpoint of mainstream Strategic Management gives a novel perspective on the field, highlighting its importance to information processing. Finally, Foresight speaks to well-established normative problems with short-term biases in managerial contexts. For the purposes of this article, the terms ""Foresight"" and ""Futures Studies"" are used interchangeably to refer to the general study of futures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"decision making; future prospect; information processing; management; strategic approach; theoretical study",,,,,"Coyle, G., The nature and value of futures studies or do futures have a future?

Many security foresight studies foresee increasing economic and politico-military regionalization. The power blocks that may emerge from this are said to make the world increasingly multi-polar. In security foresights two scenarios in particular emerge. In the most common scenario, Russia under Putin searches and obtains more political, military and economic growth and power. Security foresights give, generally speaking, little attention to the European Union, and the prospects they give are diffuse. Very often growth is foreseen in geographic breadth as well as institutionally in depth. A trend with regard to developments on failing states is absent. In security foresights, however, two different schools of thought exist on this issue.

More than 20 experts participated in the STEEP-V brainstorming sessions having affiliations with R & D organizations, Ministry of Water and Power, researchers and professors in universities, NGO and private sector organizations. STEEPV which is an acronym for (Social, Technological, Environmental, Economic, Political and Values) is an internationally recognized tool for brainstorming used in conducting Technology Foresight worldwide. Most of the experts focused on indigenous solutions for meeting future energy requirements rather than importing the technologies. The main focus was on the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency/conservation. Greater emphasis in this regard was on energy education and ensuring support and incentives for research and development in the energy sector.","Awareness.

Passive Optical Networking (PON) is suitable for eliminating bandwidth insufficiency, so national governments and communities are observing the emergence of Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) technologies. Ethernet-based Passive Optical Networks (EPON) and Gigabit-based PON (GPON) are two candidates for next-generation PON in bandwidth efficiency. To predict which is more suitable nationally, we define a foresight framework based on hybrid Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods for selecting the most suitable PON. The development of next-generation PON, including Ethernet PON (EPON) and Gigabit PON (GPON), is introduced and compared. Experts from industry and academia were invited to predict the most suitable next-generation PON for Japan and emerging economies such as Taiwan. Results showed that EPON is most suitable for Japan and GPON most suitable for Taiwan. Results for the technological foresight can serve as the basis for national telecommunication policy and business product definition.","Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM); Networking; Technology foresight; Telecommunications",,,,,,"(2008) Telecommunications Development Fund Technical Assistance, Universal Access Program Manual of Operating Procedures, , ASTRO Systems Inc; Kim, K.S., On the evolution of PON-based FTTH solutions (2003) Information Sciences, 149 (1-3), pp. 21-30. , DOI 10.1016/S0020-0255(02)00241-4, PII S0020025502002414; Shareholder risks associated with the National Broadband Network, , http://www.actu.org.au/Images/Dynamic/attachments/6205/ NBNRiskPaperFinalVersion.pdf, ACTU, (Online) Available; Townsend, P.D., Talli, G., Chow, C.W., MacHale, E.M., Antony, C., Davey, R., Ridder, T.D., Rohde, H., Long reach passive optical networks (2007) The IEEE LEOS Annual Meeting; Sherif, S.R., Hadjiantonis, A., Ellinas, G., Assi, C., Ali, M.A., A novel decentralized Ethernet-based PON access architecture for provisioning differentiated QoS (2004) J. of Lightwave Technology, 22, pp. 2483-2497; Skubic, B., Chen, J., Ahmed, J., Wosinska, L., Mukherjee, B., A comparison of dynamic bandwidth allocation for EPON, GPON, and next-generation TDM PON (2009) IEEE Communication Magazine, 47, pp. S40-S48; Georghiou, L., The UK technology foresight programme (1996) Futures, 28, pp. 359-377; Martin, B.R., Johnston, R., Technology foresight for wiring up the national innovation system: Experiences in Britain, Australia, and New Zealand (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 60 (1), pp. 37-54. , DOI 10.1016/S0040-1625(98)00022-5, PII S0040162598000225; Abernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Innovation: Mapping the winds of creative destruction (1985) Research Policy, 14, pp. 3-22; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , New York, N.Y., Free Press; Antunes, A., Canongia, C., Technological foresight and technological scanning for identifying priorities and opportunities: The biotechnology and health sector (2006) Foresight, 8 (5), pp. 31-44. , DOI 10.1108/14636680610703072; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes-New participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) J. of Forecasting, 22, pp. 93-111; Huang, C.-Y., Tzeng, G.-H., Multiple generation product life cycle predictions using a novel two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis method (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75 (1), pp. 12-31. , DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2007.07.005, PII S0040162507001473; Pai, P.-F., Hong, W.-C., Lin, C.-S., Forecasting electric load by support vector machines with genetic algorithms (2005) J. of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics, 9, pp. 134-141; Pasila, F., Palit, A.K., Thiele, G., Neuro-fuzzy approaches for forecasting electrical load using additional moving average window data filter on takagi-sugeno type miso networks (2008) J. of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics, 12, pp. 361-369; Huang, C.-Y., Tzeng, G.-H., Chan, C.-C., Wu, H.-C., Semiconductor market fluctuation indicators and rules derivations by using the rough set theory (2009) Int.

On the other hand many social communities (nations, regions, local municipalities) use the corporate methodology for strategic planning. The aims of the paper are twofold. It intends to give a new interpretation of strategy, which is much closer to social foresight. Here - on the basis of futures studies - path dependency and path creation can be linked and appear as two sides of the same coin. Second, on the basis of a new interpretation of strategy the paper looks at path dependency and path creation as two pillars of strategic activity and gives a dialectic understanding of the concepts.","Foresight; Futures studies; Path creation; Path dependency; Strategic development",,,,,,"Alvarez, S., Barney, J., Discovery and creation: alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strategic Entreprenurship Journal, 1 (1-2), pp. 11-26; Berghout, F., Hertin, J., (2002) Foresight futures scenarios: Developing and applying a participative strategic planning tool, , Greenleaf Publishing: Seffield; Bishop, P., Framework forecasting: Managing uncertainty and influencing the future (2005) The Second Prague Workshop on Futures Studies Methodology, pp. 94-109. , Martin Potucek & Barbora Slintakova (Eds.), Praha, TX: CESES FSV UK; Csányi, V., (1988) Evolúciós rendszerek.

In so doing, however, backcasting may run the risk of obscuring significant differences in current lived experience, negating alternative problem framings and normatively derived views of what constitutes sustainability. This paper reports an innovative UK attempt to develop an inclusive 'bottom-up' community foresight process for urban sustainability research. Unlike most backcasting studies, the methodology was initially grounded in an exploration of the community participants' current lived experience and understandings of sustainability. Given the particular purpose of the study the primary outcome from the work was structured around the articulation of a 'community-led' agenda for urban sustainability research, rather than an explicit normative vision and transition pathway. However, the methodology could easily be adapted for use in other contexts, and showed potential to contribute to the formation of local 'transition arenas': facilitating network formation and building capacity for local sustainability initiatives and experiments. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Citizens' science; Community foresight; Transition management; Up-stream engagement; Urban sustainability","Citizens' science; Community foresight; Transition management; Up-stream engagement; Urban sustainability; Electric grounding; Engineering research; Sustainable development; bottom-up approach; capacity building; forecasting method; local participation; planning process; social change; sustainability; urban society",,,,,"Kemp, R., Loorbach, D., Transition Management: A Reflexive Governance Approach (2006) Reflexive Governance for Sustainable Development, pp. 103-130. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, Glos, J.-P.

The global population is now 6.8 billion and is estimated to reach over 9 billion by 2050. Not only is the world's population expanding but it is also undergoing rapid development, and with this comes increasing demand for protein rich foods, especially meat and dairy products. As economies strengthen, the so-called diseases of affluence are often found alongside chronic malnutrition, in India for example, making the public health challenges particularly complex. The Foresight report concludes that, without change, food production will continue to degrade the environment and compromise the world's capacity to produce sufficient food in a sustainable way, as well as contributing to climate change and destruction of biodiversity. The report also emphasises that the use of new technologies as a partial solution, such as genetic modification and livestock cloning, should not be excluded a priori on ethical and moral grounds. But the question remains 'what should be done in terms of dietary advice?' This paper considers some of the issues. © 2011 The Author.

The coating type was adopted as the criterion for technology division, thus obtaining eight technology groups for carried out research. Design/methodology/approach: In the framework of foresight-materials science research: a group of matrices characterising technology strategic position was created, materials science experiments using high-class specialised equipment were conducted and technology roadmaps were prepared. Findings: High potential and attractiveness were shown of the analysed technologies against the environment, as well as a promising improvement of mechanical and functional properties as a result of covering with the PVD/CVD coatings. Research limitations/implications: Research pertaining to covering sintered tool materials with the PVD/CVD coatings is part of a bigger research project aimed at selecting, researching and characterizing priority innovative material surface engineering technologies. Practical implications: The presented results of experimental materials science research prove the significant positive impact of covering with the PVD/CVD coatings on the structure and mechanical properties of sintered tool materials, which leads to the justification of their including into the set of priority innovative technologies recommended for application in industrial practice. Originality/value: The advantage of the article are results of comparative analysis of sintered tools materials with different types of coatings deposited in the PVD/CVD processes together with the recommended strategies of conduct, strategic development tracks and roadmaps of these technologies. © Copyright by International OCSCO World Press.","Foresight; Manufacturing and processing; Sintered tool materials; Technology roadmapping; Thin and thick coatings",,,,,,"(2003) The Future of Manufacturing In Europe 2015-2020, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrialtechnologies/pdf/pro-futman-doc3a.pdf, 3The Challenge for Sustainability; Materials; Final Report; Groupe CM International; Dreher, M.C., (2007) Manufacturing Visions, , A holistic view of the trends for European manufacturing, in, M.

By using this order as a great contrast to that of modernity, he carries out a radical critique of modern ""progress"" based on increasing destruction of nature by technology. He regards such progress as catastrophic and calls for a messianic caesura of it by invoking both Judaism and Marxism.

In the Foresight Project on Mental Capital and Wellbeing (MCW), initiated by the Government Office for Science, adolescent behaviour was identified as one of the key challenges for UK policy. The report draws on 'state of the art' evidence from scientific experts, to recommend ways in which to 'capitalize' on mental faculties to improve, boost, and make maximum use of the cognitive resources and mental health of individuals during the entire lifespan. Specifically, through a close analysis of the category of adolescence in cognitive neuroscience, we examine the perspective of personhood espoused by MCW. We show how the notion of 'plasticity', which underpins the recommendations about how to ""make the most"" of adolescents' developing brains and cognitive resources, creates vital linkages between neuroscience and neosocial policy.

We measure conservatism using approaches developed in Penman and Zhang, The Accounting Review 77:237-264, (2002) and Beaver and Ryan, Journal of Accounting Research 38:127-148, (2000) and value relevance using (1) adjusted R2 from regressions of price on earnings and book values, (2) adjusted R2 from regressions of returns on earnings and changes in earnings, and (3) returns earned by perfect foresight of earnings and book values. We find no evidence that firms with increasing conservatism exhibit greater declines in value relevance. Rather, we observe most significant declines in value relevance for firms where conservatism has not increased. When we adjust financial statements for the effects of conservatism, we find that the value relevance of adjusted numbers is generally lower and trends in value relevance unaffected. Based on these results, it is implausible that increasing conservatism drives the decline in value relevance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Book value; Conservatism; Value relevance",,,,,,"Barth, M.E., Beaver, W.H., Landsman, W., The relevance of value relevance research for financial accounting standard setting: Another view (2001) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 31, pp. 77-104; Basu, S., The conservatism principle and the asymmetric timeliness of earnings (1997) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 24, pp. 3-37; Beaver, W., Ryan, S., Biases and lags in book value and their effects on the ability of the book-to-market ratio to predict book return on equity (2000) Journal of Accounting Research, 38, pp. 127-148; Beaver, W., Ryan, S., Conditional and unconditional conservatism in accounting: Concepts and modeling (2005) Review of Accounting Studies, 10, pp. 269-309; Blair, M., Wallman, S., (2001) The growing intangibles reporting discrepancy from unseen wealth: Report of the Brookings task force on intangibles; Bliss, J.H., (1924) Management through Accounts, , New York, NY: The Ronald Press Co; Brown, S., Lo, K., Lys, T., Use of R2 in accounting research: Measuring changes in value relevance over the last four decades (1999) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 28, pp. 83-116; Collins, D., Maydew, E., Weiss, I., Changes in the value relevance of earnings and book values over the past 40 years (1997) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 24, pp. 39-68; Core, J., Guay, W., van Buskirk, A., Market valuations in the new economy: An investigation of what has changed (2003) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 34, pp. 43-67; Dontoh, A., Radhakrishnan, S., Ronen, J., The declining value-relevance of accounting information and non-information-based trading: An empirical analysis (2004) Contemporary Accounting Research, 21, pp. 795-812; Easton, P., Harris, T., Earnings as an explanatory variable for returns (1991) Journal of Accounting Research, 29, pp. 19-36; Elliott, R., Jacobsen, P., U.

This governmentalisation produces powerful incentives to conform to the rulebound and institutionalised knowledge practices that institutions, government departments, corporations, and NGOs understand as being capable of telling truths about young people and about risk. I argue that knowledge practices in the social sciences should trouble what counts as truth, as evidence, and the ways in which these truths can be produced. These interests will be examined through a discussion of the ways in which Tim Winton's novel Breath can be read as an allegorical tale about the terror of being ordinary: and of the teenage years as being a time in a life in which the fear of being ordinary compels Winton's key characters to seek out, sometimes stumble upon that which promises to make their's a life less ordinary. Here risk is something that breathes energy and purpose into lifeworlds that are dominated by the institutionalised ordinariness of family, school, and work. As an allegorical tale told from the vantage point of hindsight, Breath unsettles what it is that the social sciences can tell us about youth (as becoming) and risk (as mitigated by prudential foresight). © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Allegory; Breath; Knowledge practices; Social scientific imagination; Youth at-risk",,,,,,"Batten, M., Russell, J., (1995) Students At Risk: A Review of Australian Literature 1980-1994, , Camberwell, VIC: The Australian Council for Educational Research; Bauman, Z., (1997) Postmodernity and Its Discontents, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid Modernity, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2003) Liquid Love: On the Frailty of Human Bonds, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2005) Liquid Life, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2006) Liquid Times: Living In An Age of Uncertainty, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2007) Consuming Life, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2008) Does Ethics Have a Chance In a World of Consumers?, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bauman, Z., (2008) The Art of Life, , Cambridge: Polity; Beck, U., (1992) The Risk Society, , Cambridge: Polity; Binkley, S., Capetillo, J., (2009) A Foucault For the 21st Century: Governmentality, Biopolitics and Discipline In the New Millennium, , Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Cambridge Scholars; Bratich, J.Z., (2003) Foucault, Cultural Studies, and Governmentality, , New York, NY: State University of New York Press; Brookes, F., (2009) Exploring the Tweenie Self: A Reflexive Ethnography of the Obviously Ordinary, , Paper presented at The Australian Sociology Association annual conference, 2-4 December, Canberra; Burchell, G., Liberal government and techniques of the self (1996) Foucault and Political Reason: Liberalism, Neo-liberalism and Rationalities of Government, pp. 19-36. , In: A.

Method: Cross-sectional study by means of the International Classification of Functionality (ICF). 109 adults with spinal cord injury in the city of Curitiba, Brazil were evaluated. Results: The categories most compromised in body were intestines and bladder, sexuality, energy, sleep, emotion and weight. In the domain activities and participation, there was greater difficulty in tasks of bathing, toilet and dressing, self care and leisure. In the domain environmental factors, the categories classified as facilitators were: medications, orthoses and wheelchair, attitude of family, transport, social foresight and health services. The categories classified as barriers were: attitude of authorities, social attitudes, education and work.

A stability definition reflects a decision maker's behavior in a conflict or game, predicts how the game is played, and suggests the resolutions or equilibria of the dispute. Various stability definitions, reflecting different types of people with different levels of foresight, risk attitude, and knowledge of opponents' preferences, have been proposed for resolving games. This paper reviews and illustrates six stability definitions, applicable to finite strategy strategic non-cooperative water resources games, including Nash Stability, General Metarationality (GMR), Symmetric Metarationality (SMR), Sequential Stability (SEQ), Limited-Move Stability, and Non-Myopic Stability. The introduced stability definitions are applied to an interesting and highly informative range of generic water resources games to show how analytical results vary based on the applied stability definitions. The paper suggests that game theoretic models can better simulate real conflicts if the applied stability definitions better reflect characteristics of the players. When there is a lack of information about the types of decision makers, the employment of a range of stability definitions might improve the strategic results and provide useful insights into the basic framework of the conflict and its resolution. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conflict resolution; Game theory; Non-cooperative behavior; Policy; Solution concepts; Stability definitions; Strategic game; Water resources management","Conflict Resolution; Non-cooperative behavior; Policy; Solution concepts; Strategic game; Water resources management; Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision theory; Game theory; Stability; Water resources; decision making; game theory; planning method; stability analysis; strategic approach; water management; water resource",,,,,"Amit, R.K., Ramachandran, P., A fair contract for managing water scarcity (2009) Water Resour Manag, 24 (6), pp. 1195-1209. , doi:10.1007/s11269-009-9491-5; Brams, S.J., Wittman, D., Nonmyopic equilibria in 2 × 2 games (1981) Confl Manage Peace Sci, 6 (1), pp. 39-62; Bryant, J., (2003) The Six Dilemmas of Collaboration: Inter-Organizational Relationships as Drama, , Chichester: Wiley; Camerer, C.F., Strategizing in the brain (2003) Science, 300, pp. 1673-1675; Costa-Gomes, M., Crawford, V.P., Broseta, B., Cognition and behavior in normal form games: an experimental study (2001) Econometrica, 69 (5), pp. 1193-1235; Dinar, A., Howitt, R.E., Mechanisms for allocation of environmental control cost: empirical tests of acceptability and stability (1997) J Environ Manag, 49, pp. 183-203; Dinar, A., Wolf, A., Economic potential and political considerations of regional water trade: the Western Middle East example (1994) Resour Energy Econ, 16, pp. 335-356; Dinar, A., Ratner, A., Yaron, D., Evaluating cooperative game theory in water resources (1992) Theory Decis, 32, pp. 1-20; Elimam, L., Rheinheimer, D., Connell, C., Madani, K., An ancient struggle: a game theory approach to resolving the Nile conflict (2008) Proceeding of the 2008 world environmental and water resources congress, pp. 1-10. , In: Babcock RW, Walton R (eds), American Society of Civil Engineers.

A methodological framework for participatory backcasting is presented, after which a conceptual framework is developed to describe and evaluate the impact of backcasting experiments. Three cases are analysed: (1) Novel Protein Foods and meat alternatives; (2) Sustainable Household Nutrition; and (3) Multiple Sustainable Land-use in rural areas. The cases show that participatory backcasting can lead to substantial follow-up and spin-off, but that is not always the case. Substantial follow-up and spin-off after five to ten years is predominantly found at the level of niches, and can be seen as potential seeds for future system innovations. The emergence of follow-up and spin-off comes along with the diffusion of the visions generated in the backcasting experiment. The visions provide orientation (where to go) and guidance (what to do). Visions also show both stability and flexibility. Factors that influence the extent of impact and spin-off of backcasting are identified, with a focus on stakeholders, learning and visions. Finally, relevance for system innovation theory, governance and policy as well as research recommendations are briefly discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Future vision; Learning; Participatory backcasting; Socio-technical transitions; Stakeholders; Sustainability foresight; System innovation","Backcasting; Future vision; Learning; Sociotechnical; Stakeholders; Sustainability foresight; System innovation; Experiments; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Innovation; innovation; learning; participatory approach; stakeholder; sustainability; Netherlands",,,,,"Elzen, B., Geels, F.W., Green, K., (2004) System innovation and the transition to sustainability, , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham UK/Northampton MA; Rotmans, J., Kemp, R., van Asselt, M., More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy (2001) Foresight, 3, pp. 15-31; Quist, J., (2007) Backcasting for a sustainable future: the impact after ten years, , Eburon, Delft NL; Loorbach, D., (2007) Transition Management: a New Mode of Governance for Sustainable Development, , International Books, Utrecht NL; (2008) System Innovation for Sustainability 1: Perspectives on Radical Changes to Sustainable Consumption and Production, , Greenleaf Publishers, Sheffield UK, A.

This concept is the base of the established system of innovation policy. However, a new type of innovation is becoming increasingly widespread — innovation initiated by the user. Such developments are often not based on R&D and technology. Despite the increase in the area of statistical innovation measurement in recent years, the role of the user as an player in innovation is underestimated, both in statistical and political terms. The paper attempts to explain the specifics of this phenomenon and evaluate its contribution to economic development. The emerging new model presumes a changing role of technologies — from innovation drivers to innovation enablers. It is emphasized that the dynamics of user innovation should not be underestimated, as they create the prerequisites for involving the whole society in the innovation activity. This allows the enlargement of the share of warranted innovations owing to issuing products demanded by users; increasing market niches; developing collaborative models; and changing policy priorities. Implementation of new opportunities provided by “mass” innovation depends on the innovative capacities of users and the possibilities of their mobilization under public and corporate policy. Empirically, the study is based on the results of the 1st round of Monitoring the innovation behavior of the Russian population evaluating Russian users' innovation capabilities. It demonstrates that better access to ICT for the majority of the population may significantly increase the population’s innovation potential and bear fruits in the short and middle-term perspective. The analysis confirms the necessity of government efforts in developing innovation infrastructure. It is obvious that user-oriented policy does not exclude fostering manufacturers but presumes use of complementary leveraging for establishing long-term economic growth, based on active inclusion of the mass population into innovative processes.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper contextualises and synthesizes the set of Africa-themed foresight papers included in the journal issue. Findings – The exploration concludes that Africa faces a range of internal and external opportunities and challenges. These are historical, geopolitical, economic, demographic, psychological, and intellectual. Key drivers and analyses identified by seven authors are briefly presented. Research limitations/implications – The restricted number of papers that could be included in the single issue required a narrow selection from a large set of good papers and subject coverage. The issue and editorial therefore only address a few of the key drivers, in addition to some broad, foundational issues. Practical implications – Neither mere optimism nor pessimism will determine Africa's ultimate trajectory. Concerted ownership, foresight and collective action by Africa's leaders and followers are the key to positive futures for the continent. Originality/value – The Special Issue is a unique contemporary African foresight contribution, which aims to provide a deeper understanding of the emerging challenges and opportunities for the continent. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Africa; Economic development; Emerging markets",,,,,,"Maathai, W., (2009) The Challenge for Africa: A New Vision, , Pantheon, New York, NY; Meredith, M., (2005) The Fate of Africa: From The Hopes of Freedom To The Heart of Despair, , Public Affairs, New York, NY; (2011) Africa's Future and the World Bank's Support to It, February, Africa Region, , The World Bank, Washington, DC; (1991) Human Development Report 1991, , United Nations Development Programme, New York, NY",,,,,,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957882620

But few people carefully consider this issue, especially, while the 3C firms would expand their business field in developing the electrical/electronic (E/E) technology based vehicle products, which are against more rigorous specifications to the automotive industry. Hence, from the quality aspect, this paper proposes an analytical mechanism (i.e., stage-gate analyzer) to help the formulation process of strategy-making. We illustrate the strategic quality aspect across several management levels. We also apply an example in Telematics to demonstarte how to ensure process reengineering's consistency on the ongoing NPD process with APQP requested. Despite a lot of large 3C enterprises in Taiwan are running the requested now, both strategy and execution need company-wide common recognition and efforts. We find that a strong linkage between strategy-makers and executors would significantly reduce the deviation in identifying business vision and operational process, and then assist to improve their great foresight with consistent actions toward a business goal.","Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP); Emergent strategy making; Stage-gate analyzer; Telematics","Advanced product quality planning; Business goals; Business vision; Common recognition; Emergent strategy making; Formulation process; Management level; Operational process; Process reengineering; Quality aspects; Technology-based; Telematics; Product development; Quality control; Reengineering; Automotive industry",,,,,"Bobrek, M., Sokovic, M., Implementation of APQP-concept in design of QMS (2005) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 162-163, pp. 718-724; Carmeli, A., Schaubroeck, J., Top management team behavioral integration, decision quality, and organizational decline (2006) The Leadership Quarterly, 17 (5), pp. 441-453; Chen, C.P., Chien, C.F., What constitutes 'a quality decision'?

For these projects the question arises, whether one of the scenarios became reality or not in each case. The answer is: Yes, except a few. We reviewed the quality of 19 scenario projects. Three times we missed the point, i.e. none of the developed scenarios occurred. That motivates us to get to the bottom of this.

The analysis takes into account significant changes in the conceptualization of virtual worlds that have led to overcome their status as distinct social technological environments, where practices take place isolated from the physical setting. The increased transparency of mediations, which traditionally have placed limits on the immersion and interaction between people and virtual objects, implies that they occupy a secondary place as a key element in the definitions of virtual worlds. Based on this consideration, the article analyzed the other components that support the social layer of virtual worlds and provides them with a high educational potential. Among other aspects of formation, the article explores the ability of technological mediation, immersion and social presence, non-physical materiality or practice that is itself part of a virtual world so defined. Finally, the need to design appropriate educational theories and hybrid scenarios that result from the interactions in-out of physical reality is discussed.","3D learning scenarios; Cyberspace; Educational theory; Expanded learning; Virtual identity; Virtual worlds",,,,,,"Biocca, F., The cyborg's dilemma: Progressive embodiment in virtual environments (1997) Journal of ComputerMediated Communication, 3, p. 2. , http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/120837728/main.html, ftx_abs?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0, Consultado el 18.V. 2010; Blythe, M., Pastiche scenarios (2004) Interactions, 11 (5), pp. 51-53; Bowman, D.A., Mcmahan, R.P., Virtual reality: How much immersion is enough?

Here, a method to quantify, over extended timescales, the effectiveness of non-structural measures such as land use spatial planning, insurance and flood resilient construction is presented. The integrated approach couples socio-economic and climate change scenarios with long term land use modelling and flood risk analysis to generate maps and time series of expected annual damages. The analysis has been applied on a case study in the Thames Estuary in the UK. Stakeholders helped develop a number of scenarios that might lead to substantial changes in existing planning and insurance policies in the UK. The effectiveness of these changes was analysed and showed the substantial benefits in terms of reduction of future flood risks that are achievable with changes in planning policy, financial incentives and resilient property construction in the floodplain. Moreover, the reward can be increased through earlier action. Subsequently, the benefits of a range of policies are explored under the UK Foresight socio-economic scenarios. Different structural and non structural flood management interventions are tested and the results demonstrate that despite the potential for large increases in flood risk in the Thames Estuary, in all scenarios substantial flood risk reductions are possible. The effectiveness of non-structural measures is however sensitive to socio-economic changes and governance arrangements. The analysis described here will help to identify portfolios of non-structural and structural options that are robust to uncertainties. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Flooding; Insurance; Non-structural measures; Planning; Risk analysis","construction method; embankment; environmental change; flood control; flood damage; incentive; insurance industry; land use planning; policy approach; risk assessment; socioeconomic conditions; stakeholder; time series; uncertainty analysis; England; Thames Estuary; United Kingdom",,,,,"(2002) ABI Statement of Principles on the Provision of Flood Cover, , Association of British Insurers, London; (2008) ABI Revised Statement of Principles on the Provision of Flood Insurance, , http://www.abi.org.uk/Publications/Revised_Statement_of_Principles_on_the_Provision_of_Flood_Insurance1.aspx, Association of British Insurers, London; Browne, M.J., Hoyt, R.E., The demand for flood insurance: empirical evidence (2000) Journal of Risk and Uncertainties, 20 (3), p. 16; Burby, R.J., Bollens, S.A., Holloway, J.M., Kaiser, E.J., Mullan, D., Sheaffer, J.R., (1988) Cities Under Water: A Comparative Evaluation of Ten Cities' Effort to Manage Floodplain Land Use, 47. , Program on Environment, Technology & Man, Institute of Behavioral Science, University of Colorado, Boulder; Burgess, K., Townend, I., The impact of climate change upon coastal defence structures (2004) Proc. 39th DEFRA Flood and Coastal Defence Conference; (2008) Cabinet Office The Pitt Review-Lessons Learned from the 2007 Floods, , HMSO, London; (2006) CLG Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk, , Communities and Local Government, UK; Dahlström, K., Salmonds, R., (2005) Building Economic and Social Information for Examining the Effects of Climate Change (BESEECH): Final Report, , Policy Studies Institute, London; Dawson, R.J., Hall, J.W., Probabilistic condition characterisation of coastal structures using imprecise information (2003) Proc. 28th Int.

Constructing Futures: industry leaders and futures thinking in construction takes a thematic approach to the future of the UK construction industry by presenting the results of a series of in-depth interviews conducted with leading construction figures and structuring this material into chapters addressing the key contemporary issues in the industry. These high-profile figures are drawn from a wide range of stakeholder groups representing the realities of construction, including architects, client organisations (public-sector and private-sector), consultants, contractors, developers, lobby groups with special interests, policy makers, professional institutions, and trade unions. A total of 15 influential figures were interviewed for the book, from Sir Michael Latham and Bob White to Wayne Hemmingway and Kevin McCloud. Part One looks to the past by reviewing a series of foresight studies undertaken of the construction industry and re-presenting stories of our interviewees' lives to explain the development of leadership in the context of the construction industry. In Part Two, the authors look at the present and discuss two fundamental issues: sustainable development and governance of the construction industry. In Part Three the book concludes with an afterthought for the future, highlighting key lessons learnt putting forward a series of research questions derived from this scholarly reflection of 'futures thinking' in construction. Throughout, the authors juxtapose the views of the 15 influential figures interviewed with a review of the salient points found in the relevant and authoritative sources of theoretical literature, both in the mainstream literature and the field of construction management. This allows the reader to benefit from the practical insights of those interviews whilst gaining a rapid understanding of the key debates of the theoretical subject under scrutiny. © 2011 Paul Chan and Rachel Cooper.",,,,,,,"Grossman, L., Forward thinking (2004), pp. 46-52. , In: Time magazine, 25 October; Murray, M., Langford, D., Construction reports: 1944-98 (2003), Edited text.

Design/methodology/approach – Counterfactual analysis, scenario analysis and peripheral vision are presented as the constituting methodological triad through which scenario thinking comes into representation. Findings – Scenario thinking is a temporally emerging everyday organizational practice. By placing emphasis on the mundane and taken for granted activities that come together to form the nexus of the practice, often deep underlying structures of organizational behaviour contributing to scenario thinking can be theorised. Research limitations/implications – The practice conceptualisation of scenario thinking inverts and challenges existing management and practitioners' conventional understanding of the practice as an episodic phenomenon in waiting to be facilitated by an expert with specific end points and conformity. Practical implications – Foresight practitioners and researchers can use this as an analytical starting point for the study and theorising of scenario thinking in self organized groups.

One of these is the health and longevity of human life. Amongst applications anticipated to provide a solution to this challenge, gene therapy appears to be particularly promising. In theory, many diseases that result from genetic disorders can be cured by correcting defective genes. In practice, finding efficient and safe delivery vectors remains the stumbling point on the path of genetic therapies to the clinic. Viruses, otherwise the most efficient transfectors, pose safety concerns over immune reactions, whereas synthetic gene packages greatly lack the structural integrity of viruses. An ideal vector is therefore seen as a compromise between the two: a nanoscale device, which would mimic a virus and act as a virus, but would do this at the designer's whim. A strategy to achieve this is offered by the virus architecture itself, the principles of which are translated into the function via exquisitely reproducible self-assembly mechanisms. Thus, to mimic a virus is to mimic the way it is built, i.e., self-assembly. With just a few attempts made so far, the journey to an artificial virus has had a short lifetime, but the promise it holds is not expected to reduce any time soon. Novel biomaterials capable of delivering macromolecular cargo into the cell are of considerable interest in gene therapy and drug delivery. Viruses may present best candidates; however, safety issues challenge their use. A saving solution is seen in viral mimetics. This article puts particular stress on the compatibility of such systems with the viral assembly - arguably the shortest route to an artificial virus. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Design/methodology/approach: An evolutionary perspective is deployed to specify the presumed relationship between managerial foresight and firm performance measures. A positive relationship between managerial foresight and firm performance is proposed. The hypothesis is tested through Spearman's rho, on Swedish managers, and firms in the computer programming industry. Managers' foresight as well as performance is assessed as indexes. Findings: The paper finds a moderate and statistically significant positive relationship between managers' foresight and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: There is support for the theoretical relationship between managerial foresight and firm performance. There is a strong rationale for further studies. Originality/value: The paper provides empirical evidence regarding the importance of managerial foresight for firm performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Company performance; Forward planning;

Design/methodology/approach: The model of assessment is based on an integrated framework characterized by approaching foresight as a project and associating it by the redefined pitfalls in, and success factors of, corporate foresight projects in order to facilitate better conversion of their results into actual changes in corporations. A multinational company in Turkey (Siemens Turkey) is chosen for the exploratory case study. The exploratory assessment model was designed via the use of a survey questionnaire, a case study, and interviews of managers (who were involved in the corporate foresight project). Findings: Results of the individual assessment of corporate foresight project at the company were labeled as ""successful"". There needs to be given an overall attention to the process-oriented elements of the foresight project. Pitfalls in the foundation phase accumulated the highest problem area, suggesting that the total project would eventually suffer. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of the study is the use of a single case with an attempt to assess the pitfalls of the foresight projects. The exploratory study may include premature conclusions about the assessment of corporate foresight project results, yet a single case can imply generalizable insights. The authors believe this research suggests some potentially significant insights for foresight studies and their applications. Practical implications: The study may help to support the reliability of the foresight studies as they have been implemented and might bring a new methodological challenge on the quality and success of the corporate foresight project results. Social implications: The approach described the factors affecting the success of corporate foresight activities with respect to understanding the pitfalls of foresight projects. Taking reference to such a framework, foresight results may be better delivered and disseminated in corporations with concrete results and actual changes in organizations. The model of assessment may be used to analyze the level of the reported success of foresight project results in companies implementing foresight activities. Originality/value: Although foresight studies within businesses has become more important and widespread with its systematic and continuous/participatory approach, based on a variety of methods, it is still a partially explored area in terms of research with mainly descriptive studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Assessment; Corporate strategy; Forward planning; Project evaluation; Turkey",,,,,,"Alsan, A., Corporate foresight in emerging markets: Action research at a multinational company in Turkey (2008) Futures, 40 (1), pp. 47-55; Andersen, E., Grude, K.V., Haug, T., (1996) Goal Directed Project Management, , Coopers & Lybrand, London, 2nd ed; Andersen, E.S., Jessen, S.A., Project maturity in organizations (2003) International Journal of Project Management, 21, pp. 457-461; Becker, P., (2002) Corporate foresight: A first overview, , working paper; Chetty, S., The case study method for research in small-and medium-sized firms (1996) International Small Business Journal, 15 (1), pp. 73-85; Cuhls, K., Grupp, H., (2003) Status and Prospects of Technology Foresight in Germany after Ten Years, , www.e-innovation.org/stratinc/str_intel_articles.html, available at: (accessed January 25, 2010), Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research; Eisenhardt, K.M., Building theories from case study research (1989) The Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Göl, S., (2008) An exploratory study on the effects of femininity/masculinity, happiness, space/time perspectives of iindividuals on assessment of megatrends and corporate foresight project results, , PhD thesis, Institute of Social Sciences, Yeditepe University Istanbul, February; Göl, S., Öner, M.A., Operationalization of space/time perspectives of individuals - theory and empirical results from Turkey (2009) Futures, 41 (5), pp. 301-312; Irvine, J., Martin, B., (1984) Foresight in Science: Picking the Winners, , Pinter, London; Müller, A., (2006) Strategic foresight in companies: An international survey on trends and futures research processes, , www.strategicforesight.ch, unpublished paper, available at: (accessed August 28, 2007); Neef, A., Daheim, C., (2005) Corporate foresight: The European experience, paper prepared for WFS Conference, Chicago, July 2005, , www.z-punkt.de/fileadmin/be_user/englisch/D_Downloads/2005_WFS.pdf, (accessed January 25, 2010); Öner, M.A., Göl, S., Pitfalls in and success factors of corporate foresight projects (2007) International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy, 3 (4), pp. 447-471; Saunders, M., Lewis, P., Thornhill, A., (2003) Research Methods for Business Students, , Prentice-Hall, Harlow, 3rd ed; Schwarz, J.O., Pitfalls in implementing a strategic early warning system (2005) Foresight, 7 (4), pp. 22-30; Schwarz, J.O., Assessing the future of futures studies in management (2008) Futures, 40 (3), pp. 237-246; Stake, R.E., (1995) The Art of Case Study Research, , Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, CA; Stewart, W., Balanced scorecard for projects (2001) Project Management Journal, 32 (1), pp. 38-53; Thiry, M., For DAD: A programme management life-cycle process (2004) International Journal of Project Management, 22 (3), pp. 245-252; (2005) Technology Foresight Manual I, , www.unido.org/foresight/registration/dokums_raw/volume1_unido_tf_manual.pdf, UNIDO, available at: (accessed January 25, 2010), UNIDO, Vienna; (2005) Technology Foresight Manual II, , www.unido.org/foresight/registration/dokums_raw/volume2_unido_tf_manual.pdf, UNIDO, available at: (accessed January 25, 2010), UNIDO, Vienna; Yin, R.K., (2003) Case Study Research: Design and Methods, , Sage Publications, Newbury Park, CA, 3rd ed; Lynch, D., Kordis, P.L., (1988) Strategy of the Dolphin: Scoring a Win in a Chaotic World, pp. 141-166. , Fawcett Columbine, New York, NY; Meadows, D.H., Meadows, D.H., Randers, J., Behrends III, W.W., (1972) The Limits to Growth, , Earth Island, London","Beşer, S.

The paper addresses recent developments in Foresight theory and practice which allow for deploying a hybrid methodological framework where different approaches serve different purposes in specific phases in order to tailor Foresight to a wide range of different contexts and objectives. The paper can be characterised as empirically based theory building. The theoretical framework is elaborated by applying it in two R&I fields: (i) GM plants and (ii) Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies. Hence, this research is expected to contribute improving the strategic processes of priority setting in techno-institutional arenas both on the national and international level. In particular it is suggested that the capability of Foresight to function as a systemic innovation policy instrument for enhancing innovation and learning capability could be improved substantially by tailoring the Foresight approach to the targeted innovation arena. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"innovation; research; strategic approach; theoretical study",,,,,"Bonaccorsi, A., Search Regimes and the Industrial Dynamics of Science (2008) Minerva, 46 (3), pp. 285-315; (2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, , Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd., Cheltenham, UK; Northampton, MA, USA, L.

The intention is that such a primer can be easily reproduced into a format suitable and portable for managers to consult when in project meetings to design foresight processes and select methods. Design/methodology/approach: Using a matrix table plus some text analysis and diagrams, a concise review of the dominant and most innovative tools for framing technology foresight processes is developed and summarized. Findings: The paper produces 13 foresight methods classified, summarized and referenced with a limited selection of literature references. Practical implications: The intention is that the main table and diagrams can be easily copied to a standard poster or made into a pocket pamphlet for those who wish to carry the primer with them.

It seeks to show an evolution away from a traditional focus on broad-based technological priority setting to a much more focussed and adapted set of applications. The inherent limitations of prioritisation processes are discussed. The more limited aim of articulating specific fields is noted. Recent trends in research and innovation policy have opened new opportunities for the application of foresight. Systemic and demand-side policies require a shared vision on the part of purchasers and suppliers. The role of foresight in such contexts needs both to be enhanced and better understood. An increasing structural focus for foresight exercises is associated not only with broader R&I system reform but also with an engagement with new-wave innovation policies. The success of demand-side measures such as cluster policies and the use of procurement or regulation to stimulate innovation is dependent upon the formation of a common vision between the supply and demand sides, opening the possibility for the application of foresight approaches. We note the emergence of a combination of corrective, disruptive and creative roles. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"demand-side management; innovation; policy making; reform process; research; strategic approach",,,,,"Technology Futures Analysis Methods Working Group Technology futures analysis: toward integration of the field and new methods (2004) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 71 (3), pp. 287-303; Kuwahara, T., Cuhls, K., Georghiou, L., Foresight in Japan (2007) The Handbook of Technology Foresight: Concepts and Practice, pp. 170-183. , Elgar, Cheltenham, L.

The objective is to generate concrete benefits for prospective strategic management in the academic sector. It also aims to focus on how it may be possible for universities to address the challenges of major change management programmes by implementing foresight and intellectual capital management models. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews recent literature both on conceptual issues and experiences in relation to foresight and intellectual capital. The paper presents an ongoing project focused on the development of a vision for the future of the higher education system in Romania and a frame to differentiate Romanian universities. Findings: A proposal of an integrated use of foresight and intellectual capital management for universities is suggested. The case study presented illustrates how foresight provides an excellent approach to address the question of how to develop a shared vision of the future and jointly define a strategy to best adapt an organization to the new context, and intellectual capital management models play a role in strategic management, resource allocation and monitoring of objectives and organization performance. Practical implications: The issues addressed in the paper could provide the starting point for better integration of strategic management in higher education institutions.

The paper aims to identify main areas where foresight is needed as well as the constraints that it faces. It also aims to provide some prescriptions and recommendations for improving both system and process. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is based on case studies and literature search on futures/forecasting. Furthermore, analysis and observations are based on the author's own participation in different governmental and research environments; in several academic circles; within ""think tanks"" and on the international circuit (mostly at the UN, NATO, IAEA, IIASA and OECD) as well as within the Scandinavian scene. Findings: Several methodologies and techniques that are identified here may allow people to help perceive, evaluate and control the effects of their actions, present as well as future. However, they have, so far, only been used spasmodically. One reason for this state of affairs is that the difference between ""well-structured"" (normal) and ""ill-structured"" (futures type)problems has not been properly identified or satisfactorily solved. The political system faces three major problems: the problem of competence; the problem of deliverability; and the problem of legitimacy. All of these can be helped by the understanding and application of proper foresight methods and techniques. Originality/value: From the design/methodology point of view, this paper draws on the combined sources of international practice and theoretical implications. Its findings are easily comprehended and hence useful for their practical application for decision making on global as well as regional problems. The concept of fully ""learning to unlearn"" is of primary importance, as well as that of not ""discounting the future"", for which several methods and techniques have been analyzed and suggested. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Forward planning; Government; Politics",,,,,,"Ackoff, R., (1974) Redesigning the Future: A Systems Approach to Societal Problems, , Wiley Publishers, New York, NY; Coates, J.F., Foresight in federal government policymaking (1985) Futures Research Quarterly, 1 (2), pp. 29-53; Gaivoronskaia, G., Solem, K.E., Genetic testing: Affected parties and decision making (2004) Journal of Risk Research, 7 (5), pp. 481-493; Kaplan, R., The coming anarchy (1994) Atlantic Monthly, 273 (2), pp. 44-76. , February; Kaplan, R., Anarchy at sea (2009) The International Herald Tribune, (April 14), p. 8; Kaye, G.D., Solem, K.E., Decision making for global problems (1992) Futures, the Journal of Forecasting, Planning and Policy, 24 (1), p. 64; Kobayashi, Y., (2003) Future mission of Japanese think tanks and NIRA summary of policy brief for Chief Cabinet Secretary, , www.nira.go/jp/newse/panel/chairman.html; (1977) Future Research: New Directions, , Linstone, H., Simmons, C.

The role of an outcome's initial surprise in the hindsight bias was examined using animations of automobile accidents. Twenty-six participants rated the initial surprise of accidents' occurring in eight animations. An additional 84 participants viewed these animations in one of two conditions: Half stopped the animations when they were certain an accident would occur (i. e., in foresight), and the other half watched the entire animations first and then stopped the animations when they thought that a naïve viewer would be certain that an accident would occur (i. e., in hindsight). When the accidents were low in initial surprise, there were no foresight-hindsight differences; when initial surprise was medium, there was a hindsight bias; and when initial surprise was high, there was a reversed hindsight bias. The results are consistent with a sense-making model of hindsight bias. © 2011 Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Animations; Foreseeability; Hindsight bias; Judgment; Sense-making; Surprise","article; decision making; human; psychological aspect; time; traffic accident; videorecording; Accidents, Traffic; Humans; Judgment; Time Factors; Video Recording",,,,,"Ash, I.K., Surprise, memory, and retrospective judgment making: Testing cognitive reconstruction theories of the hindsight bias effect (2009) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 35, pp. 916-933. , doi:10.1037/a0015504; Bernstein, D.M., Atance, C., Loftus, G.R., Meltzoff, A., We saw it all along: Visual hindsight bias in children and adults (2004) Psychological Science, 15, pp. 264-267. , doi:10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00663.x; Bernstein, D.M., Harley, E.M., Fluency misattribution and visual hindsight bias (2007) Memory, 15, pp. 548-560. , doi:10.1080/09658210701390701; Blank, H., Nestler, S., von Collani, G., Fischer, V., How many hindsight biases are there?

Significant amounts are invested globally to address this issue, although funding fluctuates from year to year. One response to this situation is to position the construction industry with advanced technological solutions. However, the construction industry is renowned for low levels of innovation and the South African government has also underfunded research into infrastructure. There is a need to stimulate innovation in the construction industry to develop the uniquely South African technological solutions required to provide and maintain economic and social infrastructure. An investment in construction innovation should be based on a review of the current state of construction technology and the industry and an analysis of the drivers and trends that will shape the future construction industry landscape. Technology foresight studies are recognised as one way to determine the future factors that will influence a specific economic sector. This article describes a new approach to conducting a technology foresight study within the South African construction industry. The methodology, as well as initial results from it, is reported. A review is provided of the current state of the construction industry and its potential drivers and trends. Future work will include scenario development and the development of pathways and interventions to take the industry forward from its current position to a desired future state.","Construction drivers; Construction sector; Research and development; Technology foresight","Construction innovation; Construction sector; Construction technologies; Economic sectors; Globalisation; Low level; Positioning technologies; Research and development; Scenario development; Social infrastructure; South African government; Technological solution; Technology foresight; Construction industry; Innovation; Investments; Technology; Economic and social effects",,,,,"(2002) Industry As A Partner for Sustainable Development: Construction, , CICA.

Box 5003, 1432 Ås, Norway","The forest sector faces changing political paradigms and volatile policy measures. Policy makers rely on economic and biological models to inform them of the impacts and risks associated with both anticipated and unforeseen policies or shocks to the system. Assumptions about agents' knowledge of future events are fundamental in all forms of models suggesting that the degree of information of future events may have large behavioral impacts. Despite the importance of this assumption, few studies have looked into what this difference in information may imply, and few studies have analyzed the importance of varying the degree of a priori information on the impacts of policy measures. This paper attempts to elucidate some of these impacts by comparing how an exogenous shock affects the Norwegian forest sector if the agents are assumed to have: (i) perfect information, (ii) information about the market shift only a limited time before its implementation or (iii) no a priori information. The shock analyzed is an import ban on all coniferous wood into Norway, which is possible if the Pinewood nematode (PWN) becomes more widespread in Europe. To examine this question, we adapt the Norwegian forest sector model NorFor to reflect perfect, limited and no prior information. The results indicate that if the agents anticipate the shock, they will begin to adjust harvest and production levels before it occurs. Due to high opportunity costs, harvest is reduced in the first periods to allow increases later. Bioenergy, with much lower profit than pulp and paper on the margin, is the hardest hit by the ban, while paper production is little affected. This may also be due to high capital costs in the paper industry and a perfectly elastic wood demand curve for bioenergy use. Substantial price increases for both raw materials and final products are suggested under either limited or perfect foresight. The analysis may provide useful insight about how agents react to sudden changes depending on their a priori information. © 2011 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umeå, Sweden.","A priori information; Forest sector modeling; Limited foresight; Optimization; Perfect foresight","Bio-energy; Biological models; Capital costs; Forest sector model; Forest sectors; Limited foresight; Opportunity costs; Paper industries; Paper production; Perfect foresight; Policy makers; Policy measures; Price increase; Prior information; Priori information; Production level; Pulp and paper; Sudden change; Wood demand; Paper and pulp industry; Profitability; Optimization; bioenergy; coniferous tree; forest product; forestry modeling; forestry production; harvesting; optimization; policy approach; timber industry; wood; Forestry; Optimization; Paper Industry; Profitability; Pulp Industry; Norway",,,,,"Adams, D.M., Haynes, R.W., Methodological considerations in developing the timber assessment projection system (2007) Resource and Market Projections for Forest Policy Development: Twenty-five Years of Experience with the U.S. RPA Timber Assessment, p. 589. , Springer Science+Business Media, Dordrecht (Chapter 2), D.M.

We discuss their relation to specific use practices and user experiences, and provide some early ethical reflections and design concerns.","Design; Human factors; Theory","Empirical data; Ethical considerations; Future designs; Human factors; Robot designs; Robotic design; Shedding light; Theory; User experience; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Machine design; Man machine systems; Philosophical aspects; Human robot interaction",,,,,"Bell, G., Dourish, P., Yesterday's tomorrows: Note on ubiquitous computing's dominant vision (2006) Journal of Personal and Ubiquitous Computing; Fernaeus, Y., Jacobsson, M., Ljungblad, S., Holmquist, L.E., Are we living in a robot cargo cult?

Using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, we investigate the finite sample behaviour of standard tests of the expectations hypothesis (EH) of the term structure, when interest rates are increasingly persistent. We document bias for the 'perfect foresight spread' regression and find that the variance bound statistic strongly tends to favour the EH when persistence is high. In a vector autoregression (VAR) framework, the Wald test and the slope of the ordinary least squares test using the 'VAR-theoretical spread' are strongly biased.

What are the shaping forces, or sources of change and what might be their impacts, particularly where these may create entirely new challenges and opportunities? Futures experts (attendees of the FTA 2008 Conference) were invited to state their opinions on these questions by considering the trends, drivers, wilds cards, discontinuities and weak signals likely to shape the future through the Big Picture Survey. The survey was launched 6 months prior to the Conference. More than 250 responses were submitted by the Conference date. The results collected were synthesised and presented back to the attendees in a plenary presentation by the authors. The current paper aims to clarify the concepts first by suggesting definitions and discussing the distinctions between them. The paper then presents the rationales of conducting the Big Picture Survey (BPS), presents its methodology and discusses the results of the survey in a greater extent. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"survey; twenty first century; Canada; United Kingdom",,,,,"van Rij V.

To accomplish this, the brain requires large amounts of energy, and this energy is obtained by the oxidation of glucose (Glc). However, the question of how the oxidation of Glc by individual neurons in brain results in their collective ability to rapidly generate feats of cognition that allow them to recognize the nature of the universe in which they live and to communicate this information remains unclear. In this article, insights into this process are provided by first considering the brain' s homeostatic ""operating system"" for supply of energy to stimulated neurons, and how this system defines the basic unit of brain ""structure"". This is followed by consideration of the brain's ""two-cell"" neuronal communication mechanism which defines the basic unit of brain ""function"". Finally, an analysis of the nature of frequency-encoded ""neuronal languages"" that enable ensembles of neurons to translate energy derived from the oxidation of Glc into a collective ""mind"", the aggregate of all brain processes including those involving perception, thought, insight, foresight, imagination and behavior. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biosemiosis; Brain; Codes; Mind; NAA; NAAG; Neurons; Semiosis",,,,,,"Agre, P., King, L.S., Yasui, M., Guggino, W.B., Ottersen, O.P., Fujiyoshi, Y., Engel, A., Neilsen, S., Aquaporin water channels-from atomic structure to clinical medicine (2002) Journal De Physiologie, 542, pp. 3-16; Ai, H., Rybak, J., Menzel, R., Itoh, T., Response characteristics of vibration-sensitive interneurons related to Johnston's organ in the honeybee, Apis mellifera (2009) Journal of Comparative Neurology, 515, pp. 145-160; Anand, B.K., Chhina, G.S., Sharma, K.N., Dua, S., Singh, B., Activity of single neurons in the hypothamic feeding centers: effect of glucose (1964) The American Journal of Physiology, 207, pp. 1146-1154; Andrew, R.D., Labron, M.W., Boehnke, S.E., Carnduff, L., Kirov, S.A., Physiological evidence that pyramidal neurons lack functional water channels (2007) Cerebral Cortex, 17, pp. 787-802; Barbieri, M., The code model of semiosis: the first steps toward a scientific biosemiotics (2008) American Journal of Semiotics, 24 (1-3), pp. 23-37; Barbieri, M., A short history of biosemiotics (2009) Biosemiotics, 2, pp. 221-245; Barbieri, M., Three types of semiosis (2009) Biosemiotics, 2, pp. 19-30; Baslow, M.H., Memory and enzyme induction (1963) Science, 139, pp. 1091-1095; Baslow, M.H., (1969) Marine Pharmacology.

The purpose of the study is to examine how domain experts look at the practice of foresight in general, and perceive its overall impact on policy making in particular, in the setting of Japanese foresight conducted in the past 15. years. There are two tasks for doing that in this study: to know the views of scientists and engineers who participated in foresights on the impact of foresights they participated; and to know the effect of respondent's characteristics on their perceptions on impact.There are two main findings of this study. First, the impact on policy making perceived by domain experts who participated in foresight activities in Japan is not very high. Second, there are different patterns of perception on the size of the impact on policy making depending on ages, organizations, member status during foresight, and science and technology areas, and habit of following the situation in general looking for any impacts after the foresight. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi method; Foresight; Impact; Perception; Policy making; Survey","Delphi method; Foresight; Impact; Perception; Policy making; Surveys; Decision making; Delphi analysis; forecasting method; perception; policy making; science and technology; survey; Japan",,,,,"Technology futures analysis: toward integration of the field and new methods (2004) Technol.

Past researches have typically used SA to attain foresight into future issues that focus on a short-term time frame. Nevertheless, SA implies some weaknesses in that it is unable to define the transition between time states clearly and it cannot meaningfully explain how to forecast long-term uncertainty effectively and how to link present and future situations. Based on these weaknesses, we established a Markov SA (MASA) model that integrates the concept of vision, linking analysis planning, Markov chain, and SA so that we can improve the existing model for SA. The MASA model not only solves our insufficient information problem for a complete SA model but also classifies four categories for forecasting future events. The four categories that can confirm a future trend are (1) state of constancy, (2) state of disappearance, (3) state of change, and (4) state of uncertainty. This paper introduces the principles and application of the MASA model. A sample case study is given to explain how the MASA model can be applied.

In line with EFI's foresight activities, an internal exercise was done anticipating future developments in the forest sector in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region until 2020.",,"Eastern Europe; Electronic newsletters; Forest sectors; In-line; Mountain forests; Agriculture; Electronic publishing",,,,,,"Wolfslehner, B.; EFICEECAustria",,,,,,,,12367850,,EFNEF,,"English","EFI News",Short Survey,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953128379

For fisheries and aquaculture, 33 SPs exist at the state level and 7 at the national level, 1 of them for tilapia. The objective of this study is to carry out a foresight analysis (FA) of 4 tilapia SPs in Mexico-for the States of Colima, Sonora, Tabasco and Yucatán-analyzing their 2018 vision for the development of the tilapia chain. FA provides an integral vision of both the internal and external environments, identifying the key factors for each SP and helping to develop the best strategies in order to compete successfully. Sonora, Tabasco and Yucatán identify marketing aspects as key elements for their 10-year future: adding value to the product by means of new processing technologies, developing their own brand, and identifying and differentiating their product based on sanitary issues. Colima focuses its industry future success on efficiency improvements. Finally, the main technological disruptions identified by the 4 states are the incremental use of information technology, product and process certification, new hatcheries with genetically-improved fry, and new processing methodologies developed and/or applied. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight analysis; Scenarios; Supply chain; Tilapia","4-state; Best strategy; Efficiency improvement; External environments; Federal governments; Foresight analysis; Key elements; Key factors; Marketing aspects; Me-xico; National level; Processing technologies; Scenarios; Tilapia; Competition; Information technology; Supply chain management; Supply chains; competitiveness; fish; forecasting method; marketing; national trade; processing; product development; strategic approach; Colima; Mexico [North America]; Sonora; Tabasco; Yucatan; Tilapia",,,,,"FAO, Análisis de Políticas Agropecuarias y Rurales Integración de Cadenas Agroalimentarias (2004) Desarrollo de la Competitividad en Cadenas Agroalimentarias, Report of the Food and Agriculture Organization, México, D.F, pp. 1-79; Restrepo-Rivillas, C.A., Isaza-Castro, J.G., Acosta-Niño, C.I., (2005) Competitividad y estructura de la economía Colombiana, , Departamento de Publicaciones de la Universidad Externado de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia; Beltrán, A., Torres, E., Camargo, R., Bello-Pérez, C., (2004) Pymes.

This investment focused on infrastructure and skills needs of the higher education sector, and was intended to develop innovative competence and Ireland's attractiveness to foreign industry. In this context an increasing policy concern of government has been to promote effective cross-sectoral research collaboration. Policy responses have been to establish collaborative research, programs to fund industry-directed research, and on-campus facilities to foster interactions. The experience suggests that increasing overall R&D funding does not result in more technology for industry, nor in more academic interest in collaboration.

His contributions to surgical stapling, the nonoperative management of intussusception in infants and children, and the operative treatments of congenital chest wall deformities and of sphincter preservation in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, have significantly changed the landscapes of these respective areas of surgery. His advocacy was highly instrumental in the development of the field of pediatric surgery as a subspecialty.

Sales of biologic drugs reached $120 billion in 2008 [1] and the worldwide market of biologics continues to grow (IMS Health). As patents on first generation of biologic drugs, including epoetin, insulin granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interferon alpha, will soon expire, if they have not already, and patents on some of the second generation of biological drugs, such as antibody drugs, are going to be expire in the next few years, there exists a great opportunity in developing biosimilars, especially for large pharmaceutical companies which face great challenges in developing new blockbuster drugs. In the past few years, the United States, Canada, and Japan have debated or passed legislation on biosimilars with active involvement from top pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. The successful leader in this field will be the one that has the foresight and resources to position themselves well to gain in the future. So what are biosimilars? What are the technological differences between biosimilars and small molecule generic drugs? Finally, what are the considerations for biosimilars in terms of patent searching?

It promises to deliver drugs directly to the source of the disease, i.e. tumor. This article examines the literature surrounding ethics associated with nanomedicine, and asks whether these ethical issues are new and unique. While opinions differ, this review concludes that none of the ethical questions surrounding nanomedicine are new or unique, and would hold true for any new medical device or medicine that was being evaluated. The real issue becomes public acceptance of nanomedicine and how much risk society is willing to accept with a new technology before it is proven effective and 'safe'. While ethical foresight can prove effective in forecasting potential problems, in reality, ethics may not be capable of evaluating such a technology that has yet proven effective in all it has promised.

This study focuses on long distance freight transport (LDFT) and explores possible sustainable futures through quantitative modeling. The evaluation was part of European foresight process between researchers, policy makers and freight companies (FREIGHTVISION). Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy demand of road, rail and inland waterways were estimated for an EU-27 in 2005. Development was extrapolated to 2050 based on technology and freight performance forecasts. Stakeholders found the forecasted GHG emissions and fossil fuel share unsustainable, so alternative futures were developed with backcasting. The developed emission model was run with random parameter combinations to screen a set of sustainable futures, with an 80% reduction of GHG emissions and fossil fuel share. Freight transport performance was not controlled in the backcasts, but several sustainable futures were found if significant changes in transport efficiency and energy mix are implemented. In spite of agreeing on the importance of reducing emissions, stakeholders had difficulties in choosing a preferred technological future. Simple models were found to be an effective tool for communicating the influence of various measures. Further research is recommended to screen preferable technological roadmaps from the broad range of available futures. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Fossil fuel share; Greenhouse gas emissions; Model","Backcasting; Effective tool; Emission model; Energy demands; Energy mix; Freight companies; Freight transport; Freight transport systems; GHG emission; Long distances; Policy makers; Quantitative modeling; Random parameters; Road-maps; Transport efficiency; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Freight transportation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Inland waterways; Gas emissions; computer simulation; emission control; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; freight transport; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; numerical model; quantitative analysis; railway transport; road transport; sustainability; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; waterway transport; Europe",,,,,"Anders, N., Knaack, F., Rommerskirchen, S., (2009), Socio-demographic and economic megatrends in Europe and in the World.

Behavioral and neurobiological analysis of this construct, with evidence from both animal and human studies, defines several dissociable forms depending on distinct cortico-striatal substrates. One form of impulsivity depends on the temporal discounting of reward, another on motor or response disinhibition. Impulsivity is commonly associated with addiction to drugs from different pharmacological classes, but its causal role in human addiction is unclear. We characterize in neurobehavioral and neurochemical terms a rodent model of impulsivity based on premature responding in an attentional task. Evidence is surveyed that high impulsivity on this task precedes the escalation subsequently of cocaine self-administration behavior, and also a tendency toward compulsive cocaine-seeking and to relapse. These results indicate that the vulnerability to stimulant addiction may depend on an impulsivity endophenotype. Implications of these findings for the etiology, development, and treatment of drug addiction are considered. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,"behavior; brain cortex; cocaine dependence; cognition; compulsion; corpus striatum; drug dependence; drug seeking behavior; human; impulsiveness; motor performance; neurobiology; neurochemistry; neuromodulation; neuropathology; neuropsychological test; nonhuman; phenotype; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; response time; review; reward; selective attention; self report; Animals; Choice Behavior; Cognition; Compulsive Behavior; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Neuropsychological Tests; Reward",,,,,"Ahmed, S.H., Koob, G.F., Long-lasting increase in the set point for cocaine self-administration after escalation in rats (1999) Psychopharmacology (Berl.), 146, pp. 303-312; Ainslie, G., Specious reward: a behavioral theory of impulsiveness and impulse control (1975) Psychol.

In African countries, however, agriculture has been widely assumed to have performed badly. Foresight commissioned analyses of 40 projects and programmes in 20 countries where sustainable intensification has been developed during the 1990s-2000s. The cases included crop improvements, agroforestry and soil conservation, conservation agriculture, integrated pest management, horticulture, livestock and fodder crops, aquaculture and novel policies and partnerships. By early 2010, these projects had documented benefits for 10.39 million farmers and their families and improvements on approximately 12.75 million ha. Food outputs by sustainable intensification have been multiplicative - by which yields per hectare have increased by combining the use of new and improved varieties and new agronomic-agroecological management (crop yields rose on average by 2.13-fold), and additive - by which diversification has resulted in the emergence of a range of new crops, livestock or fish that added to the existing staples or vegetables already being cultivated. The challenge is now to spread effective processes and lessons to many more millions of generally small farmers and pastoralists across the whole continent. These projects had seven common lessons for scaling up and spreading: (i) science and farmer inputs into technologies and practices that combine crops-animals with agroecological and agronomic management; (ii) creation of novel social infrastructure that builds trust among individuals and agencies; (iii) improvement of farmer knowledge and capacity through the use of farmer field schools and modern information and communication technologies; (iv) engagement with the private sector for supply of goods and services; (v) a focus on women's educational, microfinance and agricultural technology needs; (vi) ensuring the availability of microfinance and rural banking; and (vii) ensuring public sector support for agriculture.

The sector is to be examined as a part of a larger study that aims to reflect on the potential future roles for the public research institutes, in several sectors (the other sectors in the study included civil space, plant science, geosurveys, and marine), towards the development of the European Research Area (ERA). Design/methodology/approach – The paper illustrates how scenario methods were used to, first, serve as a basis for policy recommendations for the field of European metrology research institutes and, second, help experts and stakeholders to network and actively discuss a shared vision of the future of the field. Findings – This case demonstrates the need for proactive strategic management which goes well beyond the institutional boundary, into national policy and European decision making. As other areas of European research begin to think about the importance of European cooperation, lessons can be drawn from the experience of this particular sector. The process of looking forward took on board the political context and allowed participants and the researchers to think beyond these boundaries. Research limitations/implications – Although this is a pioneering study, there is a danger that some inputs may not have been captured. The results build on the input of a limited number of experts only and on the literature available in the public domain. There were few participants discussing the future of a vast field of research and this may mean that important input has not been captured. Time limitations in the workshops necessarily limit the scope for experts and policy makers to engage with the concepts. Follow-up activities based on the research outputs are required for the findings to go forward. Practical implications – Bringing together different stakeholders for shaping a shared vision through scenario workshops led to rich interactions and creative thinking. The workshops created a space for experts to consider policy options for reforming and making better use of the institutes in building the ERA. Originality/value – Using scenario workshops for foresight research results as an opportunity for stakeholders to visualise different futures for metrology research within Europe. The public research institute sector tends to be more generally under-studied as a component of modern innovation systems. We evaluate and show that the foresight process is an appropriate methodology to look at what is inherently a political process at the implementation level. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Measurement; Research methods; Research organizations; Statistical forecasting",,,,,,"Arnold, E., Barker, K., Slipersæter, S., (2010) Research Institutes in the ERA, , European Commission, DG Research; Carneiro, K., (2001) The Need for Metrology in Nanotechnology, , Danish Institute of Fundamental Metrology; (2008) Outcome of the Proceedings, , Competitiveness Council on 1 and 2 December 2008, Council Conclusions on the Definition of a “2020 Vision for the European Research Area”. 16767/08 RECH 410 COMPET 550; Georghiou, L., Cox, D., Keenan, M., Flanagan, K., Barker, K., (2003) A Comparative Analysis of Public, Semi-Public and Recently Privatised Research Centres, Summary Final Report, , European Commission, EUR 20805, Brussels; Jemala, M., Evolution of foresight in the global historical context (2010) foresight, 12 (4), pp. 65-81; Miles, I., Appraisal of alternative methods and procedures for producing regional foresight”, paper prepared for the STRATA-ETAN Expert Group Action on “Mobilising the regional foresight potential for an enlarged European Union (2002), European Commission, Research DG-Directorate K.

A major challenge to the understanding of the origins of this assignment is the archetypal ""key-lock vs. frozen accident"" dilemma. Here we re-examine this dilemma in light of 1) the fundamental veto on ""foresight evolution"", 2) modular structures of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and 3) the updated library of aa-binding sites in RNA aptamers successfully selected in vitro for eight amino acids.Results: The aa-binding sites of arginine, isoleucine and tyrosine contain both their cognate triplets, anticodons and codons. We have noticed that these cases might be associated with palindrome-dinucleotides. For example, one-base shift to the left brings arginine codons CGN, with CG at 1-2 positions, to the respective anticodons NCG, with CG at 2-3 positions. Formally, the concomitant presence of codons and anticodons is also expected in the reverse situation, with codons containing palindrome-dinucleotides at their 2-3 positions, and anticodons exhibiting them at 1-2 positions. A closer analysis reveals that, surprisingly, RNA binding sites for Arg, Ile and Tyr ""prefer"" (exactly as in the actual genetic code) the anticodon(2-3)/codon(1-2) tetramers to their anticodon(1-2)/codon(2-3) counterparts, despite the seemingly perfect symmetry of the latter. However, since in vitro selection of aa-specific RNA aptamers apparently had nothing to do with translation, this striking preference provides a new strong support to the notion of the genetic code emerging before translation, in response to catalytic (and possibly other) needs of ancient RNA life. Consistently with the pre-translation origin of the code, we propose here a new model of tRNA origin by the gradual, Fibonacci process-like, elongation of a tRNA molecule from a primordial coding triplet and 5'DCCA3' quadruplet (D is a base-determinator) to the eventual 76 base-long cloverleaf-shaped molecule.Conclusion: Taken together, our findings necessarily imply that primordial tRNAs, tRNA aminoacylating ribozymes, and (later) the translation machinery in general have been co-evolving to ''fit'' the (likely already defined) genetic code, rather than the opposite way around. Coding triplets in this primal pre-translational code were likely similar to the anticodons, with second and third nucleotides being more important than the less specific first one. Later, when the code was expanding in co-evolution with the translation apparatus, the importance of 2-3 nucleotides of coding triplets ""transferred"" to the 1-2 nucleotides of their complements, thus distinguishing anticodons from codons. This evolutionary primacy of anticodons in genetic coding makes the hypothesis of primal stereo-chemical affinity between amino acids and cognate triplets, the hypothesis of coding coenzyme handles for amino acids, the hypothesis of tRNA-like genomic 3' tags suggesting that tRNAs originated in replication, and the hypothesis of ancient ribozymes-mediated operational code of tRNA aminoacylation not mutually contradicting but rather co-existing in harmony.Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Eugene V.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines the construction and estimation of the instrument through a seven-step process. A total of 57 preliminary Likert items were developed based on an extant. review and synthesis of definitions of foresight. The items were assessed through interviews and pre-testing. A preliminary instrument was administered to a selection of managers. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were employed to assess sub-scales and model fit. The instrument was evaluated in terms of reliability and validity. Findings - The study demonstrates a valid and reliable 12 Likert item scale for measuring managerial foresight. Research limitations/implications - Managerial foresight can now be assessed and tested for association with, for example, managerial or organizational performance variables.

Box 616, 6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands","Despite the basic idea of scenarios as providing a heuristic for identifying, understanding and responding to changed conditions, many scenario studies are criticized for treating the future as an incremental continuation of the past. To understand this discrepancy between theoretical ambitions and actual practice with regard to accommodating change we followed professional futurists around. We observed that futurist curtail and slice time and we identified two temporal repertoires that inhibit different views on how (academic) knowledge about past and present is used in assessing the future: historic determinism and futuristic difference. Our empirically informed analysis is a story about ambitions in line with the futuristic difference, the re-introduction and rise of historic determinism and finally the fall of futuristic difference. Our analysis of foresight in action and foresight output yields that the retreat to historic determinism is a major pitfall for futurists in general. Our story suggest that the futures studies community needs to develop and encourage more adequate responses to the 'siren' of historic determinism. Practitioners who aim to employ futuristic difference throughout the foresight endeavour would then be better equipped to succeed in their ambitions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Accommodating change; Foresight (in action); Futuristic difference; Historic determinism; Temporal repertoires","knowledge; theoretical study; Siren",,,,,"Berkhout, F., Hertin, J., Jordan, A., Socio-economic futures in climate change impact assessment: using scenarios as 'learning machines' (2002) Global Environmental Change, 12 (2), pp. 83-95; Davis, G., (1998), Creating Scenarios for Your Company's Future.

By this integrative approach, the field of art and culture can be linked to, as well as profit from, other fields where systems-theoretical approaches have been influential, such as sociology, psychology, communication theory and the natural sciences. We show that systems models help to describe and conceptualize essential phenomena characteristic of the fine arts, such as pattern formation, reduction of complexity, and self-reference. Pattern formation can be observed in emerging artistic styles, fashions and trends. The property of self-reference becomes tractable by using the concept of endosystems, i.e. systems that include participating observers and second circularity feedback. The consequences of such dynamics are uncertainty, destabilization, and diversification. Endosystemic modeling promises to capture core properties not only of contemporary art, laying an emphasis on novelty and self-reference. Endosystems are appropriate models of further social systems, especially markets systems, which pose problems for foresight. Within the horizon of foresight that is at all possible in endosystems, three futures scenarios are worked out for the art system. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Art market; Foresight; Novelty; Scenarios; Self-reference; Systems-theory","art; modeling",,,,,"Sardar, Z., Welcome to postnormal times (2010) Futures, 42, pp. 435-444; Luhmann, N., Das Kunstwerk und die Selbstreproduktion der Kunst (1986) Stil.

Sound governance, including elements that encourage foresight, is an important ingredient of managing global and local crisis situations. These crises are ever more apparent as a result of interdependence between consumer, firms and states across the world, especially with the ever increasing advent of instantaneous and low cost communication. This book examines the role of governance in local and multi-national businesses and in local, national and international political forums and organisations.

It has become increasingly clear that the erratic dynamics of markets is mostly endogenous and not due to the rational processing of exogenous news. I elaborate on the idea that spin-glass type of problems, where the combination of competition and heterogeneities generically leads to long epochs of statis interrupted by crises and hypersensitivity to small changes of the environment, could be metaphors for the complexity of economic systems. I argue that the most valuable contribution of physics to economics might end up being of methodological nature, and that simple models from physics and agent based numerical simulations, although highly stylized, are more realistic than the traditional models of economics that assume rational agents with infinite foresight and infinite computing abilities. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Carlos I, Lisboa, Portugal","Purpose - This paper seeks to discuss the process and results of a scenario exercise applied to the Portuguese tourism and hospitality industries with a 2020 horizon. Design/methodology/approach - Through an intuitive-logical process adapted to the specific purposes of the research, four alternative scenarios of the evolution of the industry were developed. The exercise involved three workshops, with the participation of a group of experts, academics, representatives from industry and local government. Findings - Based on the nature and dynamics of the key forces and trends, the four scenarios identified are: southern experience; global emotions; ""sin surprise""; and non-charming Portugal. In all scenarios there is increased global competition amongst tourist destinations. A desire for authenticity opens the opportunity for Portugal as a tourist destination but it also poses challenges for managers and policy makers. These scenarios are of practical use for managers, policy makers and other practitioners as they provide a framework for the development and assessment of robust strategies and policies, i.e. strategies that will survive several kinds of external development. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the knowledge of scenario methods in practice and to help policy planners and managers recognize, consider and reflect on uncertainties they are likely to face. The work is also valuable for the international foresight community by discussing the method and addressing some drawbacks of the scenario exercise and recommendations for practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Futures markets; Hospitality management; Portugal; Tourism management",,,,,,"Águas, P., Costa, J., Rita, P., A tourist market portfolio for Portugal (2000) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 12 (7), pp. 394-401; Altinay, L., Altinay, M., Bicak, H.A., Political scenarios: The future of the North Cyprus tourism industry (2000) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 14 (4), pp. 176-182; Amorim Varum, C., Melo, C., Directions in scenario planning literature - a review of the past decades (2010) Futures, 42 (4), pp. 355-369; Baldock, R., (1999) Destination Z: The History of the Future, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester; Bishop, P., Hines, A., Collins, T., The current state of scenario development: An overview of techniques (2007) Foresight, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Borjesson, L., Hojer, M., Dreborg, K.-H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario types and techniques: Towards a user's guide (2006) Futures, 38 (7), pp. 723-739; Bradfield, R., Wight, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., van der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Butler, R., Tourism in the future: Cycles, waves or wheels?

The basic claim is that consumer education needs to become empowering or emancipatory, and that this can be reached through emphasizing the futures aspect and skills concerning everyday futures work. The functions of traditional consumer education can be described as socializative, preventive and corrective. This is not enough in a rapidly changing world in which consumers face completely new challenges. Section 2 of this article studies changes focal to the individual consumer. In Section 3 I define the basic functions of a household as an economic unit, consumption and consumer education. In Section 4 I continue the analysis of the functions of consumer education with the help of the neologism everyday futures work, which is grounded on the application of Joseph Nuttin's theory of action. I also argue that to fulfill an empowering function, consumer education has to emphasize the futures aspect. The core concept here is futures-will, which highlights the dynamic character of human action. In Section 5 I suggest relevant solutions for consumer education in relation to the challenges and functions of consumption described above as well as explain how the enhancing of everyday futures work skills could be applied in the framework of the cycle of human action. I conclude the article by discussing some recent topics in consumer education to show that consumer education thinking is in some measure - even if not often explicitly expressed - converging with futures education. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Consumer education; Everyday foresight; Everyday futures work; Futures education; Futures-will","consumption behavior; education; empowerment",,,,,"McGregor, S.L.T., Sustainable consumer empowerment through critical consumer education: a typology of consumer education approaches (2005) International Journal of Consumer Studies, 29 (5), pp. 437-447. , http://www.consultmcgregor.com/research.php?cid=9, p. 9 (accessed 2.10.10); http://ddp-ext.worldbank.org/ext/DDPQQ/member.do%3Fmethod=getMembers, World Bank Database, Table 11A, Individual Consumption Expenditure by Households 2005/Expenditure Shares of GDP (Percentage Share, GDP=100, XR term).

A philosopher and theologian, he was Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy of the Catholic institute in Paris and also an expert at the Second Vatican Council. He was also intimately conversant with mathematical logic and nuclear physics. This article first appeared three years after the first electronic calculating machine came into service in 1945 in the United States (though electro-mechanical calculators had been built before the war). This was the ENIAC machine (Electronic Numerical Integrator Analyser and Computer). During the Second World War, the British had built the Colossus calculating machine and broken the Wehrmacht's secret Lorenz code with it. The life of ENIAC was short and it was, at the time, the only known example of an operational electronic ""computer"". As early as 1945 the mathematician John von Neumann had proposed building a more efficient model operating on binary logic. Dominique Dubarle's article was a genuine piece of scientific foresight, since it formulated hypotheses on the development of future calculating machines and their application to many sectors of economic, social and political life that have since proved accurate. It is noteworthy, for example, that he points out the importance of computers for the rapid processing of data and their use for ""automatic bibliographical listing"", which is possible today thanks to the World Wide Web. He also stressed the importance of the founding text of cybernetics which Norbert Wiener had just brought out in France with the Hermann publishing house: Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (Paris, 1948). As a philosopher and subtle mathematician, Dominique Dubarle ended his article with a warning against the dangers of blind faith in the virtues of these new sciences: ""human processes"" could not, he said, be predicted with the aid of ""cold mathematics."" These premonitory remarks might also have been profitably studied before the crisis of 2008 by the enthusiastic proponents of financial mathematics.",,,,,,,"Paris : Hermann 6 Cie, 1948; Défense contre avions (ou aéronefs) (NDLR); (1948) Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, , Paris : Hermann & Cie; Rosenblueth, A., Wiener, N., Bigelow, J., Behavior, purpose and teleology (1943) Philosophy of Science, 10, pp. 18-24","Dubarle, D.",,,,,,,,0337307X,,,,"French","Futuribles Anal.

The adoption of governance measures that surpass the national scope, reaching a transnational character, can contribute to avoid or to reduce these problems at least. But, in addition, globalisation seems to have accentuated the unpredictability of the crises, as it can be verified in the current one: it is a global crisis, and, what is more, despite the prior existence of warnings about several imbalances in financial markets and in the global economy, neither supervisors nor the multilateral organisations predicted the exact form that it would take, the timing of its onset and the nature of its consequences. However, this lack of foresight does not seem to be an inherent feature of the current crisis, but rather a common factor to external financial crises in the globalisation era. And it happens despite the existence of a large variety of methods to assess country risk and, therefore, to measure the risk of a crisis episode, particularly the so-called ""country risk indexes"". The aim of this chapter is to contrast whether the two indexes most known and used by experts, the Euromoney index and the ICRG, were capable of predicting well in advance the crises episodes that occurred during the period 1994-2002. For this purpose, we consider a sample that includes 13 countries in crisis and 50 countries which, even belonging to the same ""country risk group"" as the first, did not develop a crisis. On the basis of this sample, both discriminant and logistic regression analyses are performed in order to check the success of both indexes in discriminating between the two groups. The results indicate that neither of the selected indexes were suitable for carrying out this objective. These results suggest two conclusions: the first is that country risk indexes, although able to reflect a certain set of economic vulnerabilities, do not appear to identify the last combination of factors which trigger a crisis; the second is that in a globalised world the governance models must reject the approaches based on the easy predictability of economic events, assuming on the contrary the relevance of the uncertainty in the analysis and the management of the economic reality. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Discounting paradigms quantify the ability to refrain from preference of immediate rewards, in favour of delayed, larger rewards. As such, they measure temporal foresight and the ability to delay gratification, functions that develop slowly into adulthood. We investigated the neural maturation that accompanies the previously observed age-related behavioural changes in discounting, from early adolescence into mid-adulthood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of a hypothetical discounting task with monetary rewards delayed in the week to year range. We show that age-related reductions in choice impulsivity were associated with changes in activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum (VS), insula, inferior temporal gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex. Limbic frontostriatal activation changes were specifically associated with age-dependent reductions in impulsive choice, as part of a more extensive network of brain areas showing age-related changes in activation, including dorsolateral PFC, inferior parietal cortex, and subcortical areas. The maturational pattern of functional connectivity included strengthening in activation coupling between ventromedial and dorsolateral PFC, parietal and insular cortices during selection of delayed alternatives, and between vmPFC and VS during selection of immediate alternatives. We conclude that maturational mechanisms within limbic frontostriatal circuitry underlie the observed post-pubertal reductions in impulsive choice with increasing age, and that this effect is dependent on increased activation coherence within a network of areas associated with discounting behaviour and inter-temporal decision-making. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,"adolescent; adult; age; article; behavior change; child; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; corpus striatum; decision making; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; impulsiveness; insula; limbic cortex; limbic system; male; maturation; normal human; parietal lobe; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; reward; school child; self control; striate cortex; task performance; volunteer; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Choice Behavior; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Impulsive Behavior; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Reward; Young Adult",,,,,"Adleman, N.E., Menon, V., Blasey, C.M., White, C.D., Warsofsky, I.S., Glover, G.H., Reiss, A.L., A developmental fMRI study of the Stroop color-word task (2002) Neuroimage, 16, p. 61; Alessi, S.M., Petry, N.M., Pathological gambling severity is associated with impulsivity in a delay discounting procedure (2003) Behav Processes, 64, pp. 345-354; Ballard, K., Knutson, B., Dissociable neural representations of future reward magnitude and delay during temporal discounting (2009) Neuroimage, 45, pp. 143-150; Barkley, R.A., Edwards, G., Laneri, M., Fletcher, K., Metevia, L., Executive functioning, temporal discounting, and sense of time in adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (2001) J.

On the one hand, networks can help companies to achieve and sustain competitive advantage; on the other hand, networks bear the risk of locking-in companies. Strategic foresight has long been used by single firms to keep up with competition and a fast changing environment. While strategic foresight processes on firm level are common, approaches addressing the network perspective are still rare. The goal of this paper is twofold. At first, this paper aims to develop criteria for strategic foresight methods within production networks. Second, a strategic foresight approach for firms operating in production networks is presented. This approach fits into earlier published generic foresight processes for single firms and tries to respond to the prevailing complexity within production networks firms are facing.","Manufacturing flexibility; Network modeling; Production networks; Scenarios; Strategic foresight; System dynamics","Competition; Locks (fasteners); Manufacturing flexibility; Network modeling; Production network; Scenarios; Strategic foresight; System Dynamics; Complex networks",,,,,"Teece, D.J., Pisano, G., Shuen, A., Dynamic capabilities and strategic management (1997) Strategic Management Journal, 18, pp. 509-533; Duncan, R.B., Characteristics of organizational environments and perceived environmental uncertainty (1972) Administrative Science Quarterly, 17, pp. 313-327; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18, pp. 21-33; Frishammar, J., Characteristics in information processing approaches (2002) International Journal of Information Management, 22, pp. 143-156; Tsoukas, H., Shepherd, J., Coping with the future: Developing organizational foresightfulness (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 137-144; Horton, A., A simple guide to sucessful foresight (1999) Foresight: The Journal of Future Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 1, pp. 5-9; Slaughter, R.A., Futures studies as an intellectual and applied discipline (1998) American Behavioral Scientist, 42, pp. 372-385; Slaughter, R.A., Beyond the mundane: Reconciling breadth and depth in futures enquiry (2002) Futures, 34, pp. 493-507; Gupta, D., On measurement and valuation of manufacturing flexibility (1993) International Journal of Production Research, 31, pp. 2947-2958; Chang, A.-Y., Whitehouse, D., Chang, S.-L., Hsieh, Y.-C., An approach to the measurement of singlemaschine flexibility (1996) International Journal of Production Research, 39, pp. 1589-1601; Chang, S.-C., Lin, N.-P., Sheu, C., Aligning manufacturing flexibility with environmental uncertainty: Evidence from high-technology component manufacturers in Taiwan (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40, pp. 4765-4780; Chen, I., Chung, C.-H., An examination of flexibility measurements and performance of flexible manufacturing systems (1996) International Journal of Production Research, 34, pp. 379-394; Wiendahl, H.-P., ElMaraghy, H.A., Nyhius, P., Zaeh, M., Wiendahl, H.-H., Duffie, N.A., Brieke, M., Changeable manufacturing - Classification (2007) Design and Operation, CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology, 56, pp. 783-809; Jarillo, C., On strategic networks (1988) Strategic Management Journal, 9, pp. 31-41; Jarillo, J.C., (1993) Strategic Networks, Creating the Borderless Organization, , Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford; Thorelli, H.B., Networks: Between markets and hierarchies (1986) Strategic Management Journal, 7, pp. 37-51; Bettis, R.A., Prahalad, C.K., The dominant logic: Retrospective and extension (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 5-14; Blackman, D.A., Henderson, S., How foresight creates unforeseen futures: The role of doubting (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 253-266; Voros, J., A generic foresight process framework (2003) Foresight: The Journal of Future Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 5, pp. 10-21; Zheng, L., Possel-Dölken, F., (2002) Supply Chain Management, In: Strategic Production Networks, pp. 223-367. , Zheng, L.

Tasks used to study the development of episodic foresight in young children are reviewed and compared to tasks used to study other future-oriented abilities (planning, delay of gratification, and prospective memory) in the same age-group. We argue for the importance of accounting for and minimizing the role of other cognitive demands in research tasks. Because episodic foresight is an emerging ability in young children, more research needs to be directed at the contexts in which it emerges and the extent to which episodic foresight is part of a growing ability for mental representation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Delay of gratification; Episodic foresight; Future; Mental time travel; Planning; Prospective memory; Time",,,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45 (7), pp. 1363-1377; Atance, C.M., Future thinking in young children (2008) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17 (4), pp. 295-298; Atance, C.M., Jackson, L.K., The development and coherence of future-oriented behaviors during the preschool years (2009) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 102 (4), pp. 379-391; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: Young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20 (3), pp. 341-361; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., Preschoolers' current desires warp their choices for the future (2006) Psychological Science, 17 (7), pp. 583-587; Atance, C., O'Neill, D.K., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5 (12), pp. 533-539; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., Planning in 3-year-olds: A reflection of the future self?

The development of a social, not only a strictly scientific vision of the future has become crucial. It appears that the biggest role in this context played technology foresight programs (whose origins go back even to the 70's), integrating traditional methods of forecasting as well as those derived from the social sciences, economics, management science, etc. The paper presents a rich collection of foresight methods identified by the author, a general outline and characteristics of various types of methods, and an innovative classification of technology foresight research methods. Because of the huge complexity of the approach to technological foresight and its further evolution, the ability to classify and identify the typology of methods may be necessary for an orderly and rational way of structuring foresight projects. © 2011 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","classification; cluster analysis; research methodology; technology foresight; typology",,,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Sanders, T.I., Identifying systems' new initial conditions as influence points for the future (2006) Foresight, 8 (3), pp. 28-35; Alexandrova, M., Marinova, D., Tchonkova, D., Keenan, M., Popper, R., Havas, A., (2007) Research Infrastructures Foresight, , A practical guide for integrating foresight in research infrastructures policy formulation; Amanatidou, E., Joint foresight: towards a mechanism for joint programming in Europe?

In doing so, a further aim of the project was to assess whether a shared European concept of security could be identified. The project provides policy support and advice for researchers and decisionmakers, with a view to offering recommendations on European foresight and research priorities. After explaining the methodology employed in the project, the chapter will briefly review some of the outcomes, before critically analysing identified limitations and benefits of using participatory foresight in the field of international security. The chapter finally offers an assessment of the contribution that can realistically be expected from security foresight projects employed to generate policy and research support in international contexts, and makes recommendations about how foresight can be anchored systematically into EU-level security policy and research activities. Using the experience of the FORESEC project, this chapter speaks directly to one of the central ambitions of this book, namely to explore different methods and approaches in dealing with uncertainty and to assess their merits and perils. © Chiara de Franco and Christoph O.

The effectiveness of such models depends on their ability to support the management of water, ecosystem and societal resources, and the development of such abilities is one of the goals of the InterAcademy Pannel Water Programme. This ability to manage water, ecosystem and social resources is based on full, objective, politically unbiased, and forward-looking information and knowledge. For a long time, environmental modelling has been a source of such information. In recent years foresight has beginning to play a similar role; however, the practical integration of foresight in integrated sustainable management has been very limited. One of the causes of this is the fact that the instrument is not very well known among the people responsible for sustainable management. Therefore, the aim of the article is to close the knowledge gap and to present the basic issues connected to the foresight methodology as a tool for formulating plans for sustainable management of water, energy, environment and society.","foresight; integrated models of sustainable management","energy resource; environmental management; environmental modeling; numerical model; sustainable development; water management",,,,,"Aicholzer, G., (2001) Delphi Austria: An Example of Tailoring Foresight to the Needs of a Small Country, , Institute of Technology Assessment, Vienna; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Barkenbus, J., (1998) Expertise and the Policy Cycle., , www.gdrc.org/decision/policy-cycle.pdf, (23.11.2006); Beck, M.B., (2002) Environmental Foresight and Models., , Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford; Beven, K., (2009) Environmental Modelling: An Uncertain Future?, , Rutledge, Oxon; Bruntlandt, G.H., (1987) Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future., , http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/en/d/d7/Our-common-future.pdf, (12.10.2007); Carlsson, Ch., Fuller, R., Majlender, P., A fuzzy approach to R&D project selection (2005) Proceedings of the Joint 4th Conference of the European Society for Fuzzy Logic and Technology and the 11th Rencontres Francophonessur la Logique Floue et ses Applications, pp. 536-540. , Montseny, E., Sobrevilla, P.

The purpose of this paper is to describe recent technological foresight conducted by the Technology Foresight Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Evaluation and Planning. The authors also address current issues and problems encountered in the process of technology foresight (TF) in Korea. Design/methodology/approach – The authors used TF methodologies which included bibliometrics, expert panels, SWOT analysis, and conferences/seminars. Findings – The authors derived 20 future issues and 40 future needs in S&T from the five areas of global mega trends; then 200 future technologies were suggested with a time horizon of 40 years, from 2010 to 2050, for solving those future issues and needs. Finally, the authors suggested outlooks for technological development in the years 2020 and 2050. Research limitations/implications – It is time to evaluate Korean TF exercises which were started 15 years ago. The evaluation of TF will help guide TF and inform policy and decision makers. Practical implications – The findings can help policy makers shape future governmental S&T policy in Korea. The final result of this work was applied to the second S&T Framework Plan in Korea, in which 90 technologies were identified as national key technologies for the next five years, from 2008 to 2012. Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no studies suggesting not only future technologies based on solving future issues and needs but also outlooks for technology development in the years 2020 and 2050. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Global mega trends; Government policy; Korea; Public science and technology policy; Sciences; Technology foresight; Technology led strategy",,,,,,"Byeon, S.C., Ryu, J., Son, S., Choi, M.J., (2008) Evaluation of Technology Level Using a Dynamic Method on the Critical Technologies in the 2Nd S&Amp;T Basic Plan in Korea, , www.eval.org, paper presented at AEA 2008 Annual Conference, Denver, CO; Gavigan, J.P., Scapolo, F., Matching methods to the mission: A comparison of national foresight exercises (1999) Foresight, 1 (6), pp. 495-517; (2006) Science &Amp; Technology Outlook: 2005-2055, , www.iftf.org/node/757, IFTF; Martin, B., (1993) Research Foresight and the Exploitation of the Science Base, , HMSO, London; (2008) Main Science and Technology Indicators (2008-2), , www.oecd.org, OECD; Park, B., Schlossstein, D.F., (2006) Comparing Recent Technology Foresight Studies in Korea and China Towards Foresight Minded Government?, , www.asialics.org, paper presented at 3rd Asialics International Conferences, Shanghai; (2007) Regional Initiative on Technology Foresight, , www.unido.org, UNIDO; (2005) The Future Perspective &Amp; Technology Foresight of Korea, , www.kistep.re.kr/ksp/eng/main/main.jsp, MOST and KISTEP; (2005) Comprehensive Analysis of Science and Technology Benchmarking and Foresight, , www.nistep.go.jp, NISTEP, NISTEP Report No. 99","Kim, Y.J.; Seoul National UniversitySouth Korea",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,20513143,,,,"English","Compet.

First, the advancement of the disaster management concept evolving from a cyclic perspective to a spiral view is described and the various stages of disaster management including risk analysis, mitigation, and response are explained. In an attempt to improve and advance disaster risk management, next, the concepts of foresight and prediction are described and its major differences are highlighted. Finally, the basic framework of risk governance is considered for integrating foresight and prediction and thus lifting disaster management to the next level. Active and transparent communication and participation is seen as the key for successfully implementing risk governance.","Involvement; Participation; Public awareness; Risk governance; Risk perception","Disasters; Forecasting; Information systems; Risk perception; Disaster management; Integrated disaster risk management; Involvement; Participation; Public awareness; Risk characteristics; Risk governance; Disaster prevention",,,,,"Aubrecht, C., Köstl, M., Knoflacher, M., Steinnocher, K., The importance of active public communication - Settlement systems and land use patterns seen from a disaster perspective (2009) Strategies, Concepts and Technologies for Planning the Urban Future.

This paper identifies classes of factors which have lead to unintended consequences in the privacy and computer security domains, though the list is by no means exhaustive. It is primarily intended to inspire further thinking and research.

As a result changes in market and business environment need to be thought ahead. A method to think ahead about future developments is the scenario technique. Based on the principles ""networked thinking"" and ""multiple futures"" consistent pictures of the futures are developed. Today - more than ever - developments of market and business environment are characterized by unforeseen and unexpected incidents, so called Wild Cards. Wild Cards are future developments or events with a low probability, but a presumably high impact on the conduct of business. Therefore it is essential for companies to be prepared for an abruptly changing environment. Examples such as the 9/11 terrorist attack or the subprime-crisis in the USA showed the immense impact on our economy. But so far Wild Cards are - in spite of their huge impact on the development of a scenario - not sufficiently integrated in the scenario technique. Due to this, we developed an approach to integrate Wild Cards into the scenario technique. Our method enables companies to think ahead about Wild Cards as well as their impact on the environment and the company. Depending on these impacts appropriate preventive and reactive actions are developed. In this paper, a case study from the energy industry shows how to deal with Wild Cards in the scenario technique.","Scenario technique; Strategic foresight; Strategic product planning; Wild Cards","Commerce; Exhibitions; Business environments; Changing environment; Impact on the environment; Scenario technique; Strategic foresight; Strategic product planning; Unexpected incidents; Wild cards; Industry",,,,,"Barber, M., Wildcards - Signals from a future near you (2006) Journal of Futures Studies, 11 (1), pp. 75-94; Burmann, C., Freiling, J., Hülsmann, M., (2005) Management von Adhoc-Krisen - Grundlagen - Strategien - Erfolgsfaktoren, , Betriebswirtschaftlicher Verlag Dr. Th.

The implementation of this reform is to be staggered up to late 2014. Given the time that will elapse before it is fully implemented, it is not yet possible to assess its effects concretely, but it is improbable, judging from this article, that it will produce a genuine simplification of the territorial organization of France, even though such a simplification is regularly advocated and clearly very necessary. Hence the importance of continued foresight thinking on the subject. This is what Martin Vanier and Pierre-Jean Lorens propose here, on the basis of what they call ""the inter-territorial hypothesis"", which consists in thinking not in terms of institutional and decisional levels or fields of jurisdiction, but in terms of active links that can be established between all the existing levels of territorial authority and jurisdiction. The point is to attempt to determine the system which might, over a period of one or two decades, link together all French levels of authority. To do so, the authors present the results of thinking and studies to which they have contributed in recent years, and the four scenarios that have come out of their exploratory territorial foresight study, entitled: ""the Metropolises, New Territorial Powers"", ""the Regions, Major Implementers of Inter-territoriality"", ""Low Intensity Inter-territoriality"" and ""Networks, Masters of Territories"". So many lines of thinking that will, without doubt, fuel future debates on a recurrent and crucial subject, both nationally and from a European perspective.",,,,,,,"Balladur, É., (rapporteur du Comité pour la réforme des collectivités locales).

This is troubling, because corporate foresight capabilities are closely associated with the ability of a firm to retain its competitive advantage in times of discontinuous change (Levinthal 1992:427; Teece et al. 1997:509; Eisenhardt and Martin 2000:1105; Helfat and Peteraf 2003:1007) and its ability to ensure long-term survival (Stubbart and Knight 2006:79; Anderson and Tushman 1990:604; Audretsch 1995:441). Even though I was able to identify various best practices in specific capability dimensions, none of the firms had implemented a comprehensive, stable, and effective corporate foresight system. Most companies had mature practices in one or two capability dimensions but few capabilities in the others.

To benefit from this opportunity, it is important to understand the strategic factors and future trends that affect the development of an efficient FLOSS economy in developing countries. This paper aims to examine the strategic factors and future trends that are likely to affect the development and deployment of FLOSS in Turkey. Based on the internal and external factors identified through the practice of technological foresight, a SWOT analysis will be carried out to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for Turkey in creating a competitive software industry that can benefit from the advantages of FLOSS. Accordingly, with regard to the required technical infrastructure, an innovative/competitive business climate, skilled human resources and support for institutional structures, policy suggestions are outlined here that could be usefully implemented by government, industry and universities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Developing country; FLOSS; Free software; Open source; Software development; Technological foresight","Developing countries; Open systems; Software design; Software engineering; FLOSS; Free software; Free/libre open source softwares; Institutional structure; Internal and external factors; Open sources; Technical infrastructure; Technological foresight; Open source software",,,,,"Archibugi, D., Lundvall, B.-A., (2001) The Globalizing Learning Economy, , Oxford University Press New York; Baltac, V., (2003) Information Society and Its Challenges to Emerging Economies, , UNIDO Technology Foresight Summit Budapest, Hungary; Bruggink, M., (2003) Open Source Software: Take It or Leave It, the Status of Open Source Software in Africa, , International Institute for Communication and Development, Research Brief No UICT01; Camara, G., Fonseca, F., Information policies and open source software in developing countries (2007) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58 (1), pp. 121-132. , DOI 10.1002/asi.20444; Cases, P., Doing open source right: Five best practices for buying from the open-source community (2005) Information Weeks Optimize, 46, pp. 20-22; Cuhls, K., Foresight competencies for managing the future (2003) Proceedings of the First Nordic Conference, Fraunhofer Institute Systems and Innovation Search, , Lübeck, Germany; Daffara, C., (2009) The SME Guide to Open Source Software-Fourth Edition, , http://smeguide.conecta.it/smeguide.pdf, Free/Libre Open Source Software Metrics Project.

The Rapport Vigie 2011, published in late December 2010, offers a foresight analysis of seven key issues, before going on to propose four scenarios for France in the years to 2030. Cécile Désaunay and François de Jouvenel, who made very major contributions to the production of this report (available in its entirety only to partner-members of Futuribles International), offer a summary in this article of these four scenarios relating to France in 2030: ""Competitiveness and Social Responsibility of Companies"", ""Dual Society"", ""Broad Middle Class"" and ""Local Economy"". As in all exploratory foresight studies, the authors do not favour any of the scenarios in particular, the four of them enabling the reader to form an idea of the various possible trajectories for France and the French over the next 20 years.

For instance, the 2008 report of the US Project on National Security Reform, probably the most authoritative recent review of security issues from a US perspective, argued that the ‘current environment virtually puts a premium on foresight - the ability to anticipate unwelcome contingencies’ (Project on National Security Reform, 2008: vii). Leading Canadian environmental-security expert Thomas Homer-Dixon has called for the development of ‘prospective mind’, and former national-security advisor to Vice President Al Gore, Leon Fuerth (2009), has advocated ‘forward engagement’: both are roughly comparable calls for systematic, sustained and highly proactive consideration of potential future challenges in a wide range of connected-issue domains (see also Homer-Dixon, 2006). And, in terms of concrete actions, numerous governments, multinational groupings and private sector organisations have in recent years established programs to more effectively anticipate challenges in security and other issue areas: among the most prominent are Singapore’s Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning program (RAHS), the UK’s Horizon Scanning Unit, OECD’s Futures Program, and the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Program (see, e.g., Habegger, 2008). © Chiara de Franco and Christoph O.

Our aim was to elucidate as fully as possible the nature of TA's impairment and to test the hypothesis of confabulation as reflecting a dysfunction of Temporal Consciousness, i.e. to become aware of something as part of a personal past, present or future. TA's confabulations were present in answers to questions tapping Temporal Consciousness, i.e. autobiographical episodic memory, orientation in time and place, and foresight of personal future. In contrast, confabulations were not observed in answers to questions tapping Knowing Consciousness, i.e. to become aware of something as a meaning or as an element of impersonal knowledge. In fact, he had normal access to semantic knowledge, including foresight of impersonal future. TA's brain MRI showed lesions involving the right hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, fornix, mammillary bodies, and thalamus. Moreover TA showed sub-cortical lesions involving the caudate and putamen nuclei bilaterally, a lesion site not commonly described in amnesic-confabulatory syndrome. We suggest that this pattern of results is better accounted for within the framework of the Memory, Consciousness and Temporality Theory and reflects a specific distortion of Temporal Consciousness. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

We follow an alternative approach, where the market is represented by a forward curve with daily granularity, the price uncertainty is represented by six factors, and where we impose a simple and intuitive storage strategy. Based on UK natural gas market price data, we obtain the gas storage value using our approach, and compare with results from a one-factor model as well as with perfect foresight. We find that our approach captures much more of the true flexibility value than the one-factor model.

In general break even costs based on normal discounted cash flow (DCF) method are referred in a discussion on CCS diffusions. These evaluations with static and perfect foresight assumptions indicate that the break even costs for CCS diffusions are moderate, around US$35/tCO2. In contrast it seems that an early large-scale commercialization of CCS is far from ideal due to technical, economical, social barriers and their uncertainties. In terms of economical aspect, carbon value and fuel price are very uncertain. In this study we focus on cost analysis of power plant replacement and CCS investment as a replacement for an aged coal plant. In this analysis carbon price and gas price are explicitly uncertain. Using a real options approach we found the threshold between ""waiting"" and ""investment right now"". ""Waiting"" means that the firm continues to operate the aged coal plant, which has low thermal efficiency and high CO2 intensity. ""Investment right now"" means that the firm throws out another investment options. The results indicate that it requires substantially higher carbon prices, e.g., US$70/tCO2, for CCS diffusions under uncertainty. The threshold for CCS investment is also affected by gas price. For example, in the middle range gas price (around US$10/GJ), the threshold can be over US$100/tCO2. In addition possibility of free allocation based on absolute historical emissions (grandfathering) makes it more difficult to invest CCS. On the other hand existing (aged) coal plants have strong competitiveness under uncertainty. It seems that this is consistent with real situations in each country. Reducing uncertainty of climate policy is the key to an early CCS diffusion. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Aged coal plant; Carbon capture and storage; Investment; Real options approach; Uncertainty","Coal; Coal storage; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Diffusion; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Coal plants; Discounted cash flow; Historical emissions; Investment under uncertainty; Perfect foresights; Real options approach; Uncertainty; Carbon capture",,,,,"Cox, D.R., Miller, H.D., (1965) The Theory of Stochastic Processes, , London: Chapman and Hall; David, J., Herzog, H., The cost of carbon capture (2000) Proceedings of the GHGT-5; Dixit, A.K., Pindyck, R.S., (1994) Investment under Uncertainty, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Hamilton, M.R., Herzog, H.J., Parsons, J.E., Cost and U.S. public policy for new coal power plants with carbon capture and sequestration (2008) Proceedings of the GHGT-9, 1 (1), pp. 4487-4494; (2007) Climate Policy Uncertainty and Invest Risk, in Support of the G8 Plan of Action, , IEA, Paris; (2010) Projected Costs of Generating Electricity: 2010 Update, , NEA, OECD/Nuclear Energy Agency.

Today, businesses may make use of enterprise asset-management (EAM) solutions for many asset-related processes, ranging from the core asset-management functions to maintenance, inventory, contracts, warranties, procurement, and customer-service management. While EAM solutions have transformed the operational aspects of asset management through data capture and process automation, the decision-making process with respect to assets still heavily relies on institutional knowledge and anecdotal insights. Analytics-driven asset management is an approach that makes use of advanced analytics and optimization technologies to transform the vast amounts of data from asset management, metering, and sensor systems into actionable insight, foresight, and prescriptions that can guide decisions involving strategic and tactical assets, as well as customer and business models. © 2011 by International Business Machines Corporation.",,"Business models; Customer-service; Decision making process; Institutional knowledge; Operational aspects; Optimization technology; Physical assets; Process automation; Sensor systems; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Information management; Sales; Asset management",,,,,"http://www.dcwater.com, District of Columbia, Water and Sewer Authority.

Though, words in Turkish can be classified in eight different linguistic categories (noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, adverb, postposition, conjunction and interjection), they can be discriminated in two fundamental groups as nouns and verbs. We have utilized logistic regression method to determine and compare the features based on sentence and word properties considering that all linguistic categories except verbs can be merged into the to the noun originated group. The strength of both categorical (such as inclusion of capital letters, apostrophes) and numerical features (such as position in sentence) in verb discrimination are examined and results are presented. We believe that this study may contribute to the time consuming rule based or probabilistic POS tagging applications since logistic regression analysis gives an immediate foresight of verbs. © 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.","Logistic regression; POS tagging; Turkish","Fundamental group; Linguistic categories; Logistic regression analysis; Logistic regression method; Logistic regressions; Nouns and verbs; Numerical features; POS tagging; Rule based; Turkish; Turkishs; Linguistics; Regression analysis",,,,,"Hankamer, J., (1984) Turkish Generative Morphology and Morphological Parsing, , In: Second International Conference on Turkish Linguistics.

To provide on-demand searches, we tackled two technical issues: (1) organizing efficient event searches and (2) filtering out noises from search results. Our system employed query expansion with typical expressions related to event information such as year expressions, temporal modifiers, and context terms for efficient event searches. We utilized a machine-learning technique of filtering noise to classify candidates into information or non-event information, using heuristic features and lexical patterns derived from a text-mining approach. Our experiment revealed that filtering achieved an 85% F-measure, and that query expansion could collect dozens more events than those without expansion. © 2011 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Futuristics; Futurology; Information retrieval; Scenario planning; Strategic foresight; Text mining; Vertical search","Classification (of information); Data mining; Expansion; Information filtering; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Futuristics; Futurology; Scenario Planning; Strategic foresight; Text mining; Vertical searches; Search engines",,,,,"Baeza-Yates, R., Searching the future (2005) ACM SIGIR, , Workshop MF/IR; Brun, P., Kawai, H., Kunieda, K., Yamada, K., Chronoseeker: Future opinion extraction and classification, 2009 (2009) IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence; Choudhury, M.D., Ssundaram, H., John, A., Seligman, D.D., Can blog communication dynamics be correlated with stock market activity?

Critical factors and trends of structural changes in agriculture are identified. Results of comparative analysis of the development of farms in European countries and Russia are presented. Studies have shown that at the end of the last century there have been the following trends in the global agriculture: there has been a trend of farm consolidation in size, new controls and control of production are were introduced as well as more stringent quality standards of ecology were launched, which, in turn, require introduction of new technics and technologies; the processes of plants and animals development become more controllable and manageable. Conseptual foresights of pricing in the food market are given. Priority areas of agricultural policy aimed at creating conditions for sustainable rural development and accelerated growth in agricultural production by improving its competitiveness are identified.","Agricultural economic policy; Agriculture; Food",,,,,,"Gosudarstvennaya programma razvitiya sel'skogo khozyaystva i regulirovaniya rynkov sel'skokhozyaystvennoy produktsii, syr'ya i prodovol'stviya na 2008-2012 gody.

Specifically, the conventional disciplines in Rocket Science lacks foresight into the physics of acceleration to include the nature of gravity and inertia, which is foremost needed for the progression of spaceflight.

This article argues that the post-Mao era reform represents both continuity and discontinuity with the immediate past, and a complex mingling of Mao's legacy with new initiatives. The origins of many reform policies, as well as their accomplishments, could be traced back to the Mao era. They were often conditioned by, benefited from, or were built upon the outcomes of Mao's policies. These included the decisions to normalize China's relations with the United States and develop friendship with Third World countries, efforts to decentralize economic power and industrialize China without urbanization, and the move to defeat ""capitalist roaders"" but call Deng Xiaoping back to office. Overall, the turn toward capitalism of China has proven Mao's foresight, validated his concerns, and may be evidence of the lasting utility of Maoism. © 2011 Policy Studies Organization.","Capitalism; Chinese development strategy; Cultural revolution; Mao Zedong; Post-Mao reform",,,,,,"Brandt, L., (1989) Commercialization and agricultural development: Central and eastern China, 1870-1937, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Buck, J.L., (1968) Land utilization in China, , New York: Paragon Book Reprint; Burns, J.P., The People's Republic of China at 50: National political reform (1999) The China Quarterly, 159, pp. 580-594; Cao, Y., Nee, V.G., Comment: Controversies and evidence in the market transition debate (2000) American Journal of Sociology, 105, pp. 1175-1189; Chan, K.W., (1994) Cities with invisible walls: Reinterpreting urbanization in post-1949 China, , Hong Kong: Oxford University Press; Chan, R.C.K., The creation of global-local competitive advantages in Shanghai (2006) Globalization and the Chinese city, pp. 229-251. , W.

There is a concomitant need for foresight in describing supply chain performance in all operating environments, including those involving punctuated disruptions. Furthermore, the urban metropolis is now widely recognized to be an environment which is especially vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and for which integrated supply chain decisions can produce very substantial net benefits. Accordingly, this paper presents a dynamic supply chain network model formulated as a differential variational inequality; the model is fashioned to allow consideration of supply chain disruption threats to producers, freight carriers, and retail enterprises. The DVI is solved using a fixed-point algorithm, and a simple numerical example, introduced to illustrate how the impacts of supply chain disruptions may be quantified, is presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","City logistics; Differential variational inequalities; Disruptions; Dynamic supply chains; Supply chain networks; Urban supply chains","Enterprise resource planning; Variational techniques; City logistics; Differential variational inequality; Disruptions; Dynamic supply chains; Supply chain network; Supply chains; competition (economics); economic planning; logistics; network analysis; numerical model; performance assessment; urban economy; variance analysis",,,,,"Adida, E., Perakis, G., Dynamic pricing and inventory control: uncertainty and competition (2010) Operations Research, 58 (2), pp. 289-302; Christopher, M., Peck, H., Building the resilient supply chain (2004) International Journal of Logistics Management, 15 (2), pp. 1-13; Craighead, C.W., Blackhurst, J., Rungtusanatham, M.J., The severity of supply chain disruptions: design characteristics and mitigation capabilities (2007) Decision Sciences, 38 (1), pp. 131-156; Friesz, T.L., (2010) Dynamic Optimization and Differential Games, , Springer-Verlag; Kogan, K., Tapiero, C.S., (2007) Supply Chain Games: Operations Management and Risk Valuation, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Latour, A., Trial by fire: A blaze in albuquerque sets off major crisis for cell-phone giants (2001) Wall Street Journal, , January 29; Silberberg, E., Suen, W., (2000) The Structure of Economics: A Mathemathical Analysis, , McGraw-Hill, Irwin; Snyder, L.V., (2003), Supply Chain Robustness and Reliability: Models and Algorithm.

These models design a multi-tier chain operating in markets under deterministic price-depended demands and with a rival chain present. The existing rival chain tends to open some new retailers to recapture some income in a near future. These rival chains' structures are assumed to be set ""once and for all"" in a sequential manner but further price adjustments are possible. This problem is modeled for each of the following two strategies: (1) the von Stackelberg strategy in which we assume the existing chain will choose its future entry sites in the way to optimize its market share. This problem is modeled by a linear binary bi-level program and solved by a combinatorial meta-heuristic. (2) the minimum regret strategy in which we assume the existing chain's future entry sites are totally unpredic, it is playing a ""game against nature"".

Surprisingly little is known about how this faculty develops. In three experiments (N = 170), 3- and 4-year-old children were presented with simple puzzles. Fifteen minutes later in a different room they were given the opportunity to secure a solution to take back to the puzzle. Only the older children performed above chance, whereas both age groups could solve the task in an instant condition. The same pattern of results emerged for another task involving selection of something to 'feed' a puppet whose favorite food was initially unavailable. Control conditions suggest that temporal rather than spatial displacement influenced performance. Verbal reports substantiated the conclusion that by age 4 some children can remember a novel problem sufficiently enough to recognize a solution and select that solution in anticipation of applying it to the problem in the future. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"anticipation; article; child development; cognition; executive function; human; long term memory; male; memory; preschool child; problem solving; recall; Anticipation, Psychological; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Executive Function; Humans; Male; Memory; Mental Recall; Problem Solving; Retention (Psychology)",,,,,"Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Age-related changes in the episodic simulation of future events (2008) Psychological Science, 19, pp. 33-41; Atance, C.M., Meltzoff, A.N., My future self: young children's ability to anticipate and explain future states (2005) Cognitive Development, 20, pp. 341-361; Barr, R., Dowden, A., Hayne, H., Developmental changes in deferred imitation by 6- to 24-month-old infants (1996) Infant Behavior and Development, 19, pp. 159-171; Bischof, N., Morality as biological phenomenon (1978) On the phylogeny of human morality, pp. 53-74. , In, G.S.

However, our admission that we ""didn't see it coming"" has been consistently challenged by the common claim, made immediately following the attacks and persistently thereafter, that the massive destruction on September 11, 2001, uncannily resembled spectacular special-effects sequences from big-budget Hollywood action films we had been enjoying for years. The regular production and consumption of such films in the decades before 9/11 suggested that the ""unexpected"" attacks had actually been anticipated, perhaps even unconsciously desired, at least within the seemingly secure, fantastic realm of popular entertainment. In perhaps the most provocative of such claims, Slavoj Žižek declared that ""the unthinkable which happened was the object of fantasy, so that, in a way, America got what it fantasized about, and that was the biggest surprise"" (Welcome 15-16). © 2011 by Rutgers, The State University.

In general, the opinions of experts are given more credence than the opinions of non-experts. If objective evidence shows that a malfunction could not have been foreseen even by experts, the possibility of prediction is assumed to have not been possible. Experts can make a proper decision based on expertise related to the automatic machine coverage. However, non-experts might underestimate the coverage and become careful about handling of the system. When a malfunction that an expert cannot foresee occurs in such a situation, and results agree by chance with the forecast of a non-expert, engineers are questioned beyond reason about their ""responsibility"" - a trend particularly marked in relation to computer systems. As described in this paper, the case in which an Okazaki City Library user was arrested is an appropriate case study for this problem.

Any socio-economic system is a complex bio-technical system consisting of: a human - the decision maker, a technical object - machinery, equipment, buildings and structures, and a biological object - animals, plants, soil etc., operating in a consolidated informational field. An important place among the factors shaping financial sustainability of the economic entity is reserved for a human (the decision maker), since a human is a subject that purposefully forces all system's functions to interact. Socio-economic systems are characterized by financial dualism: on the one hand, they generate income, and on the other one, they generate costs. Financial result of a socio-economic system activity is expressed in the difference between revenues and expenditures, and the predominance of revenue over incurred costs speaks about the effectiveness. One of the most important characteristics of financial result is its resistance to various internal and external perturbations. Financial sustainability of the enterprise is reviewed from the perspective of bio-technical approach that includes the HME elements system (human, machine and environment) and allows to determine the contribution of each system element into the final result and the stability of these elements. This approach will allow to improve the adequacy of financial stability assessment results a of company in various states of the economy.",,,,,,,,,,,"Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences",,,,,20726414,,,,"Russian","Econ.

Also, it shows the affinity that exists among these practices, whether indigenous or exogenous in origin.By pulling the complex strands of the twenty contributions from all over Africa and elsewhere into a coherent unified framework, the editor, Professor Elias Mpofu, has reconfirmed his stature as an eminent African scholar in the fullest sense of the word, one with foresight, energy, tenacity, and a passion for his profession. With his vision of compiling a volume on present counseling practices for people of African ancestry, he afforded us the opportunity to look inward, to discover that there really is a “best practice” for counseling conditions, specifically for people of African ancestry. With this work, he and the other contributors laid the foundations for Africans, wherever we may find ourselves in the world, to look at each other, across borders and nations, and to discover that we have much in common, sharing counseling challenges and practices.The rich mosaic of Africanist voices contained in this publication aimed at the subject specialist yield connectivities, inform each other, and help us to understand how the human condition, in its multicultural African expressions, can be strengthened. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9780511977350; 9780521887229,,,"English","Counseling People of African Ancestry",Editorial,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926096846

The focus of the present review is to outline how the recent rapid expansion of genetic sequence data available for both pathogens and hosts can be exploited to develop new tools to improve the ways in which livestock diseases can be controlled. In the post-genomics era of the future, there will be a more intimate understanding of the way in which pathogens interact with their hosts and the key molecules that define host–pathogen relationships; knowledge that can be utilized to generate novel diagnostics and vaccination strategies. However, experience from the global rinderpest eradication programme highlights that effective disease control is a multifactorial process. Clearly, appropriate new therapeutic and diagnostic tools can play a critical role in our ability to monitor and limit the spread of diseases. However, adequate resources are also required: these are principally financial and also include the availability of trained personnel and veterinary infrastructure; international cooperation, transparency between different countries and sharing of epidemiological data and ownership of disease; acceptance of the difference in perception of importance of diseases in the developed world v. the developing world. © 2010, Cambridge University Press.

Twelve mixes were made (three individual samples, three binary mixes and six ternary mixes), analyzed on the content of total reducing sugars, total titratable acidity and phenolic compounds; and adjusted, respectively, to the linear, quadratic and special cubic models. The results were organized in ternary charts of surface response and, from the overlap of these charts, it was determined a viable region which delimited the range of apple juice compositions that make musts physically and chemically suitable to sparkling drink elaboration. To represent the various possible combinations, the central point of the triangular area of the viable region was calculated and, this point, which represents the proportions of 23.22% of Catarina, 66.23% of Granny Smith and 10.55% of Pink Lady cultivars, was chosen to constitute the formulation of the must to be used in the elaboration of apple sparkling drinks.","Apple; Blend; Must; Statistical design","Lycoris squamigera; Malus x domestica; Oenothera speciosa",,,,,"Barros Neto, B., Scarminio, I.S., Bruns, R.E., (2007) Como fazer experimentos: Pesquisa e desenvolvimento na ciência e na indústria, p. 480. , 3. ed.

The study will also focus on the two final commonalities, (4) and (5), listed above. To illustrate the symbiosis of industrial fabrication with hand craftsmanship in the work of Mackintosh, the presentation will address the Glasgow School of Art, noting as well the critical role process drawings played in this and all the architect's built projects. In discussing Van de Velde, the talk will highlight the Belgian's involvement in the German Deutsche Werkbund, examining his modernist Workers' Theater, built for the 1914 Werkbund Fair in Cologne, as well as his opposition to Muthesius' demand for govenment-imposed standardization of structural elements in German design and architecture.

This will show where limits in global resources are met and where limits in the data fed to the model until now are met. Results from the modelling are global and regional energy consumption, emission of greenhouse gasses and thereby potential increase in global mean temperature. Furthermore, total system costs are compared to a reference scenario. Existing analysis with TIAM shows different ways of reaching the 2 °C target (increase in global mean temperature) and also how uncertainty on different factors influences the optimal solution. The main conclusion from existing analysis with TIAM is that the 2 °C target is possible to reach, but it will be expensive. Another very important point is that if uncertainty on the value of the climate sensitivity (Cs) is taken into account then the optimal strategy calls for early action compared to a full foresight optimisation using the most probable value of Cs. © 2010.","Energy optimisation models; GHG reduction scenarios; Global energy models; Renewable energy; TIAM","Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Optimal systems; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Systems analysis; Energy optimisation; GHG reductions; Global energy; Renewable energies; TIAM; Uncertainty analysis; alternative energy; database; emission control; global perspective; greenhouse gas; model test; renewable resource",,,,,"Connolly, D., Lund, H., Mathiesen, B.V., Leahy, M., A review of computer tools for analyzing the integration of renewable energy into various energy systems (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 1059-1082; (2008), Labriet Maryse, Loulou Richard, Kanudia Amit.

When they have dropped limit notation, forgotten critical modulus signs, mixed up their integrals, muddled up their derivatives, how do you convey to them the importance of recording it right? What of your exasperation as they fail to appreciate the precision that mathematical notation affords them—notation which has been developed and refined over centuries, and notation that will continue to be improved for centuries more. Indeed, mathematics is the one subject in which they can really express exactly what they mean. How can we help them appreciate the symbolism they use? This paper provides a light-hearted look at various notational conventions concerning the derivative. It will briefly cover the various proposals for its symbolic representation over history and the reasons behind the prevalence of the various manifestations over others. The examination of the history of the development of calculus notations is not only fascinating, but suggests a paradigm for the development of future notations. An examination of the reasons behind the failures and successes of past notation can equip one with a certain foresight regarding the future of newly introduced symbols, as particular areas of mathematics expand. This capsule is intended for undergraduate calculus classes and should ideally be offered directly before or after covering the derivative and its various applications, or indeed right in the middle when the students need a bit of a break from theory and practice!

From 1890 attendance at one of several public dispensary practices became a compulsory part of the Edinburgh undergraduate curriculum. As in many UK medical schools, the development of the academic department owed much to the foresight and opportunism of senior academic public health/social medicine physicians. In Edinburgh, Professor Frank Crew recognised that the closure of the public dispensaries at the start of the NHS in 1948 would be an important loss to the education of medical students. In 1947, Richard Scott, then a lecturer in Crew's department and with pre-war experience in general practice, embarked on a project to explore the medical and social needs of families in sickness and in health, and together they sought to establish a ‘laboratory in the community’ to provide teaching to medical students and for long-term studies of illness within families. So, on the first day of the NHS in July 1948, Richard Scott together with a medical assistant, an almoner, a nurse and a dentist set up an NHS practice within the Royal Public Dispensary in West Richmond Street. By 1951 some thirty medical students each year were being provided with a three-month course of clinical instruction, and in 1952 the Rockefeller Foundation offered financial support to aid the development of general practice as an academic discipline. © in this edition Edinburgh University Press, 2011.",,,,,,,"Thomson, D.M., General practice and the edinburgh medical school: 200 years of teaching, care and research (1984) JRCGP, 34, pp. 9-12",,,,"Edinburgh University Press",,,,,,9780748643745; 9780748643561,,,"English","Academic General Practice in the UK Med.

Although aggression-related functional changes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and frontopolar cortex (FPC) have been reported in adults, the neural correlates of aggressive behavior in adolescents, particularly in the context of structural neurodevelopment, are obscure. We used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the blood oxygenation level-depended signal and cortical thickness. In a block-designed experiment, 14-17-year old adolescents imagined aggressive and non-aggressive interactions with a peer. We show reduced vmPFC activation associated with imagined aggressive behavior as well as enhanced aggression-related activation and cortical thinning in the FPC with increasing age. Changes in FPC activation were also associated with judgments of the severity of aggressive acts. Reduced vmPFC activation was associated with greater aggression indicating its normal function is to exert inhibitory control over aggressive impulses. Concurrent FPC activation likely reflects foresight of harmful consequences that result from aggressive acts. The correlation of age-dependent activation changes and cortical thinning demonstrates ongoing maturation of the FPC during adolescence towards a refinement of social and cognitive information processing that can potentially facilitate mature social behavior in aggressive contexts.

The true pacemakers of socialism were not the intellectuals or agitators who preached it but the Vanderbilts, Carnegies and Rockefellers. Joseph A. Schumpeter For Joseph Schumpeter, the heart of the capitalist system was the entrepreneur – an extraordinary individual who had the foresight to see profit in new products or production processes as well as the tenacity to overcome any obstacles that stood in the way. Schumpeter believed that the rise of large firms in the early 20th century was making the entrepreneur obsolete. By investing in in-house research and development (R&D) laboratories staffed by teams of engineers and scientists, large firms had routinized the process of innovation, “depersonalized and autonomatized” technological change, so that the incremental advances were realized “as a matter of course.” In such an environment not only did “personality and will power,” and thus the entrepreneur, “count for less,” but the greater efficiency of large-scale enterprises was undermining the small- and medium-size firms that historically had been the spawning ground for heroic innovators with radically new ideas about how to do things. These developments, Schumpeter foretold, would have profound consequences for the entire society. Because entrepreneurs were the primary political supports for “private property and free contracting,” their eclipse would pave the way for socialist revolution. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,,,,,"Schumpeter, J.A., (1950) Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, p. 134. , 3rd ed.

Yield reductions may range from 2% to 40% (8% in average). This leads to increasing starvation of people, where only in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) the number of hungry people reached 212 million. In Ethiopia about 90% of arable lands is in mountainous areas, where live 90% of the human population and 60% of all livestock. The highlands exposed to improper agricultural practices has been heavily degraded in the last century. The country faces environmental challenges such as land degradation, limited quantity and quality of water resulting from progressive deforestation, improper agricultural practices and urbanization. Similar problems are touching other African countries, especially in the East Africa. To overcome these problems, efforts have been made to launch afforestation and conservation programs; however, success to date has been limited. Harmonization of ecohydrological principles with the existing efforts has been planned. The Gumera River basin has been chosen to be one of the ecohydrological demonstration sites. The Kenyan-Tanzanian border area is also an area of interest due to the large seasonal migrations of large mammals depending on water availability. Lake Naivasha in Kenya is used to demonstrate possible measures for restoration of land-water ecotone functions of Cyperus papyrus by restoration of hydrological regime in the tributaries deltas. This paper uses three cases to discuss the importance of ecohydrology for problem solving in Africa. Establishment of the regional centre for ecohydrology is being proposed.","foresight; integrated models of sustainable management","afforestation; agricultural practice; deforestation; desertification; ecohydrology; land degradation; numerical model; soil erosion; sustainable development; tributary; urbanization; Ethiopia; Kenya; Tanzania; Cyperus; Cyperus papyrus; Mammalia",,,,,"Asres, M.T., Awulachew, S.B., SWAT based run off and sediment yield modeling: A case study of the Gumara watershed in the Blue Nile basin (2010) Ecohydrol.

Whilst bio-genetics may be somewhat immutable, we can influence the social and environmental conditions that determine health status. This chapter examines the impacts of climate change super-imposed upon decades of rural neglect, and upon rural living in a naturally difficult environment. The demonstrated manifestations of these are poor health outcomes, which renders rural children in Australia especially vulnerable to climate change. Here we propose to consider the specific features behind this vulnerability. Agriculture in Australia has long faced challenges due to the extreme variability in existing climate. International commodity market fluctuations and policies of economic rationalism have created a set of rural disadvantages that has driven many farmers off the land. Climate change is predicted to further exacerbate this trend by increasing the frequency and intensity of heat waves, droughts, fires and floods. Recent weather patterns indicate that climate science predictions are already emerging. Survival of many rural communities depends upon local agricultural prosperity, such that downturns reverberate throughout regions. Yet despite the charm of country living, rurality has become an un- healthy determinant in Australia, across multiple parameters. Concerns over future viability of farming are generating physical and mental health problems among farming families. Once responsible for Australia's reputation as being the ""lucky country"", Australia's agricultural sector is now in danger of morphing into a ""climate change canary"", an early casualty of climate change. Rural Australia is in real peril, and rural children are especially vulnerable to becoming despondent about their future. Options exist to not only salvage Australia's rural future, but to engage rural communities in mitigation; however this requires commitment to pro-active and pro-rural climate change polices. As of mid 2010, such foresight has yet to appear on the political agenda, instead, we see policies promoting abandonment of rural industries. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Methods: A model of breathing motion uncertainty was derived from previous robust optimization research. We then developed two algorithms ‐ exponential smoothing and running average ‐ to up‐date this model from fraction to fraction, using a sequence of retrospective motion probability mass functions (PMFs) from real patients. A robust optimization problem was solved for each fraction with an updated uncertainty model to generate a sequence of treatments. Delivery of the entire treatment was simulated and dose was accumulated according to the sequence of PMFs. The breathing motion model was created and updated in MATLAB, while CPLEX was used to solve the corresponding robust optimization problem as a linear program. The adaptive robust treatment was then compared with a robust treatment in which the uncertainty set was not updated over the treatment course. Results: Our adaptive robust optimization method exhibited a simultaneous improvement over non‐adaptive robust methods in both tumor coverage and healthy tissue sparing. The adaptive robust treatments were insensitive to the choice of the initial uncertainty model, and also closely comparable to idealized treatments that would be obtained with perfect foresight — i.e., treatments created with a priori knowledge of the entire sequence of future patient PMFs. Conclusions: By combining adaptive radiation therapy and robust optimization, our method combats both the instantaneous breathing motion uncertainty realized in each fraction and changes in the uncertainty that occur from fraction to fraction. Our method demonstrates that it is possible escalate dose to the tumor from the level possible with current robust methods without sacrificing healthy tissue sparing. © 2011, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

This paper is motivated by the remark of Coase that ""although economists claim to study the working of the market, in modern economic theory the market itself has an even more shadowy role than the firm."" It is argued that under conditions of positive transaction costs, incomplete foresight and bounded rationality - the conditions of the New Institutional Economics (NIE) - the institutional framework not only of firms but also of markets matters. Actors who plan to buy or sell a good under conditions of NIE are facing two institutional choice problems: First, to choose or establish a specific market system within which to trade the good and, second, to choose a specific exchange contract. Both are nonmarket coordination problems - the first is a problem of collective action between a multiplicity of suppliers and demanders; the second is a problem of bilateral action: the coordination of individual plans between two parties. Only the first problem is object of this paper. Our hypothesis is that the organization of markets is a collective good, which may be a product of laissez faire or of planned collective action. So far there exists no systematic theory of the NIE of markets, only a number of considerations on specific issues concerning the basic functions of trade, viz., the activities of search, inspection, bargaining, contract execution, control, and enforcement. We content ourselves to describe and comment on some prominent examples from the NIE literature and related approaches to illustrate the kind of considerations that are part of an evolving new institutional economic theory of ""the market itself and argue that, for reasons of the general interest of traders themselves, some forms of planned collective actions are unavoidable.","New institutional economics; Organization of markets; Theory of markets; Transaction costs",,,,,,"Abolafia, M.Y., Structural anarchy: Formal organization in the commodity futures markets (1984) Adler and Adler, pp. 129-149; Akerlof, G.A., The market for 'Lemons': Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, pp. 488-500; Alchian, A.A., Uncertainty, evolution, and economic theory (1950) Journal of Political Economy, 58, pp. 211-221; Alchian, A.A., Woodward, S., Reflections on the theory of the firm (1987) Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics, 143, pp. 110-137; Aoki, M., (2001) Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis, , Cambridge, MA; Arrow, K.J., (1970) Essays in the Theory of Risk-Bearing., , Amsterdam: North-Holland; Arrow, K.J., (1974) The Limits of Organization, , New York & London: Norton; Baharad, E., Eden, B., Price rigidity and price dispersion: Evidence from micro data (2004) Review of Economic Dynamics, 7 (3), pp. 613-641. , DOI 10.1016/j.red.2004.01.004, PII S109420250400016X; Baron, D.P., Private ordering on the internet: The eBay community of traders (2002) Business and Politics, 4 (3), pp. 245-274. , DOI 10.1080/1369525021000158381; Barzel, Y., Measurement cost and the organization of markets (1982) Journal of Law and Economics, 25 (1), pp. 27-48. , DOI 10.1086/467005; Blinder, A.S., Canetti, E.R.D., Lebow, D.E., Rudd, J.B., Asking about prices (1998) A new Approach to Understanding Price Stickiness, , New York: Russell Sage Foundation; Burt, R.S., (1983) Corporate Profits and Cooptation: Networks of Market Constraints and Directorate Ties in the American Economy, , New York: Academic Press; Campbell, J.R., Eden, B., (2005) Rigid Prices: Evidence from U.S. Scanner Data, , http://www.org/publications/workingpapers/wp2005_08.pdf, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Working Paper Series; Carlton, D.W., The rigidity of prices (1986) American Economic Review, 76, pp. 637-658; Coase, R.H., The lighthouse in economics (1974) Journal of Law and Economics, 17, pp. 357-376; Coase, R.H., (1988) The Firm, the Market, and the Law, , Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press; Coleman, J.S., Introducing social structure into economic analysis (1984) American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings, 74, pp. 84-88; Demsetz, H., Information and efficiency: Another viewpoint (1969) Journal of Law and Economics, 12, pp. 1-22; Dimand, R.W., Monetary economics, history of (2008) The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, , 2nd ed., ed.

All human cultures and social groups participate in, and respond to, music and dance. Music can produce a sense of well-being; it induces what are presumed to be beneficial physiological changes in humans. However, what, if any, evolutionary significance did music have for the founder members of our species? Our immediate ancestors must have had complex, mimetic communication skills (Mithen, 2005) and recent studies support the long-standing idea that there was a precursor from which both music and language were derived. But why did modern Homo sapiens retain both communication systems? Music is not usually representational, does not propound theories or testable hypotheses (Storr, 1992). Music is essentially prosodic, ‘emotional’ communication, it entrains neural activity and stimulates our emotions, it can induce whole body autonomic and physiological responses, it forms a major component of ceremony and ritual. Language, on the other hand, is primarily semantic communication; it is symbolic and abstract, generative and referential, it permits intuitive reasoning, it usually possesses past, present and future tenses that enable reflection and facilitate foresight, choice-making, contingency planning, etc. For many, the evolution of language in Homo sapiens is a singular event that is linked to the evolution of the cognitively modern mind. Why, then, alongside language and speech, does music seem to be a ‘specific biological competence’ (Brown, 2000), that has universally remained so for tens of thousands of years, and how is this relevant to the health and welfare of humans in the twenty-first century?In this chapter I will argue that it is because music (and with it dance) promotes the expression and experience of emotions, affects arousal, fosters interactions within groups, that it was of major evolutionary importance in the early history of our species and remains important to us, individually and collectively, today. A considerable body of evidence obtained from numerous laboratories around the world has shown that areas in the human brain associated with positive responses to music overlap with networks associated with reward behaviours and acts of social cooperation. In the specific context of neurotherapy, I propose that these evolutionary considerations and functional brain imaging studies all point to the validity of using music as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of neurological dysfunctions ranging from psychiatric disorders to rehabilitation after trauma. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,,,,,"Altenmüller, E., Marco-Pallares, J., Münte, T.F., Neural reorganization underlies improvement in stroke-induced motor dysfunction by music-supported therapy (2009) The Neurosciences and Music III - Disorders and Plasticity, Annals of the New York Academy of Science, 1169, pp. 395-405; Ambrose, S.H., Late pleistocene human population bottlenecks, volcanic winter, and differentiation of modern humans (1998) Journal of Human Evolution, 34, pp. 623-651; Atkinson, Q.D., Gray, R.D., Drummond, A.J., Bayesian coalescent inference of major human mitochondrial dna haplotype expansions in africa (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 276, pp. 367-373; Benton, A.L., The amusias (1977) Music and the Brain: Studies on the Neurology of Music, pp. 398-422. , Heinemann Medical Books Ltd, London; Bernatzky, G., Bernatzky, P., Hesse, H.-P., (2004), pp. 4-8; Bickerton, D., Language evolution: A brief guide for linguists (2007) Lingua, 117, pp. 510-526; Blood, A.J., Zatorre, R.J., Intensely pleasurable responses to music correlate with activity in brain regions implicated in reward and emotion (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 98, pp. 11818-11823; Blum, K., Chen, T.J., Chen, A.L., Do dopaminergic gene polymorphisms affect mesolimbic reward activation of music listening response?

Thisanniversary is now taken as an opportunity to outline some developments in the researchon hypothalamic GnRH following that. Indisputably, the decapeptide GnRH is still seenas the key hormone of neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction. The successfulisolation of GnRH from animal hypothalami in the early seventies was followed by thedevelopment of numerous agonists and antagonists. Experimental studies performedworld-wide resulted in a more profound knowledge on the regulative processes ofreproductive function. Novel options arose to treat several forms of infertility and todevelop strategies for population control. Also in animal reproduction, the ability ofGnRH and its analogues to influence the release of the gonadotropins, FSH and LH, isincreasingly used. Examples are treatment of certain hormone-dependent disturbancesand stimulation of the ovulation process in controlled breeding programmes. Numerousschedules have been created to influence the economic gain of livestock production bypro-fertility and anti-fertility measures.Furthermore, the availability of suitable tools for probing the genome and proteomehas allowed more efficiently the rapid discovery of novel genes and peptides that playimportant, previously uncharacterized roles in neuroendocrine regulation. Thus, thediscovery and characterization of a number of natural GnRH variants and their receptorsin several vertebrate and invertebrate species may become increasingly important. Thereason is that these peptides show additional effects by transmitting seasonal and nutritivesignals to reproductive organs. Besides these decapeptides, like chicken GnRH-II orlamprey-III GnRH, members of another group of peptides, the RF amides, were recentlyexplored that can also exert stimulating or inhibiting effects on the release ofgonadotropins. These compounds with the characteristic amino acid sequence Arg-Phe attheir carboxy terminus are thought to be involved in the hypothalamo-pituitarianfeedback of ovarian steroids. Recent results suggest a special role for the 145-amino-acidpeptide Kisspeptin, which is affecting across its receptor GPR54. It is more and moreseen as a mediator for signals from other endogenous GnRH secretagogues and metabolichormones like insulin and leptin. Research activities have been started to explore theseeffects when studying puberty, ovulation, placenta function or sexual behavior in themale.In conclusion, new findings on GnRH and other hypothalamic peptides demonstratedthe foresight to appreciate the scientific and medical importance of these compounds.Moreover, it opened the door for numerous, still currently non-assessable effective andanimal friendly applications in livestock production. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is a methodology which focuses on the territory as a social construct meaning a dynamic space where different types of ""capital"" converge (natural, human, social, institutional). This allows the analysis of different scales, taking into account the global visions and identities, the relationships of legitimacy, the game of power and interests of various stakeholders, the demands for participation, the ethical considerations and factors of change. It is a tool which provides a comprehensive, systemic and foresight perspective in seeking ways to balance environmental and social equity. From this perspective, energy issues can be seen as integrated into the territory on both demands and problems, but also opportunities and potential for change. The analysis of energy issues with this methodology offers the following advantages: an assessment of renewable resources, visualization of the energy demand in all its complexity, incorporating perspectives and views of local stakeholders, identification of priorities, possibility of planning short and long term proposals and actions. How can you integrate the concept of energy into the land use planning approach? The answer is found by reviewing the three main stages of this methodology: defining objectives, evaluating course of action and implementation. First, it is necessary to define the ""sustainable"" from the conceptual and pragmatic point of view, taking into account the aspirations, ideals and realities of a given territory. This allows the identification of the desired scenario, itself a synthesis of what is needed, what is expected and what needs to be achieved. Thus, different sectors that are part of the territory stand for different interests as well as for various energy demands. However, it is imperative to identify the commonalities and core issues from which agreements must be built: the need to improve life quality, reduce negative environmental impacts, improving efficiency in production processes, etc. Secondly, there are several options to evaluate in order to meet priorities. In this regard, Multi criteria Evaluation Methodologies become a real option since they develop a unique variable system that combines qualitative and quantitative data, integrates multi-sectorial and multi-disciplinary approaches as well as spatial models based on GIS (Geographic Information Systems). Thirdly, top priority and optimal actions have been identified and they need to be implemented. Thus, maps of capacity and allocation of uses define preferred locations for activities. In relation to these preferences and uses, energy analysis can define applications of renewable energy and energy efficiency policies, with better prospects for its implementation. Finally, decisions must be translated into direct action tools for the construction of the new scenario. Strategic planning is viewed, in this context, as the main interactive tool for change. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Hamm. In July 1774, Johnson embarked on a tour of North Wales with his close friends, Henry and Hester Thrale. Johnson organized the first segment of the trip, and their first stop was his birthplace, Lichfield. While in Lichfield, the group visited apothecary Richard Greene's museum of antiquities and natural curiosities; had lunch with one of the founding members of the Lunar Society, Erasmus Darwin; called on the “Swan of Lichfield,” the poet Anna Seward, Darwin's friend and first biographer; and visited Andrew Newton's collection of East Indian rarities. After an eventful three days, the group set out for an eleven-day stay with Johnson's schoolmate and close friend, Dr. John Taylor. During their visit, they made excursions to view country seats (the Duke of Devonshire demonstrated his mechanical fountain for them), examined hot springs, explored underground rivers and caves, and inspected a silk mill, where Johnson “remarked a particular manner of propagating motion from a horizontal to a vertical wheel” (Works, 1:163-70). Add electricity and chemistry-made familiar to the Thrales by way of Johnson's experiments in the laboratory they set up at Streatham-and these two weeks constitute a Grand Tour of eighteenth-century science and its practical applications. Scientific developments Their immersion in science and technology at Lichfield was far from coincidental: by the 1770s, Johnson's birthplace had become a hotbed of experimentation and technological development. Situated in the English West Midlands just north of the industrial center of Birmingham, Lichfield emblematized the eighteenth-century drive to harness scientific knowledge for practical purposes. A group of the most important figures in “applied science” had gathered there and formed the Lunar Society: James Watt, inventor of the first commercially viable steam engine to power foundries and ironworks; silversmith Matthew Boulton, founder of the Soho Mint and manufacturer of Watt's steam engine; potter Josiah Wedgwood, producer of the first bone china in Britain and inventor of the pyrometer (a thermometer used to measure extreme temperatures inside a kiln or furnace); clockmaker turned geologist John Whitehurst; natural philosopher and theologian Joseph Priestley, who wrote extensively on electricity, optics, theology, rhetoric, and, most famously, “dephlogisticated air,” now known as oxygen; Erasmus Darwin, physician, botanical poet, proponent of evolutionary theory, and grandfather of Charles Darwin; and physician William Withering, an amateur geologist, author of a botanical guide to British flora, and discoverer of digitalis, a medicine for the treatment of congestive heart failure. As the wide array of pursuits in this small group of men indicates, science had yet to fragment into the specialized disciplines we know today: chemists studied physics, mechanical engineers dabbled in mineralogy, and doctors were as likely to invent a device for predicting the weather as to discover a new medicine. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,,,,,"Davie, D., The Language of Science and the Language of Literature, 1700-1740 (2003) A Traveling Man: Eighteenth-Century Bearings, pp. 47-82. , (Manchester: Carcanet); Golinski, J., (1992) Science as Public Culture: Chemistry and Enlightenment in Britain, 1760-1820, , (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); Porter, R., (2003) The Cambridge History of Science, the Eighteenth Century, 4. , (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); Schwartz, R.B., (1971) Samuel Johnson and the New Science, , (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press); Uglow, J., (2002) The LunarMen: The Friends Who Made the Future, 1730-1810, , (London: Faber & Faber); Sloane, H., (1753) The Will ofSirHans Sloane, pp. 28-29. , (London); Wilson Peale, C., (1983) The Selected Papers of Charles Wilson Peale, 2, pp. 265-274. , L.

Improved crop protection strategies to prevent such damage and loss can increase production and make a substantial contribution to food security. DNA-based technologies are likely to greatly increase the speed, sensitivity and accuracy of pest and pathogen detection and diagnosis. Rapid sequencing of nucleic acids from infected plants will aid identification of novel disease agents. Biomarkers of disease or crop damage such as volatile chemicals or blends may also be used to detect pest outbreaks. Biosensors coupled to information networks will provide real-time monitoring and surveillance of crops or stored produce and hence early warning of emerging problems and new invasive species. Challenges remain in the dissemination of new technologies and information to resource poor farmers in developing countries, although the rapid extension of the internet, mobile phones and other communication networks will provide new opportunities. Defining the genetic and molecular basis of innate plant immunity has been a major advance in plant biology with the potential to identify new targets for intervention via novel chemistry or genetic modification (GM). Identification of regulatory genes, signal molecules, pathways and networks controlling induced plant defence should lead to the development of a new generation of defence modulators, delivered either as crop protection products, or via biological agents on seeds or in the root zone. There should also be opportunities to select more responsive crop genotypes, or to develop transgenic crops tailored to respond to specific chemical cues or molecular patterns diagnostic for particular biotic threats. Sequencing of the genomes of the major crop species and their wild relatives will expand enormously the known gene pool and diversity of genetic resources available for plant breeders to access. It should be possible to identify genomic regions and genes conferring more durable, quantitative resistance to pathogens. The breeding cycle will be accelerated by high-throughput phenotyping and more efficient selection of resistance traits using within-gene markers. GM approaches will facilitate pyramiding (combining) resistance genes with different specificities and modes of action, thereby reducing the risk of directional selection for virulence. Analysis of the genomes of plant pathogens and invertebrate pests is already providing new information on genes, gene families and processes involved in host colonization and pathogenicity. Comparative genomics of species with diverse host ranges, contrasting feeding habits and different pathogenic lifestyles will identify new targets for inhibiting pest attack and aid the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and pesticides. Understanding the natural ecology of pests and pathogens, such as the factors determining host location, resource exploitation and interactions with other organisms, will improve our ability to manipulate behaviour, or exploit natural enemies or other antagonists of pest species. Volatile signals, either from natural plant sources, or engineered in transgenic crops, will be more widely used to modify pest behaviour. It may also be possible to manipulate microbial communities regulating pathogen populations and activity, and thereby recruit and retain more effective biocontrol agents. Insights into the natural diversity and activity of soil and microbial populations in the zones surrounding roots and seeds will provide new information on mechanisms of suppression regulating pest species. Fully effective interventions are unlikely, due to the complexity and diversity of the soil system, but there should be progress towards integrated control regimes combining more resistant crop genotypes (either selected or GM) with targeted management of natural suppressive processes. Harnessing new technologies and knowledge to create more durable resistant crops and sustainable disease and pest management systems will require improved understanding of the factors driving pest and pathogen adaptation and evolution. There must also be an increased emphasis on translational research and delivery, and developing strategies appropriate for lower-input production systems, if the second ‘green revolution’ is to become a reality. © 2010, Cambridge University Press.
