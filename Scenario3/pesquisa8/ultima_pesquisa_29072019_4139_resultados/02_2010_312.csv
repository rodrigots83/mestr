The complex origins of impulsivity hinder identification of the genes influencing it and the diseases with which it is associated. Here we perform exon-focused sequencing of impulsive individuals in a founder population, targeting fourteen genes belonging to the serotonin and dopamine domain. A stop codon in HTR2B was identified that is common (minor allele frequency >1%) but exclusive to Finnish people. Expression of the gene in the human brain was assessed, as well as the molecular functionality of the stop codon, which was associated with psychiatric diseases marked by impulsivity in both population and family-based analyses. Knockout of Htr2b increased impulsive behaviours in mice, indicative of predictive validity. Our study shows the potential for identifying and tracing effects of rare alleles in complex behavioural phenotypes using founder populations, and indicates a role for HTR2B in impulsivity. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A; dopamine; serotonin; serotonin 2B receptor; gene expression; hormone; molecular analysis; neurology; phenotype; population genetics; psychology; rodent; suicide; violence; alcoholism; animal experiment; article; controlled study; female; gene frequency; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic predisposition; human; impulsiveness; knockout gene; knockout mouse; major clinical study; male; mouse; nonhuman; population genetics; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; stop codon; Animals; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cell Line; Female; Finland; Founder Effect; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genotype; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Male; Mental Disorders; Mice; Mice, 129 Strain; Mice, Knockout; Pedigree; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2B; Testosterone; Mus",,"dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; serotonin, 50-67-9; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2B; Testosterone, 58-22-0",,,"Winstanley, C.A., Eagle, D.M., Robbins, T.W., Behavioral models of impulsivity in relation toADHD: Translation between clinical and preclinical studies (2006) Clin.

In this paper, we explore the consequences of relaxing the rational expectations assumption usually taken in this type of model; in particular, by considering expectations formed through adaptive learning, it is possible to arrive to results other than the trivial convergence to a fixed point long-term equilibrium. The results involve the possibility of endogenous cyclical motion (periodic and a-periodic), which emerges essentially in scenarios of hyperinflation. In low inflation settings, the introduction of learning implies a less severe impact of monetary shocks that, nevertheless, tend to last for additional time periods relative to the pure perfect foresight setup. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

The foresight is based on prominent forecasting studies of scholars and a leading British company. This research assumes that converging nano-bio-info-cogno technologies are the foundation of 5th and 6th Kondratieff waves, whereas the future technological revolution that may underpin the 7th economic long wave is assumed to be Faster-Than-Light (FTL) Technologies. The positive effects of these next technological revolutions on worldwide economic system are a high increase in productivity, employment rate, consumption and economic growth that lead to longer, happier and healthier living as well as general well-being.

Recent research has documented various links between the ability to construct episodes of the past and imagine potential future episodes, and it has been argued that the former may be a design feature of the latter. Thus, claims about the existence of episodic memory in non-verbal organisms may be evaluated by examining behavioural evidence for foresight. Here we review recent data on foresight in animals and conclude that the evidence to suggest episodic memory so far is equivocal. We suggest specific experimental criteria that could provide stronger evidence. We maintain that there must be uniquely human traits for which there are no animal models and it remains possible that mental time travel depends on several such traits. Identification of what precisely is unique about the human capacity and what is not, can inform us about the nature and evolution of the human capacities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Episodic memory; Episodic-like memory; Foresight; Memory systems; Mental time travel; Planning; Prospection; Www-memory","animal behavior; article; biological trait; episodic like memory; episodic memory; evolution; foresight; futurology; mental function; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; thinking; time; travel; Animals; Anticipation, Psychological; Consciousness; Humans; Mental Recall; Models, Animal",,,,,"Suddendorf, T., Corballis, M.C., The evolution of foresight: what is mental time travel and is it unique to humans?

This paper explores what happens when forecasts of robotic technology meets the practice of sterile supply in a preliminary stage of an ongoing project. We examine the nature of participation in design on three levels: in the sterilization ward, this particular project and society in general. From our case, we suggest that while innovation projects proceeding from a certain technological perspective can succeed at building excitement, the most sustainable innovation stems from the dialogical interaction between practitioner foresight and societal forecasting, requiring continued development of participatory design as it moves into new contexts.

Most other planning techniques are either aimed at specialized types of construction work (such as linear scheduling) or are peripheral tools to be used conjunctively (such as nD-CAD). Discrete-event simulation has also been used for construction planning, and while it is extremely versatile, it lacks the simplicity in use of CPM and so has not been widely adopted within the industry. This paper goes back to first principles, identifying the needs of construction project planning and how existing tools meet (or fail to meet) these requirements. Based on this, it proposes a new modeling paradigm, Foresight, better suited to contemporary construction project planning. The principles of the method and its relative merits are demonstrated relative to conventional simulation in a series of construction case studies. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Activity network; Construction planning; Construction projects; Construction works; Critical path method; Discrete events; First-principles; Graphical constraints; Modeling paradigms; Planning techniques; Computer aided design; Electrostatic discharge; Turnaround time; Construction industry",,,,,"Ceric, V., Hierarchical Abilities of Diagrammatic Representations of Discrete-Event Simulation Models (1994) Proceedings of the 1994 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 589-594. , eds.

Sweden's high reliance on foreign energy supply and the lack of domestic fossil energy sources hit private motoring hard. In the aftermath of the crisis, methanol was seen as a promising alternative fuel. This article analyzes how, who, and for what reasons methanol fuel was promoted in Sweden in the 1970s and early 1980s. Furthermore, the study places the efforts to establish methanol as fuel in an international framework and in the broader context of the Energy Program and the government's objective to plan for a new energy future for Sweden. This article especially examines forecasting motor fuels and automobiles and how foresight was used in relation to the methanol campaign. The article argues that in the case of the Swedish methanol campaign the upcoming development in the energy sector was mostly described as smooth and calculable. Both the state and the industry planned for a post-petroleum era, in which methanol fuel played a vital role.

In order to elaborate a model suitable for forecasts and recommendations we have defined eight to ten major elements of an IS that characterise its evolution in an adequate way, such as population and its demographics, legal system and IS policies, IT in use, etc. The evolution of the IS is then modelled as a discrete-continuous or discrete-event system, where the mutual impacts of each of the elements are represented within state-space models. Technological trends form inputs, while feedback loops allow us to model the influence of technological demand on IT, R&D, production, and supply. The technological characteristics of the IS evolution modelled in this way can provide clues to IT providers about future demand. They can also give R&D and educational institutions some idea on the most likely directions of development and demand for IT professionals. As an example, we will model the evolution of decision-support systems and their impact on technological progress, consumption patterns and social behaviour in Poland. The results presented here constitute a methodological input to an IS/IT foresight exercise carried out in Poland during the period 2010-2012 and financed by the ERDF.

All clinicians do this (sometimes several times a 'shift') yet it is exceedingly rare that this skill is even taught or evaluated in any of the health professions, much less evaluated (in situ) in multi-disciplinary care settings. Most of the literature on patient handovers to date has recommended normative checklists, and has generally ignored cognitive and social human factors and the joint role(s) which clinicians have in the creation of resilience and patient safety. The purpose of this research is to discover ""what techniques do ICU clinicians report that they use to develop their intuition and foresight at CoSR in ICU?"" This original qualitative research has found that ICU clinicians (doctors, nurse coordinators and respiratory therapists) agree that face to face communication at CoSR is crucial and that these handoffs reinforce; interdependence, a common mental model and shared peer expectations. This may have important implications for multidisciplinary work in healthcare, if expertise is interpreted as learning how to perceive. Training in healthcare has typically been profession specific, applying knowledge, rules, facts, procedures and clinical guidelines. This research found that ICU workers demonstrate the features of experts where anticipation, effective communication, listening, confirmation and the collaborative creation of patient safety is imperative. During change of shift report, these ICU experts anticipate, monitor, respond and learn, demonstrating the four key components of resilience.

VOs are normally not created from scratch, but instantiated from a strategic network or pool of enterprises. This enhances the preparedness of participating members when an E-Business opportunity occurs. The underlying strategic network acts as a breeding environment for the VOs. Therefore, it is called a VO Breeding Environment (VBE). Examples from the automotive industry are illustrating the development and needs of this concept. Strategic planning is important for such a network in order to increase chances of occurring business opportunities. The remainder of this chapter shows how scenario-oriented methods such as cross-impact analysis can be used to support a collaborative strategic planning in such networked organisations. The application of such methods allows long-term foresight and the anticipation of the right technological, financial and business oriented decisions. © 2011, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"(2002) Annual Report 2002, , http://www.acs-giz.si/pic/pdf/Letno-porocilo-(Annual-report)-2002.pdf, ACS, WWW [Online].

Robots in elder care can be used (i) to assist the elderly and their carers; (ii) to monitor the health and safety of old people, and (iii) to provide them with companionship. Although robots could be usefully employed in each of these areas, there is a need to ensure that they actually benefit the old people themselves, and not just their carers. We discuss a number of ethical concerns and argue that, if introduced with foresight and careful guidelines, robots and robotic technology could improve the lives of the elderly.

The network is comprised of the macrocells underlaid with femtocells. The objective of each station in the network is to maximize its capacity under power constraints. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game with the macrocell base stations as the leaders and the femtocell access points as the followers. The leaders are assumed to have enough information and foresight to consider the response of the followers while formulating their strategies. To characterize such interaction between leaders and followers, Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced; and it is shown to exist under the assumption of continuity of best response function of the leader sub-game. ©2010 IEEE.","Cellular network; Femtocell; Game theory; Stackelberg equilibrium","Access points; Best response; Cellular network; Downlink power allocation; Femtocell; Macro cells; Power constraints; Stackelberg equilibrium; Stackelberg Games; Cellular neural networks; Game theory; Mobile telecommunication systems; Telecommunication; Wireless networks",,,,,"Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Gatherer, A., Femtocell networks: A survey (2008) Comm.

We propose a novel explanation for this dispersion: the coupling of dealers' unwillingness to hold inventory with dealers' imperfect foresight concerning future prices and/or random lead times when "" ordering"" drugs from higher-level suppliers. Unwillingness to hold inventory means drug markets might operate consistent with a cobweb model. The classic cobweb model was inspired by the observation of cyclic (typically annual) fluctuations in commodity prices. However, with minor changes that make the model more realistic the resulting price trajectories can be highly variable or even chaotic, not just periodic. Cobweb dynamics can also amplify the variability created by supply chain disruptions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Chaos; Cobweb model; Drug markets; Drug policy; Price dispersion","chaos theory; chaotic dynamics; commodity price; economic theory; numerical model; price dynamics; theoretical study",,,,,"(2010) Guidelines for collecting data on retail drug prices in Europe: issues and challenges, , EMCDDA, Lisbon, European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction; (2009) Understanding illicit drug markets, supply reduction efforts, and drug-related crime in the European Union, , RAND, Cambridge U.K. B.

In the information age military force is used to influence the intentions of people. Globalisation and networking of operational environments constantly change the traditional order of management. Military organisations are challenged to behave more dynamically and to enhance the knowledge base being more multidisciplinary and agile. The societies today are ""systems of systems"", i.e. complex interactive human-technological systems forming various dynamic multidimensional networks. Thus, the complexity of interactions can only be tracked using conditional probabilities. This makes the decision-making of operations all the more dependent on tacit knowledge of the officers all through the various levels of command-and-control. Human behaviour cannot be forecast in detail, since people can change their rules of interaction thus changing expected outcome. In the past, the general understanding of ontology has been that there are two - order and chaos. Recently the third ontology - complexity - has emerged in scientific approach. In complex systems there is order, but it is emergent rising from the local interaction of independent actors, each of whom behaves according to its own principles, logic and knowledge. The behaviour of complex evolving systems and organisations arises from the intricate interconnectivity of elements - independent actors - within the system and between the system and its operational environment. In this paper, the futures research methodology for creating alternative futures images of information wars is presented. There are recent major efforts to upgrade foresight methodologies available for the global community, such as organisational complexity, six-to-seven pillars of futures methods, HIF-analysis (Hindsight/Insight/Foresight), sense-making and Futures Signals Sense-making Framework (FSSF). Furthermore, to enhance the understanding of network-centric behaviour the new network theories are discussed. In particular, the varying error tolerance of networks is of interest.","Complexity; Futures; Networks; Robustness; Sense-making; Warfare","Command-and-control; Complexity; Conditional probabilities; Error tolerance; Evolving systems; Futures; Global community; Globalisation; Human behaviours; Information age; Information war; Interconnectivity; Knowledge base; Local interactions; Military force; Network-centric; Operational environments; Research methodologies; Sensemaking; Systems of systems; Tacit knowledge; Knowledge based systems; Military operations; Networks (circuits); Robustness (control systems); Societies and institutions",,,,,"Aaltonen, M., Allowing complexity into the puzzle of strategic sensemaking (2003) Eve: Organisational Complexity, , http://www.tse.fi/FI/yksikot/erillislaitokset/tutu/Documents/ publications/tutu_2003-6.pdf, Keskinen, Auli and Aaltonen, Mika and Mitleton-Kelly, Foreword by Stuart Kauffman, FFRC Publications 6/2003, Finland, 14-38; Aaltonen, M., The third lens (2007) Multi-ontology Sense-making and Strategic Decision-making, p. 145. , Ashgate, UK; Albert, R., Jeong, H., Barabási, A.-L., Error and attack tolerance of complex networks (2000) Macmillan Magazines, 406. , http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6794/full/406378a0.html, 27 July, 2000; Barabási, A.-L., Bonabeau, E., (2003) Scale-Free Networks, , http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=scale-free-networks, May 2003; Candolin, C., (2005) Securing Military Decision Making in a Network-Centric Environment, p. 141. , http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2005/isbn9512279819/, TKK/Dissertations 20, Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory for Theoretical Computer Science, Espoo; Cebrowski, A.K., Garstka, J.J., (1998) Network-Centric Warfare: Its Origin and Future, pp. 1-139. , http://www.kinection.com/ncoic/ncw_origin_future.pdf, US Naval Institute, Proceedings, Jan, Col 124/1, 1998; Enger, P.I., Terrorism as information warfare (2005) Struggling to Understand Information War, pp. 31-42. , in Kuusisto, Rauno and Rantapelkonen, Jari (eds.), Publication Series 2, Article Collection, Dept. of Leadership and Management Studies and Dept. of Tactics and Operations Art, National Defence University, Helsinki; (2003) Practical Guide to Regional Foresight, , http://cordis.europa.eu/foresight/cgrf.htm, EU/DG Research 20478, EU Commission, EUR 20478, Brussels; Glenn, J., (2009) State of the Future, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFlkaRMCqlg&feature=sdig&et= 1259280513.44, Authors@Google, Google's Mountain View Office, USA, 24.

This chapter focuses purely on the technical nature of cyberattacks. It examines the current relationship between networked systems and cybercrimes, analyzes the nature of the relationship from a fundamental engineering perspective, and explores systematically where and how future advances in networked systems might influence the evolution of cyberattacks, even inadvertently giving rise to new forms of cybercrimes. Historical data reveals that technological advances in engineering systems design, including communications and transportation, were often accompanied by lack of foresight, thereby inadvertently opening doors to new forms of vulnerabilities following deployment. The greater the extent of the advancement, the deeper the potential chasm and more severe the damage incurred when a clever perpetrator successfully exploits the weaknesses. For example, when the Bell Telephone System employed human operators to switch telephone calls in the early 1900s, anonymous and unauthorized long distance calls were a rarity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,,,,"(2001) Hackers: Computer Outlaws, , The Learning Channel, July 25, Cable Television; Pillalamarri, S., Ghosh, S., The impact of source traffic distribution on quality of service (QoS) in ATM networks (2001) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, pp. 2855-2859. , June 11-15; Lessig, W., (2001) The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in the Connected World, , New York, NY: Random House; Ghosh, S., (2002) Principles of Secure Network Systems Design, , April, New York, NY: Springer; Annual International Working Conference on Active Networks, , http://www.iwan2002.org, Retrieved December 4-6, 2002, from; Ghosh, S., Computer virus attacks on the rise: Causes, mitigation, and the future (2002) Financial IT Decisions 2002, 1, pp. 16-17. , http://www.wsta.org;, 1, Feb/Mar, a Bi-Annual Technology Publication of the Wall Street Technology Association, Red Bank, New Jersey.

As a result, only three possibilities are admissible in terms of long-term dynamics: the equilibrium may be a stable node, an unstable node or a saddle point. Fixed point stability (a stable node) is generally guaranteed for an active monetary policy rule. The benchmark model also considers extremely simple assumptions about expectations (perfect foresight is frequently assumed). In this paper, one inquires how a change in the way inflation expectations are modelled implies a change in monetary policy results, when an active Taylor rule is considered. By assuming that inflation expectations are constrained by the evolution of the output gap, we radically modify the implications of policy intervention: endogenous cycles, of various periodicities, and chaotic motion will be observable for reasonable parameter values.","Endogenous business cycles; Inflation expectations; Monetary policy; Nonlinear dynamics and chaos; Taylor rule",,,,,,"Akerlof, G., Dickens, W., Perry, G., Options for Stabilization Policy (2001) The Brookings Institution Policy Brief, 69, pp. 1-8; Akerlof, G., Yellen, J., Can Small Deviations from Rationality Make Significant Differences to Economic Equilibria?

The attributes of human living today and the manner in which the modern societies and organizations are formed indicate a remarkable difference in comparison to the early days of civilizations. As much as modern living becomes very much technology driven and ICT based, it also contributes actively to make it more complex, connected, and exposed. This brings completely new set of dimensions to shape up the future of humans, societies, and organizations. With reference to years of observations and experiences on the aggressive and rapid technological & ICT-based developments, this paper brings the future of human, social, and organizational issues into perspective. It also elaborates on the critical features of the transformations that are conditioned by the attributes of living with modern and emerging technologies. © 2010 IEEE.","Digital technologies; Human evolutions; Organizational changes; Smart work place; Social transformations; Technology risk","Digital technologies; Human evolution; Organizational changes; Smart work place; Social transformation; Technology risk; Management; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Information technology",,,,,"Hosny, Y.A., Khalil, T.M., (2004) Management of Technology - Internet Economy: Opportunities and Challenges for Developed and Developing Regions of the World, , Elsevier; During, W., Oakey, R., Kauser, S., (2004) New Technology-based Firms in the New Millennium, 3. , Elsevier; Gunasekaran, A., Khalil, O., Rahman, S.M., (2003) Knowledge and Information Technology Management: Human and Social Perspective, , Idea Group Publishing; Eason, K., (1988) Information Technology and Organizational Change, , Taylor & Francis; Liyanage, J.P., Langeland, T., Smart assets through digital capabilities (2008) Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, pp. 3480-3485. , Mehdi Khosrow-Pour (ed.), IGI Global, USA; Liyanage, J.P., Bjerkebæk, E., Use of advanced technologies and information solutions for north sea offshore assets: Ambitious changes and socio-technical dimensions (2007) Journal of International Technology and Information Management (JITIM), pp. 1-10; Liyanage, J.P., Herbert, M., Harestad, J., Smart integrated e-operations for high-risk and technologically complex assets: Operational networks and collaborative partnerships in the digital environment (2006) Supply Chain Management: Issues in the New Era of Collaboration and Competition, pp. 387-414. , J.P.

In this paper, a novel Martingale approach to dynamically monitoring overall network health, based upon the exploitation of a Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, is proposed. Incorporating a Martingale framework for nodal response as an integral calculation of current network statistics allows local nodal decisions to become progressively more accurate as the network life increases and the rigid constraints to power become inescapable. Hence, nodes become increasingly aware of the network conditions, based upon the current environment as well as a priori statistics, and have the ability to react with more foresight. Simulations and analysis show that this framework for sensor nodal decisions has several advantages compared with an existing learning automation approach in different fading channel environments. © 2010 IEEE.","Channel utilization; Cognitive network; Martingale framework; Quality of Services; Wireless sensor networks","Channel utilization; Cognitive network; Integral calculations; Learning automation; Martingale framework; Network condition; Network scalability; Network statistics; Resource limitations; Rigid constraint; Decision making; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Quality control; Quality of service; Sensors; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,"Han, Z., Poor, V., Coalition games with cooperative transmission: A cure for the curse of boundary nodes in selfish packet-forwarding wireless networks (2009) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 57 (1), pp. 203-213. , January; Ho, S., A martingale framework for concept change detection in time-varying data streams (2005) Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Machine Learning, , Bonn, Germany, August; Leone, P., Rolim, J., Towards a dynamical model for wireless sensor networks (2005) Theoretical Computer Science, 344 (1), pp. 69-85. , DOI 10.1016/j.tcs.2005.06.027, PII S0304397505003762, Algorithmic Aspects of Wireless Sensor Networks; Tian, H., Jiang, F., Cheng, W., A game theory based load- balancing routing with cooperation stimulation for wireless ad hoc networks (2009) 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, , June; Ilyas, M.U., Radha, H., End-to-end channel capacity of a wireless sensor network under reachback (2006) 40th Annual Conference on Information Systems, pp. 1713-1718. , March; Huang, J., Han, Z., Chiang, M., Poor, V., Aution-based resource allocation for cooperative communications (2008) IEEE Jouranal on Selected Areas in Communications, 26 (7). , September; Baldo, N., Zorzi, M., Cognitive network access using fuzzy decision making (2009) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 8 (7), pp. 3523-3529. , July; Islan, M.R., Kim, J., Capacity and BER analysis for Nakagami-n channel in LDPC coded wireless sensor network (2008) ISSNIP, , December; Harada, H., Kawahara, R., Mori, T., Kamiyama, N., Hasegawa, H., Yoshino, H., A method of detecting network anomalies in cyclic traffic (2008) IEEE GLOBECOM, , November; Li., S.-Y.R., A martingale approach to the study of occurrence of sequence patterns in repeated experiments (1980) The Annals of Probability, 8 (6), pp. 1171-1176; Baros, J., Servetto, S., On the capacity of the reachback channel in wireless sensor networks (2002) Proc.

This paper proposes that a business unit can be managed successfully in short and longer term in its focal contexts as a set of three recursive, competence-based, and process-based systems. Many elements of Stafford Beer's (1985) viable system model along the key competence-based theoretical bases are applied to this system design task. The outcome is an ideal, recursive template for advancing competence-based business management (CBBM) and its conceptual modeling. It is assumed that it is possible to design a business unit as a viable system that is capable of sustaining a separate existence at only three levels of hierarchy, as part of single or multi-business firms. Business-process models and their redesign processes are chosen as the 2nd-order, focal system which produces a business unit's competitiveness and solves longitudinal CBBM problems. One level of recursion down includes a unit's value creating, capturing, relever aging, and respective processes that enable to solve cross-sectional problems. One level of recursion up includes a unit's existential foresights and their crafting processes that solve existential problems. Recursivity is designed inside each system in terms of three kinds of subsystems for (a) primary value relever aging, process-model redesign, and business-foresight crafting, (b) the management of varieties in relever aging, modeling, and foreseeing, and (c) the monitoring and probing of all three systems. Systemic competences are incorporated inside respective systems. Such competences possess three flexibilities of absorption, attenuation, and amplification. At each level of recursion, a competence-based process is a unit of conceptual modeling of CBBM. A business unit is defined as a set of its purposeful processes. No thing or one is left outside them. Viability is ensured by real-time interaction and the 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-order feedback loops between three systems. Overall, the suggested, recursive, 3-system template is intended to serve future, compatible modeling efforts among interested, pioneering firms, professional CBBM modelers, scholars, and alike. Its novelty is produced by choosing and designing the CBBM modeling as the 2nd-order system-in-focus with its two recursions, by designing and using systemic, competence-based processes as the units of conceptualization, and by choosing and drawing the figures to illustrate the 3-system template in the ways that allow also business managers comprehend and apply the suggested template in practice.

It represents a continuing tradition of change and innovation that has been most evident in recent revisions of the scale. This chapter provides an overview of the scale's historical and contemporary foundations. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition reflects the culmination of over 70 years of progressive revisions to the Wechsler line of adult intelligence measures. Wechsler's foresight in defining intelligence in practical terms has allowed the very flexibility needed for ongoing revisions to his intelligence scales in light of advances in theory, research, and the measurement of intelligence. The most recent editions of the Wechsler intelligence scales have involved dramatic changes based on burgeoning research advances in neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, and contemporary intelligence theory, as well as increasing sophistication in psychological measurement. Despite these substantial innovations, some critics perpetuate the myth that the Wechsler intelligence scales are outdated or atheoretical. This chapter elaborates on Wechsler's views about intelligence and the progressive adaptations to his intelligence scales in light of contemporary theory and research. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

When it comes to seeking 'game-changing' advances, the situation is even more challenging. First, research aimed at revolutionary advancements is different from just improving technology. On both the individual and organization level, it is natural to doubt the viability of new, unfamiliar concepts. Foresight is required to extend beyond the known in combination with rigor to make genuine progress. Additionally, such research can span multiple disciplines and different levels of progress and applicability. And lastly, on topics that appear far from fruition, available resources are minimal. To address these challenges and provide insights for managing projects aimed at 'game-changing' advances, historic lessons are compiled and condensed to provide a set of recommendations that include: combining vision and rigor, separate revolutionary research from taking care of existing business, devise separate prioritization criteria, break long-range goals into shorter-term important questions, judge rigor instead of feasibility, define success as gaining reliable knowledge, and embrace failures.

What could policymakers have done to prevent the recent crisis? And once the crisis started, what interventions might have alleviated it? These questions have been widely debated, with an eye to both substantive policy and the design of effective regulatory institutions. This Article speaks to the latter project - one of comparative institutional analysis - though with a framework that implicates our substantive policy choices as well. It begins with an account of financial crises as grounded in the multiple equilibrium character of the financial markets. Given the latter, it suggests, questions of ""salience"" become central to the design of both substantive policy and relevant institutions. To emphasize as much, the Article considers the role of transnational regulatory networks in preventing and responding to financial crises. Drawing on the example of the recently re-formed Financial Stability Board, it highlights certain inherent limits of networks, but also points to institutional reforms that might be expected to enhance their capacity to impact salience - and thereby play a role - in regulating financial crises.",,,,,,,"Kindleberger, C.P., Aliber, R., (2005) Manias, Panics and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, p. 1. , 5th ed; Ahdieh, R.B., The visible hand: Coordination functions of the regulatory state (2010) Minn.

Rev., 123, p. 1151. , At least in part, the tendency to assess solutions separate from causes of the recent crisis might be explained by the tremendous uncertainty about the latter question, see for example, 1198-1200, as well as some related tendency to focus on more tangible predicates, rather than more abstract, root causes, of the financial crisis.

Besides analyses of strategic complementarities and herd behavior, as noted in the text, the distinct study of systemic risk, including by Steven Schwarcz; Schwarcz, S.L., Systemic risk (2008) Geo. L. J., 97, p. 193. , see, might also be seen to turn on the dynamic suggested; See supra notes 37-41 and accompanying text; Spending will often lack the systemic quality prevalent in lending and investment. The confidence that stands behind at least some spending e.g., in continued economic activity and growth, however, may cause it to likewise be dependent on expected spending by others; With the dynamic of systemic risk, see supra note 41, the presence of multiple equilibria turns on the relevant risk trigger having been set off, or not, at any given point in time; argument herein is not that all financial market returns are characterized by such a multiple equilibrium dynamic. But many important strands are; Of course, one might pinpoint the cause of financial crises as whatever it is that leads market participants to conclude that the low-level equilibrium is emerging. From my perspective, the distinction between the latter and my account of cause is primarily semantic. The critical point is that general policies or practices of sub-prime lending and excess risk-taking should not be understood as the cause of financial crises; Sugden, R., A theory of focal points (1995) Econ.

In reply, I will argue that we should draw a distinction between (i) facing stronger temptations to offend when one offended and (ii) acting on stronger temptations in offending. The distinction is analogous to Antony Duff's distinction between having a reason for an action and acting on/for that reason. After drawing the distinction, I will argue that while acting on stronger temptations in offending should be a mitigating factor, facing stronger temptations to offend per se should not be a mitigating factor. Moreover, I will argue that since it is not true that deprived offenders generally act on stronger temptations in offending, social deprivation cannot be defended as a general mitigating plea on the basis that deprived offenders generally act on stronger temptations in offending. © The Author 2010.

The Critical Path Method is the most popular project modeling method in construction since it is simple to use and reasonably versatile. Many other modeling techniques have limited scope, being aimed at specialized types of project, such as linear scheduling which is used for modeling construction work that progresses along a line. Discrete-event simulation is the most versatile of all methods, but it lacks the simplicity in use of CPM and so has not been widely adopted in construction. This paper goes back to first principles, identifying the needs of construction project planning and how existing tools satisfy (and fail to satisfy) these requirements. Based on this, a new modeling paradigm is proposed that is better suited to the needs of contemporary construction project planning. The principles of the system are demonstrated in application to three example construction projects. © 2010 IEEE.","Discreteevent simulation; Interactive modeling; Project planning; Structured modeling; Visualization","Constraint-based; Construction projects; Construction works; Critical path method; First-principles; Graphical approach; Interactive modeling; Modeling method; Modeling paradigms; Modeling technique; Project planning; Structured modeling; Turnaround time; Visualization; Construction industry",,,,,"Flood, I., Issa, R.R.A., Liu, W., A new modeling paradigm for computer-based construction project planning (2006) Proc.

The components interact in such a way as to maintain sets of essential variables to within critical ranges in the face of an externally imposed regime of perturbations. The Daisystat model is presented that bears a number of similarities to Ashby's Homeostat but which can also be considered as a higher dimensional version of the Watson & Lovelock Daisyworld model that sought to explain how homeostasis operating at the planetary scale may arise in the absence of foresight or planning. The Daisystat model features a population of diverse individuals that affect and are affected by the environment in different ways. The Daisystat model extends Daisyworld in that homeostasis is observed with systems comprised of four environmental variables and beyond. It is shown that the behaviour of the population is analogous to the 'uniselector' in the Homeostat in that rapid changes in the population allows the system to 'search' for stable states. This allows the system to find and recover homeostatic states in the face of externally applied perturbations. It is proposed that the Daisystat may afford insights into the evolution of increasingly complex systems such as the Earth system.",,"Earth systems; Environmental variables; Higher-dimensional; Physical devices; Planetary scale; Stable state; Biological systems; Physiology",,,,,"Ashby, W.R., (1956) Introduction to Cybernetics, , Chapman and Hall, London; Ashby, W.R., (1960) Design for a Brain, , Chapman and Hall, London, 2nd edition; Clynes, M., Cybernetic implications of rein control in perceptual and conceptual organization (1969) Annals of New York Academy of Science, 156, pp. 629-670; Di Paolo, E., Noble, J., Bullock, S., Simulation models as opaque thought experiments (2000) Artificial Life VII, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems, pp. 497-506. , Bedau, M.

As such, while world poultry-meat production increased nearly 4% per year during that period, it decreased by 2.3% per year in France, making poultry farmers, public and other private stakeholders worried about the future of poultry farming. To help French stakeholders design their strategies for the future, a technical institute (ITAVI) and a research institute (INRA) conducted a scenario-building exercise. Based on the interviews of stakeholders and an 18 month series of discussions with a Panel of poultry experts, four future scenarios were developed. They go beyond simply extending current trends by taking into account uncertainties such as potential shifts in European policies and regulations, consumer attitudes, and stakeholder strategies. Levers of action were identified by the exploration of different possible futures for poultry in 2025. These strategic options concern the stakeholders' strategies, public policy and research. Although no scenario envisages strong production growth by 2025, all, however, underline the importance of multidisciplinary research to characterize the quality and sustainability of production, and, in turn, to improve competitiveness.",,"Animalia",,,,,"(2001) Les principaux résultats du recensement agricole 2000, p. 90. , Agreste.

The essential features of the model are gradually adjusting wages and prices, perfect foresight on current inflation rates and an adaptive revision of the inflationary climate in which the economy is operating. We compare this approach with the New Keynesian approach with staggered price and wage setting and find that whilst both approaches have common components, they have radically different dynamic implications due to the treatment of the forward-looking part of our wage-price spiral. We show that an estimated version of our model implies local asymptotic stability, due to stable interaction of goods market dynamics with the interest rate policy rule of the central bank, and due to a normal working of a real-wage feedback chain. These results are however endangered when there is a global floor to money wage inflation rates, leading in fact to economic breakdown. In this latter case, the return of some money wage flexibility in deep depressions is of help in restoring the viability of the model, thereby avoiding explosive dynamics and the collapse of the economy.","Complex dynamics; Keynesian dynamics; Persistent business cycles; Wage and price Phillips curves",,,,,,"Asada, T., Chen, P., Chiarella, C., Flaschel, P., AD-AS and the Phillips Curve.

It is assessed by analyzing 22 years of both satellite observations of vegetation activity (e.g. NDVI) and climatic data (precipitation, temperature). The specific influence of non-spatial climatic indices such as NAO and SOI is also addressed. The approaches considered for rainfall forecasting include classical Auto-Regressive Moving-Average with Exogenous Inputs (ARMAX) models and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the so-called Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in particular. The use of neural models is proven to be an adequate mathematical prediction tool in this problem due the non-linearity of the problem. These models enable us to predict, with one month foresight, the general rainfall dynamics, with average errors of 44 mm (RMSE) in a test series of 4 years with a rainfall standard deviation equal to 73 mm. Also, the sensitivity analysis in the neural network models reveals that observations in the status of the vegetation cover in previous months have a predictive power greater than other considered variables. Linear models yield average results of 55 mm (RMSE) although they need a large number of error terms (12) to obtain acceptable models. Nevertheless, they provide means for assessing the seasonal influence of the precipitation regime with the aid of linear dummy regression parameters, thereby offering an immediate interpretation (e.g. coherent maps) of the causality between vegetation cover and rainfall. © 2010, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Adams, J., (2007) Vegetation-Climate Interaction.

However, it has become clear that the effectiveness of NFMA's multiple-use mandate depends on the promulgation of clear regulations to guide its implementation. Recent attempts at regulatory reform have significantly relaxed requirements for forest management, specifically through categorical exclusions for environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Coupled with strict interpretation of what constitutes a cumulative impact, lax NEPA analysis for Forest Plans could result in reduced protection of our National Forests. With the Department of Agriculture currently developing a new planning rule, it is imperative that public comments focus on how best to reinstate environmental protections into forest management. Incorporating both NEPA requirements and Environmental Management System planning in the development of Forest Plans would benefit National Forests by providing detailed, yet flexible, substantive plans for entire forest areas to allow for greater planning foresight and the consideration of all cumulative environmental impacts. The general public can have a significant impact on this new planning rule through public comment.

On many executive boards, a major issue is building organizations that are robust enough to handle to discontinuous change and agile enough to renew their portfolio of strategic resources. This article defines and describes a maturity model of organizational future orientation (OFO), which allows the measurement of the ability of an organization to ensure longterm success and survival. Building on 19 case studies and more than 100 interviews with managers of strategic management, innovation management, corporate development, and corporate foresight, we identify five dimensions and 20 elements that combined capture OFO. By defining four maturity levels for each element, we provide a framework that can be used for benchmarking, improving, and designing OFO practices. We hope that this article will serve as a starting point for a much-needed discussion on how to build more robust and agile organizations. This article also contributes to dynamic-capabilities theory by defining barriers and a process model that illustrates how the elements of OFO need to be combined to create the ability to identify and acquire needed strategic resources. Furthermore, the article shows how OFO contributes to organizational ambidexterity by enhancing the ability to identify discontinuous change and develop radical innovations.","Dynamic capabilities; Environmental scanning; Organizational future orientation","Corporate development; Dynamic capabilities; Environmental scanning; Executive Board; Innovation management; Maturity levels; Maturity model; Process model; Radical innovation; Strategic management; Strategic resource; Management science; Societies and institutions; Research",,,,,,"Rohrbeck, R.; Technische Universitaet Berlin, Department of Technology and Innovation Management, Strasse des 17.

A method was developed for constructing visions of the transport system over the next 50 years. The method was then put into practice, and an experimental vision for the year 2100 was created. As a foundation for this preliminary study, a literature survey was carried out to scan both the relevant future analysis methods and the publications of longterm futures studies, particularly those dealing with transportation. The main future analysis methods and tools that were selected and integrated into the vision building method, and further used while bringing the pilot vision to life, were transition management, PESTE analysis and a futures table. The three-step vision building method consists of the following phases: (1) environmental scanning, (2) building up the futures table and the visions, and (3) description of the visions. As an exercise, a small-scale vision was developed to describe the Finnish transport system in 2100, where a few metropolitan areas define the competitiveness of the entire nation. The experiment proved the three-step method successful. As a result from the preliminary study, a more extensive vision building project using the developed method can be recommended.

It did so particularly at Europe's beginnings, in a context of food shortage that inspired a drive for agricultural production. In the end, however, the CAP became a victim of its own success and occasioned enormous levels of expenditure, particularly in the 1980s when a huge part of the community budget was devoted to it. Hence the reforms successively introduced in 1992,1999 and, most importantly, 2003, aimed largely at revising the forms of assistance given to agricultural production, agricultural pricing policy and the general logic of the programme (lending greater weight to nutritional quality and the sustainable management of the environment). These were tangible reforms produced in tough negotiations and they are due to run until 2013. In this context, and insofar as France is particularly concerned by the CAP, a French interdepartmental working group embarked in 2009/10 on a foresight exercise on the future of the CAP to 2020 - in other words, beyond the 2013 deadline when a new CAP reform falls due. This was under the leadership of Bernard Bourget. After a brief presentation of the approach and method employed, Bourget gives an account here of the main lessons learned from this exercise and, in particular, develops six possible scenarios for the CAP in 2020, depending on various assumptions made about the environment, food needs, support for agricultural incomes and international competition etc.",,,,,,,"http://agriculture.eouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Rapport- cgaaeri880_prospective_pac202o.pdf, Le rapport Prospective «PAC 2020 » peut être consulté sur le site Internet du ministère français de l'Alimentation, de l'Agriculture et de la Pêche; (2008) European Agricultural Policy 2020: The Dutch Outlook, , La Haye : ministère néerlandais de l'Agriculture, de la Nature et de la Qualité alimentaire; Marielle, B.-S., Roy Anne, L.E., Aurélie, T., Territorialiser la politique agricole pour plus de cohésion?

This reflects the particular academic strength of the staff and the situation in which it found itself in the middle to late 1990s. This strategy, developed in the light of a changing environment, focuses in particular on its development of Academic Enterprise (Æ) as a means of promoting better work not only with industry and commerce, but also with other stakeholders, such as those in civil and voluntary organizations, in the community at large, and not least, within the university itself. This chapter condenses findings relating to the development and formative evaluation of more than two hundred case studies of how universities have successfully built mutually beneficial relationships with their local businesses and communities, giving them the confidence to develop, for themselves, successful social and community enterprises. The result is the UPBEAT matrix, a model for transforming traditional academics into enterprising ones. The UPBEAT approach recognizes four underlying skills that are needed to fertilize a novel academic idea, enabling it to bloom in the knowledge economy: business acumen and individual performance are two key skills essential in making any social enterprise work effectively and efficiently; social networking intelligence and foresight enabling skills are also critical to success in today's complex knowledge economy. This chapter demonstrates how the UPBEAT project management matrix helps academics develop and continuously to improve these four skills in parallel. The chapter also briefly illustrates how the tool has been used to achieve success in three quite different social enterprises: Contraception: The Board Game, Community Banks, and Bouncing Higher, a balanced learning approach that helps small businesses become more innovative for wealth creation. © 2010 by Michigan State University Press.

This paper will review the extensive experience-based development of the original T55-L-5 into the first of the marine engines (the TF20) and then through the TF25, TF35, TF40, to today's ETF40B, TF50A and TF60B. Specific improvements and power increases will be described with each significant model revision along with the unique requirements of the air cushion vehicle and similar platforms that were powered by these engines. The specific characteristics that define the TF series engine as proven marine propulsion units will be discussed in each of the subsequent engine models. The paper will show the steady progression of advancement in aerodynamics, materials, temperatures, controls and structures leading to today's next generation engine, the TF60B, with the path to yet higher levels of power for the future. The current evolutionary TF60B engine will be described in terms of architecture and development philosophy highlighting the foresight of the original design to accommodate the increments of growth without significantly increasing the frame size of the gas turbine.

These scenarios have been designed through a foresight exercise conducted by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) as part of the CROSSROAD Project, a support action of the European Commission 7th Framework Programme. After presenting the conceptual framework and methodological approach followed, the main results of the trends analysis conducted as part of the project are discussed. This entails the presentation of societal trends and a deeper analysis of policy and research trends that are considered central for understanding and mapping ICT research for prospective governance and policy modelling. Based on the framework proposed, four internally-consistent views of what the European Information Society might be by 2030 have been designed. The resulting scenarios and the consequent implications for citizens, businesses and public services are then presented. The timeframe in which certain (or all) the elements of the visions will occur are influenced by the technological and societal 'speed of change'. However, considering the unprecedented growth and speed of take up experienced in several research areas under investigation, it is argued that the world we will be living in by 2030 will be radically different from the world we are living in today. Finally, the key areas of expected change and the research challenges identified for building a Digital Europe twenty years from now are presented. © 2010 ACM.","Governance; ICTs; Policy modelling; Research","Conceptual frameworks; European Commission; Governance; ICTs; Information society; Institute for prospective technological studies; Methodological approach; Policy modelling; Public services; Research areas; Research challenges; Research trends; Scenario design; Information technology; Research; Public policy",,,,,"Van Der, D.P., Huijboom, N., The futures of EU-based eGovernment: A scenario-based exploration (2008) Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, p. 221. , HICSS 2008; (2006) Roadmapping EGovernment RTD 2020, , European Commission Visions and Research Measures towards European Citizenship and Innovative Government; Osimo, D., Zinnbauer, D., Bianchi, A., (2007) The Future of EGovernment, an Exploration of ICT-driven Models for the EU in 2020, , European Commission, JRC-IPTS; Punie, Y., Lusoli, W., Centeno, C., Misuraca, G., Broster, D., (2009) The Impact of Social Computing on the EU Information Society and Economy, , European Commission, JRC-IPTS; Punie, Y., Misuraca, G., Osimo, D., (2009) Public Services 2.0: The Impact of Social Computing on Public Services, , European Commission, JRC-IPTS; (2010) Facing the Future: Time for the EU to Meet Global Challenges, , European Commission, JRC-IPTS, FORERA; Tubke, A., Ducatel, K., Gavivan, J.P., Moncada-Paternó-Castello, P., (2001) Strategic Policy Intelligence Intelligence for Policy-making Processes, , European Commission, JRC-IPTS and ESTO (EUR 20137 EN); European challenges and flagships: 2020 and beyond (2009) Report of the ICT Advisory Group (ISTAG), , European Commission, ISTAG DG-INFSO; (2009) Moving the ICT Frontiers: A Strategy for Research on Future and Emerging Technologies in Europe, , European Commission, DG-INFSO [COM(2009 184 final, 20.04.2009]; (2008) Report of the Workshop on ICT for Governance and Policy Modelling, , European Commission, DG-INFSO Brussels, June 2008; (2009) Research in Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities: Indicative Strategic Research Roadmap, pp. 2011-2013. , European Commission, DG Research; (2009) Consultation on the Future EU 2020 Strategy, , European Commission Commission Working Document, [COM(2009) 647 Final], Brussels, 24.11.2009; (2009) Towards the Future Internet: A European Research Perspective, , European Commission (Eds.

The management of uncertainty in the development of technological innovations was studied with a focus in the fuzzy front end stage of the innovation development process. The guiding principle behind the study and the development work involved the application of the generic methodology of risk management to the challenges associated with new business creation, with the intention of raising open discussion about the aim of the risk management. The target is not only to identify and assess risks, and select risk reducing measures, but also to consider how best to quickly and effectively respond to realised opportunities and risks as they arise. A study of extant literature was supplemented by further analysis of the previous large interview study of innovation management practices (in which 43 managers were interviewed from 12 major companies and public organisations). The main research question of the work could subsequently be defined as ""How should future uncertainty be managed in new innovation and business development?"" Based on the results of the literature study, a generic model, which describes the main phases and the influencing factors of the innovation process, could also be defined. Emphasis was placed on the modelling the front end, especially the conceptualisation phase. Integration DEFinition (IDEF) methods were applied in this work. The overall goal was to support strategic decision making at critical points of the innovation process by helping companies to identify phases and elements in their innovation process where specific managerial or development actions are needed. Subsequently, the front end was no longer as ""fuzzy""; it should now be elucidated. The main effort during this study was directed at the real innovation development cases at three companies. Although different approaches were used in each of the cases; they all started from an idea associated with a new business opportunity, but the operative development of the new innovation involved was very different. The cases were named accordingly: 1. Case conceptualisation which followed the traditional approach; where concept development was succeeded by new product development. 2. Case strategic co-ordination where the technology of innovation was already available in-house, but the new business creation required a new kind of strategic offering planning for the company. 3. Case acquisition where new technology necessary for the new business was taken over by an acquisition. Tools and methods were applied and further developed within these cases, such as roadmapping, portfolio management and scorecards for specific phases in innovation management. Discussion was initiated on not only how best to consider the commercialisation phase during the early stages of the innovation process, but also on what the challenges while creating new service business actually are. The feedback led to a conclusion that a systematic approach to decision making that could be applied throughout the innovation life cycle was still needed. As a final result of this endeavour, a systematic innovation management framework focused on providing support for strategic decision making under conditions of high uncertainty about the future, was developed. The work was conducted in cooperation with the experts of the service science and technology foresight from the IBM Almaden Research (USA). This publication combines the main results of the work done at VTT within the INNORISK project. INNORISK was a 3-year joint research project between the Corporate Foresight Group (CoFi) of Åbo Akademi and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland as a part of the LIITO technology programme of Tekes. The main research finding of the work can be presented as a proposition: It is less important as to which particular tool is used in supporting the decision making related to new innovation and business development under a high level of future uncertainty. What is the most important is that this analysis is done in a systematic way that considers multiple viewpoints. The project provided a good overview of the demands of innovation process management. Since INNORISK had a broad scope, some of the developed methods need to be further enhanced and refined in order to provide practical tools for practitioners (companies and organisations). The work of INNORISK is therefore being continued at VTT. Case-specific projects are being investigated in order to gain practical results for the needs of practitioners interested in improving their capabilities for business renewal.","Fuzzy front end; Innovation; Innovation management; New business development; Opportunity recognition; Radical innovation; Risk management; Uncertainty management","Fuzzy front end; Innovation management; New business development; Opportunity recognition; Radical innovation; Uncertainty management; Decision making; Financial data processing; Free radical reactions; Industry; Investments; Product development; Research; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Signal filtering and prediction; Technology transfer; Innovation",,,,,"Cooper, R.G., Edgett, S.J., (2005) Lean, Rapid, and Profitable New Product Development, , Ancaster: Product Development Institute; Dunham, J., Risk management: The program manager's perspective (2002) The PDMA Toolbook 1 for New Product Development, pp. 377-408. , P.

By 2016, the number of workers aged 60-65 are expected to double in Australia. An ageing workforce highlights amongst social, economic and fiscal impacts, the greatest challenge to organisations in their ability to retain and use their knowledge for continued competitive advantage and sustainability. Organisations in order to compete in this warfront of being successful, need to understand what is their central knowledge factor(s) that has made them successful in the past, and will continue to be competitive and successful in the future. Organisations will have the challenge of discovering and ensuring that the knowledge of wisdom that was the spell of their success does not exit them, with the slow but sure seismic shift in labour, as the ageing workforce depart. Building a collaborative knowledge system has slowly gained credence in organisations. Organisations are realizing the crucial role of employees in their interaction, skills and engagement and the different ""knows"" that has denoted a productive workforce and organisational success. The next step for knowledge management perhaps is arguably the economic foresight challenges of the chaotic workforce demographic changes that needs to bring about managing organisational wisdom knowledge in this knowledge-era. Knowledge management needs to provide some comfort for industries and organisations that are facing the ageing workforce crisis. Wisdom can be defined as the ""power of judging rightly and following the soundest course of action, based on knowledge, experience, understanding, etc (Webster's New World College Dictionary, 1997, p1533). This insightful description needs to be captured and retained for future transfer and collaborative use. After all, it is the agency of humans who bring their individual subjectivity and passion as knowledge and wisdom and make that contribution towards organisational success. The paper cites examples of organisations from two different industries in Australia which are facing this ageing phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is create interest and discussions amongst knowledge management scholars to not stop at knowledge management and to look at the next step of organisational wisdom and associate it with knowledge management and understand what wisdom is and how it can be managed, if at all.","Ageing; Knowledge; Organisational wisdom; Wisdom; Workforce","Ageing; Knowledge; Organisational wisdom; Wisdom; Workforce; Competition; Facings; Societies and institutions; Knowledge management",,,,,"(2001), Access economics Population Ageing and the Economy.

Only an embedded, and truly integrated, set of technologies will be capable of comprehensively assessing the health state of aircraft components and projecting their failure horizons based on actual usage in operational environments. The propulsion system is a critical member of the rotorcraft health assessment and an area where diagnostics and prognostic technologies have seen some success. Nonetheless the development of an integrated set of technologies for a rotorcraft engine is a challenging and active area of research. Here we will describe our efforts to design and demonstration multiple technologies for achieving the CBM objective of reducing inspections, extending the time between overhaul, and predicting component failure with sufficient foresight to allow proactive maintenance scheduling on a rotorcraft engine. Six propulsion health management (HM) technologies: continuous power assurance, erosion, remaining useful life, bearing health, model based torque and power management have been integrated into a comprehensive propulsion HM solution. The initial design concept was to provide a single on-board executable. This code was to be hosted on an enhanced health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) driven with engine and flight operational data. Ultimately, as we further considered the HM requirements we adopted a different design architecture. The HM requirements and design trade-offs will be discussed to illustrate the advantages of our partitioned architecture that contains both on-board and off-board processing and data management components. Data flow, as well as examples of subsystem and system level condition (CI), health (HI) and prognostics indicators (PI) will be presented. In addition to the software development activities, engine test cell and bearing rig data has been collected using a set of seeded faults. The value of these indicators will be discussed using the results of the seeded fault data to show how they address critical operation and sustainment questions. Three separate regimes: on-board, flight line and depot maintenance, and mission planning will be illustrated with situational operation and support scenarios. © 2010 by the American Helicopter Society International, Inc.

The investment in people must become a number one priority. Changes in the global conditions should never impact these investments because the ""pay off"" always outweighs the cost. The industry cannot talk its way out of something it behaved its way into. So now we need to ""walk the talk"" and really test our resolve to putting people first. Talent management plays a critical role. The need to strategically identify, attract, develop, and retain our key talent is crucial and will be the competitive advantage in an age where 'cost-cutting' is the word of the day. There is a definite struggle between keeping costs down yet having the foresight to make the investments today. The dramatic cycle we have been through has shined a new light on career development. Employees now know that they need to take the lead on their own progress. No longer are careers made of a linear ""up or out"" approach. The dynamics of the workforce have changed considerably and we must adjust as an industry and catch up to accommodate our diverse workforce. Careers are now made up of lattices instead of 'vertical ladders' so employees can make lateral or downward moves at different points in their career. Careers will now encompass a multi-faceted path that includes moves into different functions, technologies, and geographies. The career rules that applied in the past decade no longer apply. Organizations must now become as authentic as they can and put their talent agenda at the forefront. The higher the investment in leadership development and feeding the talent pipeline the bigger the payoff for generations to come. Now is the time to energize this new dynamic workforce about working in such a fast evolving industry. Let's start talking their ""talk"". This is the 'Facebook', Twitter' and 'Linkedin' generation. The opportunities to engage this demographic are endless and we can only solve the challenge of the looming shortage and ""crew change"" by changing the way we ""think"". Gen Y doesn't want to come to work and become CEO the next day, but they want to learn and be mentored. Within the next 5 years over 50% of our workforce will comprise of Gen Y and the traditionalists and boomers will be well on their way to retirement. Today we're in oil and gas and traditional energy markets; tomorrow who knows? How can we leverage the best of both worlds and groom these leaders of tomorrow to face the ever challenging terrains? The answer will depend on what leadership seeds we have planted that will yield future leaders who are fluent across multiple disciplines and geographies.

Alicia M. de Justo 1500, Pta. Baja, (C1107AFD) Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina","The main objective of this work was to examine some of the most relevant articles on the blind variation and selective retention model of creativity (BVSR) presented by Simonton (1999a, 1999b, 2005, 2007a, 2007b). The BVSR model is an explanatory model of creativity grounded in a larger theoretical framework known as secondary Darwinism. Darwinian theories of creativity can be classified in two groups (Feist, 2001; Simonton, 1999a, 2005). The first group, known as primary Darwinism or primary theories of Darwinism, is directly connected with Darwin's original formulation of biological evolution (Simonton, 2005). The principal purpose of primary theories is to understand the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of species whose members are able to show creative behavior. In other words, primary theories attempt to explain how creative and aesthetic skills emerge in the human being, focusing the attention on the origin and evolution of those behaviors. On the other hand, Secondary Darwinism, ""holds that creativity operates in a fashion analogous to the Darwinian Theory of Biological Evolution"" (Simonton, 2005, p. 299). In this sense, the BVSR model of creativity applies Metaphorically the Darwinian Theory to the cognitive processes involved in creativity. Thus, the mechanisms underlying the generation of new ideas are similar to the mechanisms that explain biological evolution in Darwinian terms. One of the leading expert of this model is Simonton (1999a, 1999b, 2005, 2007a, 2007b), who has expanded and redefined some of the main issues considered by the original model raised by Campbell (1960). Both, Campbell as Simonton suggest that there is no teleology in the creative process as well as discovering new ideas. It's for this reason they call their Blind Variation and Selective Retention model (BVSR). The attribute of blind is intended to highlight the lack of foresight in the production of variations: the in-ability to generative deliberately more adaptive variations. Thus, according to Campbell's theory (1960), for the production of genuinely new knowledge is essential to generate blind variations. Simonton (1999a, 1999b, 2005, 2007a, 2007b) takes the BVSR model and suggest throughout his studies and publications some modifications that extend the original model proposed by Campbell. In this sense, this article proposes to review some contributions and evidence presented by Simonton in the last decade. Then, five of the most crucial objections are examined (individual volition, social and cultural determinism, human rationality, expertise and human emotion). In order to achieve this goal, the criticisms made by some recognized authors in the area of psychology of creativity were considered, such as: Beghetto and Plucker (2007), Gardner (1999), Martindale (1999), Mumford and Antes (2007), Russ (1999), Sternberg (1999), Weisberg and Hass (2007). Finally, taking into account the ups and downs of creative ideas when confronted with reality, it is stressed Martindale's (1999) suggestion about whether it would be desirable to take into consideration the Lamarckian perspective of evolution rather than Darwinian perspective. Maybe the fact that some ideas are selected and changed over the time, it is not the result of a blind variation process but an artificial selection process according to the purposes or objectives set previously, either by the creators, either by the social group they belong to. In this sense, Csikszentmihalyi (1996/1998) has pointed out that creativity should be understand not only as an individual's process, but as a dialectical process that take place between the individual, the domain and the field.","Creativity; Darwinism; Explanatory model blind variation; Selective retention",,,,,,"Amabile, T.M., (1983) The social psychology of creativity, , New York: Springer Verlag; Amabile, T.M., The social psychology of creativity: A componential conceptualization (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, pp. 357-376; Amabile, T.M., Within you, without you (1990) Theories of creativity, pp. 61-91. , M.A. Runco & R.S.

To meet the expected demand for food without significant increases in prices, it has been estimated that we need to produce 70-100 per cent more food, in light of the growing impacts of climate change, concerns over energy security, regional dietary shifts and the Millennium Development target of halving world poverty and hunger by 2015. The goal for the agricultural sector is no longer simply to maximize productivity, but to optimize across a far more complex landscape of production, rural development, environmental, social justice and food consumption outcomes. However, there remain significant challenges to developing national and international policies that support the wide emergence of more sustainable forms of land use and efficient agricultural production. The lack of information flow between scientists, practitioners and policy makers is known to exacerbate the difficulties, despite increased emphasis upon evidence-based policy. In this paper, we seek to improve dialogue and understanding between agricultural research and policy by identifying the 100 most important questions for global agriculture. These have been compiled using a horizon-scanning approach with leading experts and representatives of major agricultural organizations worldwide. The aim is to use sound scientific evidence to inform decision making and guide policy makers in the future direction of agricultural research priorities and policy support. If addressed, we anticipate that these questions will have a significant impact on global agricultural practices worldwide, while improving the synergy between agricultural policy, practice and research. This research forms part of the UK Government's Foresight Global Food and Farming Futures project. © 2010 Earthscan.","Farming; Food security; Global agriculture; Horizon scanning; Policy; Research questions","agricultural policy; agricultural practice; climate change; developing world; energy resource; environmental impact; farming system; food consumption; food production; food security; global perspective; government; hunger; Millenium Development Goal; population growth; poverty; research work; United Kingdom",,,,,"Allard, R.W., (1999) Principles of Plant Breeding, , (2nd edn), Wiley, New York; Anderson, J.R., (2008) Aligning Global Agricultural Research Investments with National Development Activities: The CGIAR Experience, , CGIAR Secretariat, Washington, DC; Barrett, C.B., Swallow, B.M., Fractal poverty traps (2006) World Development, pp. 1-15. , 34.1; Benton, T.G., Vickery, J.A., Wilson, J.D., Farmland biodiversity: is habitat heterogeneity the key?

This model will serve as a decision support system with an environmental thorough analysis, allowing early detection of such trends. In the first phase, methodologies such as backcasting, and strategic vision set the goal of what'll be prospected. In the second phase, resources and capabilities are defined using tools such as Environmental Scanning & Monitoring, Core Strategic Vision, and SWOT among others. The third phase defines the direction based on prior information. The first control loop is made up, serving as a fast-track feedback making it adaptable to the changing environment. A fourth phase serves to define action plans and measures to achieve the objectives; this stage feeds back to keep the system updated on the progress of measures and actions taken. This model is expected to respond to the following strategic foresight basic questions: what is being sought, where the technologies are, what direction should be taken according to the current environment and how to get there. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Action plan; Backcasting; Business opportunities; Changing environment; Control loop; Deutsche Bank; Early detection; Environmental scanning; Prior information; Second phase; Siemens; Strategic foresight; Strategic vision; Systematic planning; Technology trends; Third phase; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Economics; Industrial management; Technology",,,,,"Backcasting, , http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide/4_methodology/meth_backcasting.htm, European Commission-JCR-IPTS.

In social network analysis, it is a usually problem that information for determining whether or not a network tie should be formed is missing for some network actors, and thus network can only be partially constructed due to unavailability of information. This methodology proposed in this study is based on network actors similarities calculations by vector space model to calculate how possible network ties can be formed. Also, a threshold value of similarity for deciding whether or not a network tie should be generated is suggested in this study. Four keyword-based research networks, with journal paper or research project as network actors, constructed previously are selected as the targets of this empirical study: 1) Technology Foresight Paper Network: 181 papers and 547 keywords, 2) Regional Innovation System Paper Network: 431 papers and 1165 keywords, 3) Global Sci-Tech Policy Paper Network: 548 papers and 1705 keywords, 4) Taiwans Sci-Tech Policy Project Network: 143 research projects and 213 keywords.

Only an embedded, and truly integrated, set of technologies will be capable of comprehensively assessing the health state of aircraft components and projecting their failure horizons based on actual usage in operational environments. The propulsion system is a critical member of the rotorcraft health assessment and an area where diagnostics and prognostic technologies have seen some success. Nonetheless the development of an integrated set of technologies for a rotorcraft engine is a challenging and active area of research. Here we will describe our efforts to design and demonstration multiple technologies for achieving the CBM objective of reducing inspections, extending the time between overhaul, and predicting component failure with sufficient foresight to allow proactive maintenance scheduling on a rotorcraft engine. Six propulsion health management (HM) technologies: continuous power assurance, erosion, remaining useful life, bearing health, model based torque and power management have been integrated into a comprehensive propulsion HM solution. The initial design concept was to provide a single on-board executable. This code was to be hosted on an enhanced health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) driven with engine and flight operational data. Ultimately, as we further considered the HM requirements we adopted a different design architecture. The HM requirements and design trade-offs will be discussed to illustrate the advantages of our partitioned architecture that contains both on-board and off-board processing and data management components. Data flow, as well as examples of subsystem and system level condition (CI), health (HI) and prognostics indicators (PI) will be presented. In addition to the software development activities, engine test cell and bearing rig data has been collected using a set of seeded faults. The value of these indicators will be discussed using the results of the seeded fault data to show how they address critical operation and sustainment questions. Three separate regimes: on-board, flight line and depot maintenance, and mission planning will be illustrated with situational operation and support scenarios.

Lessons include: Scenarios using 'aspirational futures' should include expectable, challenging, and visionary alternatives; beware of and understand 'allergic reactions' to foresight given some individuals', particularly leaders', psychological preferences; foresight is most effectively done by and for top leadership but foresight for units or regions of the organization can also be successful; to get the most value, it is important to err on the side of boldness and vision in developing scenarios; foresight efforts create a 'safe space' for exploring challenging situations; associations as collections of companies or professionals have unique foresight needs including elected leadership that rotates every year, and the need to communicate the results of foresight efforts to their members effectively; government and corporations have more similarities than differences in foresight, but companies have more resources and can move quickly to develop and use the foresight. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","'Allergic reactions' to foresight; 'Aspirational futures'; Foresight lessons; Government and corporate foresight","'Aspirational futures'; Allergic reactions; Foresight lessons; Government and corporate foresight; Non profit organizations; Strategic foresight; Association reactions; Profitability; Industry; corporate strategy; future prospect; government; prediction; strategic approach",,,,,"(1978) Anticipatory Democracy: People in the Politics of the Future, , Random House, New York, C.

Large-scale exercises drew in numerous stakeholders as sources of knowledge and influence, and the prominence of these exercises led to ""foresight"" being used much more widely to describe futures activities of many kinds.

Orchestrated with techniques such as the Delphi, future studies were supported by mathematical principles of probability. Several countries have surpassed this stage while moving into strategic foresight. Strategic foresight analyzes the future as a multiple reality. In other words, it means thinking differently and not reading reality in a linear manner. It means accepting that there is not one future but several futures and that one question could have more than one answer.This change has demanded a shift in mentality. The presence of the disciplines in universities is of vital importance. For example, the Technological Institute of Monterrey (Mexico) and the Universidad Externado de Colombia (Bogota) offer foresight and strategy programs at the graduate level.This article describes how different individuals, groups, agencies and institutions in Latin America have emerged thanks to the support provided by the science and technology governmental agencies of each country. The author provides examples from different countries including Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Currently, strategic foresight is slowly gaining recognition and acceptance as a compass for productive sectors and as a generator of competitiveness. However, despite the contributions of strategic foresight, Latin American countries, with the exception of some of the above-mentioned countries, have struggled to take off into the future. The role of strategic foresight can become the driving force behind this awakening, if the challenge of linking global trends with local contextualization through scenarios is accepted. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight analysis; Latin America; Scenarios; Strategic foresight","Colombia; Contextualization; Driving forces; Foresight analysis; Global trends; Governmental agency; Latin America; Latin americans; Mathematical principle; Me-xico; Scenarios; Science and Technology; Strategic foresight; Competition; Mathematical techniques; competitiveness; probability; strategic approach; Latin America",,,,,"Berger, G., L homme et ses problèmes dans le monde de demain (2007) Essai d'anthropologie prospective in De la prospective, textes fondamentaux de la prospective française 1955-1966 (Textes réunis et présentés par Philippe Durance), pp. 35-36. , L'Harmattan, Paris; Mojica, F.J., Trujillo, R., Educación Superior y Transformación Productiva, Social y Equidad en los países del Convenio Andrés Bello"" Colciencias-Convenio Andrés Bello (2007) Serie documentos Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación no 0040, primera edición, Bogotá, mayo 7, p. 70; Cámara de Comercio de Bogotá, ""Bogotá Emprende"", , http://www.bogotaemprende.com/portal/default.aspx?catID=1; http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Pol%C3%ADticasdeEstado/Visi%C3%B3nColombia2019/Qu%C3%A9eslaVisi%C3%B3nColombiaIICentenario2019/tabid/195/Default.aspx, Colombia, Departamento Nacional de Planeación. ¿Qué es la visión 2019?; http://foros.fox.presidencia.gob.mx/read.php?3, México, Presidencia de la República. , 55873; http://www.wfsmexico.org/, La Segunda República; D.

It analyses how the rationale for its use evolved over time, first providing a 'catchy' title for a study ('Project Foresight'), and then a convenient shorthand for the focus of that study, before eventually coming to formally signify a new approach to looking systematically into the future of science and technology, an inclusive and wide-ranging process that differed appreciably from that of traditional 'technology forecasting'. The paper reflects on the importance of concepts and terminology in the field of science policy research, providing examples of how an inappropriate term or phrase can damn the prospects of the research having an impact on policy, while a more politically astute use of terminology can greatly enhance the probability of making a significant impact. The paper also examines other early uses of the concept of 'foresight' in the United States and Canada at about the same time. In addition, it highlights the conceptual similarities between foresight and la prospective, a novel approach developed in France not just for looking into the future but also for shaping or even 'constructing' the future of our choice, an ambitious aspiration that it shares with foresight. This case-study on the origins and early evolution of 'technology foresight' illustrates the essential importance of terminology in differentiating key concepts in social sciences (where it sometimes gives rise to unfortunate priority disputes), and particularly in the case of policy research. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; La prospective; Policy research; Priority; Science; Technology foresight; Terminology","Foresight; La prospective; Policy research; Priority; Science; Technology foresight; Research; Technological forecasting; Terminology; Technology; conceptual framework; forecasting method; research; science and technology; technological development; terminology; Canada; United States",,,,,"Miles, I., The Development of Technology Foresight: A Review (2010) Technol.

Despite cultural differences, the two concepts are very similar. Nevertheless, the author argues that prospective is closer to strategic foresight. The prospective attitude does not wait for change and then react; it aims to master expected change (preactivity) and to induce a desired change (proactivity). Preactivity is what guides all approaches to future studies, forecasting, scenario planning and foresight. Proactivity is more voluntarist, and aims to bring about the desired changes by means of strategic planning. This leads to a hopeful message: We just have to rethink the problems to move forward. The author highlights the enduring relevance of several key thinkers ranging from Saint Augustine and Seneca to Gaston Berger and Igor Ansoff. He emphasizes the importance of a collectivity's thinking together about the future and taking action. Overall the article pleads for rigor yet some common sense explains the utility of participatory foresight with simple tools (morphological analysis, prospective workshops). In conclusion, this article emphasizes two symmetrical errors: ignore the existence of a hammer when in front of a nail or consider every problem a nail because you have a hammer!. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Forecasting; Foresight; History; La prospective; Projects; Scenarios","Common sense; Cultural difference; Foresight; Future memory; La prospective; Morphological analysis; Proactivity; Projects; Scenario Planning; Scenarios; Strategic foresight; Hammers; Forecasting; collective action; forecasting method; future prospect; history; memory; social change; strategic approach",,,,,"Blondel, M., (1993) L'Action.

So far scholars in the literature on foresight and future studies focused on the techniques and practices for analysing the ""state"" uncertainty about the likely path of evolution of emerging drivers of change. Anyway, less attention was devoted to the ""effect"" uncertainty about the impact of drivers of change on the competitive position of the firm and to the ""response"" uncertainty about how to take advantage of these drivers. These are the main issues we take into account, through a field research on firms that, notwithstanding they were able to properly assess the likely evolution (state uncertainty) of relevant drivers of change in their industry, either were successful or dramatically failed in handling the effect and response uncertainty of these drivers. Moreover, we carried out multiple case studies of some large companies that have established an organizational unit dedicated to strategic foresight. Overall, the results of our research may contribute to improve the effectiveness of strategic foresight and to increase its value added to the planning process of corporate firms, while providing helpful insight to public organizations that promote foresight exercises for enhancing the competitiveness of local firms. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Business micro and macro-environment; Emerging technologies; Foresight; Market and non-market drivers of change; Strategy formulation; Uncertainty","Emerging technologies; Foresight; Market drivers; Micro and macro; Strategy formulations; Uncertainty; Commerce; Competition; Ecology; Industry; Research; Technology; Uncertainty analysis; competitiveness; corporate strategy; forecasting method; future prospect; industrial technology; research and development; social change; strategic approach; technological development; uncertainty role",,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., (1979) Strategic Management, , Macmillan, London; Miles, R.E., Snow, C.C., (1978) Organizational Strategy, Structure, and Process, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Mintzberg, H., (1994) The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning: Reconceiving Roles for Planning, Plans, Planners, , Free Press, New York; Dill, W.R., Environment as an influence on managerial autonomy (1958) Admin.

Although foresight requires a rigorous approach to address complex problems, the tools must also be simple enough to be easily used. Since the mid-1980s, the approach in strategic prospective workshops (a term that reminds us of the participatory nature of the French approach) has proven its effectiveness in meeting these criteria (simple, rigorous and appropriable; i.e., may be appropriated by participants). The authors try to reply to simple and important questions: What is a scenario? How to judge the quality of a scenario? Which strategies for which scenarios? These questions remind us that applications of strategic foresight tools are contingent and modular. They could also involve the stakeholders from upstream to downstream, as seen in the agro-food sector. Finally, they argue that the future still has to be built and that futurists produced too many scenarios and not enough projects. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Prospective; Scenarios; Strategy; Workshops","Foresight; Prospective; Scenarios; Strategy; Workshops; complexity; forecasting method; future prospect; social change; strategic approach; technological development",,,,,"(1975) Travaux et Recherches de Prospective Paris, , La méthode des scénarios, La Documentation française, Datar; Kahn, H., Wiener, A.J., (1967) The Year 2000: A Framework for Speculation on the Next Thirty-Three Years, , Macmillan, New York; (1968) L'an 2000, , R.

See L. R. Brown, Building a Sustainable Society, Norton, New York, (1981) and G. MIinati, M.P. Penna, E. Pessa, A conceptual framework for self-organization and merging processes in social systems, in Systems For Sustainability, Plenum Press, New York, (1997). Nowadays, all initiatives must be sustainable and are primarily assessed on that criterion. However, the efforts made to construct specific methods dedicated to building sustainable strategies seem rather weak. Futurists themselves underestimate the relationship between sustainable development and foresight, even if they are talking about sustainable planning. Sustainable planning integrates the objectives of economic development, social justice and inclusion, environment integrity and integrated transport. There is often conflict between short-term economic and fiscal benefits and the longer-term environmental and social implications arising from development. Cf. Ian Miles, Michaël Keenan Practical Guide to Regional Foresight in the United Kingdom, European Commission, DG Research, Brussels (2000) 18. They remain generally unaware that foresight could be a major tool in tackling sustainability as well as one of the best methods of preparing sustainable strategies and policies.Indeed, one of the biggest problems in sustainability approaches is the simplistic way used to define the concept, for instance, by using only the very first part of the 1987 the Bruntland report Our Common Future and by limiting the fields of activity on sustainability to the three pillars of the OECD model: economy, social questions, environment.At the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference (December 2009), it seemed forgotten that sustainability is already an old issue in which futurists were heavily involved at the time of the United Nations Stockholm Environment Conference (1972), in the Limits to Growth Report, published by the Club of Rome (1972). D.L. Meadows, ed., Limits to growth, Earth Island Ltd, London (1972). and in the OECD Interfutures Foresight, spurred on by Jacques Lesourne (1978). INTERFUTURS, Research project on the future development of advanced industrialised societies in harmony with that of developing countries, Final reports, Paris, OECD, 28 September 1978.Since that time (forty years ago!) researchers and consultants have learned how to deal with the concept of sustainability, how to analyze it as an ultimate aim for society as a whole as well as a complex object that needs to be approached with adequate methods such as systemic analysis.As Christian Stoffaës said, the aim of foresight is sustainable development in a changing world. As a result, the ultimate aim of strategic foresight appears to be clear: it is sustainability. This article highlights that fundamental relationship as we see it today. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Ecology; Strategic foresight; Sustainable development; Sustainable planning","Brussels; Christians; Complex objects; Conceptual frameworks; Copenhagen; Economic development; European Commission; Integrated transport; Merging process; New York; Practical guide; Self-organizations; Social implication; Social justice; Social systems; Stockholm; Strategic foresight; Sustainable planning; Sustainable society; Sustainable strategies; United kingdom; United Nations; Climate change; Climate models; Developing countries; Ecology; Economics; Planning; Research; Sustainable development; conceptual framework; economic development; economic planning; future prospect; self organization; social inclusion; social justice; sustainable development",,,,,"Massé, P., (1973) La crise du développement, pp. 132-133. , Gallimard, Paris; Stoffaës, C., Les logiciels de la pérennité, dans Jacques Lesourne et Christian Stoffaës (2001) Prospective stratégique d'entreprise, pp. 25-27. , Dunod, Paris; (1972) Limits to Growth, , Earth Island Ltd, London, D.L.

The same applies to other concepts stemming from various cultures.

The planning, the route and the destination of the journey shape scenarios in which architecture is present, defining the character, the form and the surroundings of the future. The representation of those surroundings, and the foresight contained in science fiction, produces innumerable different examples that imagine the diversity of possible scenarios in futures far and near. The mixture of inhabitable elements along the journey, where city, buildings and transport are sometimes indistinguishable, is added to the film director's superimposed reflection of reality and personal vision of the future. The train arriving at the city, a symbol of the first film screening, and the vision of stars seen by the space shuttle passenger, are metaphors for the fascination of humankind for their own discovery, and of the constant desire to advance towards the fulfilment of their imagination.","Architecture; City; Foresight; Representation; Science fiction; Travel",,,,,,"Barber, S., (2006) Ciudades Proyectadas.

Foresight approach was the methodology used, developed through the specialists projection based on their knowledge, by applying a Delphi questionnaire, and contemplating the segments of the forest production, industry and generation of energy. The main conclusions were: a) readiness of forest residues exists to use for the production of energy, it has been necessary to adapt the process in forest crop; b) investments and qualification in human resources and new industrial technology processes are required for taking better advantage of forest resources; and c) the production of energy by using the biomass in the original forest might grow.","Energy; Search and demands",,,,,,"Astigarraga, E., (2006) El Método Delphi, , www.codesyntax.com/prospectiva/Metodo_delphi.pdf, Donosita, San Sebastián:Universidad de Deusto, Acesso em, Acesso em: 10 ago. 2006; Bacchi, M.R.P., Brasil - Gerando Energia De Biomassa, Limpa E Renovável, , http:www.cepea.esalq.usp.br, CEPEA.

R&D portfolio selection is of critical importance to high-tech operations such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, because it determines the blend of technological development the firm must invest in its R&D resources. This R&D investment leads to differentiating technologies that drive the firm's market position. We developed a general, three-phase decision-support structure for the R&D portfolio selection problem. First is the scenario generation phase, where we transform qualitative assessment and market foresight from senior executives and market analysts into quantitative data. This is combined with the company's financial data (e.g., revenue projections) to generate scenarios of potential project revenue outcomes. This is followed by the optimization phase, where a multistage stochastic program (SP) is solved to maximize expected operating income (OI) subject to risk, product interdependency, capacity, and resource allocation constraints. The optimization procedure generates an efficient frontier of portfolios at different OI (return) and risk levels. The refinement phase offers managerial insights through a variety of analysis tools that utilize the optimization results. For example, the robustness of the optimal portfolio with respect to the risk level, the variability of a portfolio's OI, and the resource level usage as a function of the optimal portfolio can be analyzed and compared to any qualitatively suggested portfolio of projects. The decision-support structure is implemented, tested, and validated with various real-world cases and managerial recommendations. We discuss our implementation experience using a case example, and we explain how the system is incorporated into the corporate R&D investment decisions. © 2010 INFORMS.",,"Analysis tools; Efficient frontier; Financial data; Investment decisions; Market analysts; Market position; Operating Income; Optimal portfolios; Optimization procedures; Portfolio selection; Portfolio selection problems; Project portfolio; Qualitative assessments; Quantitative data; Real-world; Refinement phase; Research and development; Resource allocation constraints; Resource levels; Risk levels; Scenario generation; Semiconductor industry; Semiconductor manufacturers; Support structures; Technological development; Commerce; Decision support systems; Ground supports; Industry; Investments; Metadata; Optimization; Semiconductor device manufacture; Economics",,,,,"Anderson, E.G., Joglekar., N.R., A hierarchical product development planning framework (2005) Production Oper.

Always ahead of the technological curve, this library has been the front-runner in providing services to distance learners via text messaging, ""chat,"" e-mail, and telephone services and via its laptop librarian project across the campus. It now is poised and ready to provide service in Second Life. Collaboration between the library and teaching faculty culminated in the creation, development, and furnishing of a library in Second Life, an environment that gives new meaning to ""off-campus"" learning. Without marketing, but as a visible presence, the Second Life library was able to attract both off-campus guests and affiliated students and faculty and even participated in campus-wide projects. This experiment has enjoyed the support of both the university and library administration. © L. Ralph & B.

The credit crunch has led to occupiers rethinking their strategic requirements, and, at the same time, they are fire fighting to keep their occupation costs at a level that will allow the companies to survive. This briefing note aims to look at the activity between landlords and tenants in the market to determine, indicatively, the changes that are happening due to the downturn. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an indicative survey and market commentary. Findings: In this market, more than any other, tenants are approaching landlords with the idea of renegotiating their rental liabilities. Landlords are considering each proposal on its merits and solutions are ranging from side agreements to not demand full payment, to surrender and renewals to provide a more even cash flow or outright surrenders with a reverse premium being paid. Practical implications: This paper looks at the UK market and the nature of agreements being made with a background of such uncertainty. The booming investment market of the last few years has shielded the profession from the need to consider fully the role of proactive management. This paper argues that good relationship management and a foresight to negotiate to protect future cash flows means that, now more than ever, management surveyors can enhance and protect capital values. Originality/value: This paper provides an insight into the confluence of requirements between landlords and tenants in a market driven by a lack of capital and access to borrowings on both sides. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic change; Investments; Leasing; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Paribas, B.N.P., (2009) BNP real estate outlook 2009, , www.realestate.bnpparibas.co.uk/, Autumn, available at:, (accessed 14 November 2009); (2008) Credit crunch and the property market, , www.london.gov.uk/mayor/economic_unit/docs/credit-crunch.pdf, CBRE, available at:, (accessed 17 November 2009); (2007), www.leasingbusinesspremises.co.uk, Code for Leasing Business Premises, available at: (accessed 14 November 2009); (2009) CoStar UK investment bulletin - Q3 2009, , www.propertyweek.com/Journals/Builder_Group/Property_Week/06_November_2009/attachments/Investment_Bulletin_Q3_2009.pdf, CoStar, available at:, (accessed 15 November 2009); Currie, M., (2009) Commercial property poised for a comeback?, , www.investorschronicle.co.uk/InvestmentGuides/Funds/article//Commercial-property-poised-for-a-comeback.jsp, available at: (accessed 17 November 2009); (2009) King Sturge property predictions 09, , http://resources.kingsturge.com/contentresources/library/1/research/2009/01Jan/090120095098_pdf.pdf, King Sturge, available at:, (accessed 17 November 2009); (2009) Central London Offices - quarterly report, , http://resources.knightfrank.com/GetResearchResource.ashx?id=1166, Knight Frank, available at:, (accessed 17 November 2009); (2009) Winter 2008/2009 European investment commentary, , http://resources.knightfrank.com/GetResearchResource.ashx?id=11423, Knight Frank, available at:, (accessed 18 November 2009); (2009) UK healthcare development opportunities, , http://resources.knightfrank.com/GetResearchResource.ashx?id=11644, Knight Frank, available at:, (accessed 18 November 2009); O'Connell, B., London rents to rise as completions hit new low (2009) Estates Gazette, , 14 November; (2009) Interest rate graph, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7818717.stm#chart, Bank of England, available at:, (accessed 8 November 2009); Baum, A., (2009) Commercial Real Estate Investment: A Strategic Approach, , EG Books, Oxford; Bootle, R., Wild, D., Don't over-buy all this recovery talk (2009) Estates Gazette, p. 19. , 14 November; Burton, K., Commercial property market trends (2005) The Daily Reckoning, , www.dailyreckoning.co.uk/property-investment/commercial-property-market-trends.html, available at:, (accessed 17 November 2009); (2009) The UK property investment market, , www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/docviewer/UK%20BB%20Inv%20Market%20November%2009.pdf, Cushman and Wakefield, available at:, (accessed 16 November 2009); (2008) Commercial property overview, , www.invistarealestate.com/pdfs/documents/commercial-property-overview.pdf, Invista Real Estate Investment Management, available at:, (accessed 17 November 2009); (2009) Capturing outperformance and opportunities in Central London office market, , www.joneslanglasalle.co.uk/unitedkingdom/en-gb/pages/NewsDetail.aspx?ItemID=18131, Jones Lang LaSalle, available at:, (accessed 14 November 2009); http://resources.knightfrank.com/GetResearchResource.ashx?id=1164409, Knight Frank, available at:, n.d; Loo, D., (2008) Commercial property sees double-digit dip in 2009, , www.reuters.com/article/companyNews/id, available at:, (accessed 16 November 2009); Pentelow, L., (2009) Inward investment into UK commercial property, , www.mazars.co.uk/Home/News/Latest-news/Tax/Inward-Investment-into-UK-commercial-property, available at:, accessed 15 November 2009); Phillips, M., Dixon, A., British land widens view with strategic shake-up (2009) Estates Gazette, p. 37. , 17 October; (2009) Distressed sales increase worldwide, , www.rics.org/site/scripts/press_article.aspx?pressReleaseID=115, RICS, available at:, (accessed 16 November 2009); Ruddick, G., London and Stamford worried about rapid property gains (2009) The Daily Telegraph, , 20 November","French, N.; School of the Built Environment, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, United Kingdom; email: nick.french@brookes.ac.uk",,,,,,,,1463578X,,,,"English","J.

A case study of a technology foresight project conducted in Japan in 2007-2008 is studied. This is a project that tried a new form of mission-oriented technology foresight by coupling two or more technology foresight methodologies. Then, three dilemmas related to the possibility of integrating the Delphi method and scenario writing are considered, along with the assumed action plans for the new technology foresight. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Delphi; Integration; Multi-methodology; Scenario; Technology foresight","Action plan; Delphi; Delphi method; Multi-methodology; New forms; New technologies; Scenario; Technology foresight; Decision making; Integration; Technology",,,,,"Aichholzer, G., The Austrian foresight program: Organization and expert profile (2001) Int.

Managers and entrepreneurs who have made successful predictions and have invested money on this basis are promoted, become rich, and may end up on the cover of business magazines.

'Futures research' has a systems science orientation with a planning horizon in excess of 10 years. 'Futures studies' has a social science connotation and 'foresight' is the most popular term within the management science and corporate sectors. Five schools of futures researchers are defined: 1. Environmental and geosciences. 2. Infrastructure systems and engineering technology. 3. Social, political and economic science. 4. Human life, mind and information science. 5. Business and management science. The academic route to a futures qualification is outlined with a list of futures orientated organisations. The inclusion of urbanisation in the next generation of scenarios for climate change research and assessment, would involve replacing the notion of economic equilibrium by the concept of far-from-equilibrium stability.

While optimism was justified by Technology and Culture's subscribers and contributors, his hope that ""the larger historical community"" would embrace the journal was slow to materialize. Complaints about T&C's persistent ""progress talk"" and ""narrow"" inquiries had some substance. But this essay suggests that fifty years have given us much to celebrate. T&C garners praise for ""the diversity, the tension, and the energetic spirit of inquiry of this emerging hybrid discipline."" Such praise owes largely to Kranzberg's dedication and spirit. He showed strategic foresight in signaling an ""interlacing"" of disciplines in the journal's name, and enlisted allies from across the academic spectrum and beyond. This essay narrates his alliance with Peter Drucker, among ""the most influential intellectuals of the twentieth century."" Drucker worked with Kranzberg into the 1970s, helping secure the institution and integrate analyses of how devices and processes work with questions about technology as part of a ""complex whole.""

He saw this simply as giving readers ""more for their money,"" but Wayne State saw it as ""excess"" worth thousands of dollars, and the end came when SHOT no longer had the means to pay up.

""Of course not,"" I said; Journal of Interdisciplinary History, , The value of an interdisciplinary perspective was affirmed by the success of other journals founded in the 1950s and 1960s, such as Past and Present (which may have been a model for T&C: ""articles on historical, social, and cultural change [for] specialists and non-specialists"") and the; note; Kranzberg to Lynn White jr., 14 February 1958, KP217; also Kranzberg to Keith and Ruth Glennan, 10 May 1984, and Cyril Stanley Smith to Keith Glennan, 17 January 1964, KP109; Of course, Kranzberg had known of Mumford since he was a freshman at Amherst and was assigned Technics and Civilization, but Condit became his friend in 1952 when Mumford wrote an enthusiastic review of The Rise of the Skyscraper for The New Yorker; The Politics of American Science, , Among the treasures of the Kranzberg Papers are his overtures to politicians who had an interest in technology for one reason or another. Senator Flanders and Herbert Hoover both agreed to serve on the advisory council. Kranzberg asked Vice President Hubert Humphrey to review, by four protégés of Hunter Dupree's including Pursell, and he sent a copy of the first issue of T& C to Pat Nixon, asking that she pass it on to her husband, vice president at the time.

(See, [New York]; The Wilkie Foundation, founded by Leighton and his brothers Robert and James, also subsidized Woodbury's scholarship on machine tools as part of the monograph series that SHOT published in concert with MIT Press.

Kelly was slated to follow, but, after spearheading a membership campaign among industrial research labs ($100 institutional memberships), he declined the office and then dropped out of the society. Perhaps he was uncomfortable about Burlingame, and he was definitely unhappy that nobody was writing about ""the dramatic invention of the transistor"" (Kelly to Lynn White jr., 15 January 1962, KP134).

The approach is applied to the study of land use strategies on commercial ranches in Namibia. First, we compare two models differing in their structure: the first one is an inter-temporal optimization model (forward-looking with perfect foresight) while the second is recursive and it explicitly incorporates uncertainty in the decision making process. Second, we point out the structural advantage of the recursive optimization model in its ability to simulate how decision makers' perceptions on the occurrence of stochastic events alter land use strategies and their economic and ecological outcomes. Both models make use of a State-and-Transition conceptual framework to depict the bio-economic feedback. We found that the incorporation of rainfall uncertainty in decision making is crucial when modeling land use strategies in highly variable ecological-economic systems such as ranches in arid rain-fed areas. Where knowledge of rainfall distribution is inaccurate (due to lack of experience or climate change) both, farmers and rangelands, would be better off by precautiously expecting low rainfalls. Finally, our results show that minimizing herd size adjustment costs would support the establishment of sustainable land use strategies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-economic model; Rainfall expectations; Rangelands; Recursive modeling; State-and-Transition; Stochastic modeling","conceptual framework; decision making; environmental economics; environmental values; land use; optimization; rainfall; ranching; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; Namibia",,,,,"Abreha, N.H., (2007), p. 134. , An Economic Analysis of Farmers' Risk Attitudes and Farm households' Responses to rainfall Risk in Tigray Nothern Ethiopia.

As ""Part II"" of a previous publication, it seeks to focus on the lower (plural) quadrants. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adapts Ken Wilber's integral theory to clarify various philosophical orientations to the future. It also adapts Fredrich Polak's approach to futures as a matter of ""social critique and reconstruction""; however, the approach is global, civilizational, and integral, so it proposes civilizational critique and integral reconstruction as a method for evaluating futures schools of thought. Findings: The IF framework is found to be a valuable theoretical and analytical tool for clarifying images of the future; it shows lines of development within each quadrant and interactions between quadrants, illustrating the effectiveness of the four-quadrant approach. Research limitations/implications: It further illuminates the ""global problematique"" expressed in the SOPIFF project and proposes the IF framework as a way to interpret those research findings. Practical implications: This approach to futures/foresight studies broadens the range and offers more depth to conceptions of the future, so it should help to develop/improve futures methodologies/practices in general. Social implications: Civilizational critique and integral reconstruction of images of the future imply unprecedented social change. Originality/value: The paper should help futurists to see and interpret the ""bigger picture"" of civilizational futures through revealing the ""crack"" of the modern image of the future, how it relates to the current world crisis, and what is needed to heal the crack, so a new vision of a preferred future can emerge. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Philosophical concepts; Social change; Society",,,,,,"Bacevich, A.J., (2002) American Empire, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Barnett, T.P.M., (2004) The Pentagon's New Map: War and Peace in the 21st Century, , http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/pnm/bibliography/chapter1.htm, available at:, Putnam, New York, NY; Berman, M., (2006) Dark Ages America: The Final Phase of Empire, , W.W.

It was recently suggested that differential activity for memory and future thinking may be linked to differences in the phenomenal properties (e.g., richness of detail). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy subjects and a novel experimental design, we investigated the networks involved in the imagery of future and the recall of past events for the same target occasion, i.e. the Christmas and New Year's holidays, thereby keeping temporal distance and content similar across conditions. Although ratings of phenomenal characteristics were comparable for future thoughts and memories, differential activation patterns emerged. The right posterior hippocampus exhibited stronger memory-related activity during early event recall, and stronger future thought-related activity during late event imagination. Other regions, e.g., the precuneus and lateral prefrontal cortex, showed the reverse activation pattern with early future-associated and late past-associated activation. Memories compared to future thoughts were further related to stronger activation in several visual processing regions, which accords with a reactivation of the original perceptual experience. In conclusion, the results showed for the first time unique neural signatures for both memory and future thinking even in the absence of differences in phenomenal properties and suggested different time courses of brain activation for episodic memory and future thinking. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","FMRI; Foresight; Hippocampus; Imagination; Mental time travel; Neuroimaging; Remembering","adult; article; behavior; brain function; episodic memory; female; functional assessment; functional magnetic resonance imaging; futurology; human; human experiment; image analysis; image processing; imagination; male; neuroimaging; normal human; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; thinking; brain; brain mapping; hippocampus; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; recall; thinking; time; young adult; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Imagination; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Recall; Neuropsychological Tests; Thinking; Time Factors; Young Adult; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Imagination; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Recall; Neuropsychological Tests; Thinking; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,,,"Suddendorf, T., Corballis, M.C., Mental time travel and the evolution of the human mind (1997) Genet Soc Gen Psychol Monogr, 123, pp. 133-167; Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., Episodic future thinking (2001) Trends Cogn Sci, 5, pp. 533-539; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Remembering the past and imagining the future: common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 1363-1377; Botzung, A., Denkova, E., Manning, L., Experiencing past and future personal events: functional neuroimaging evidence on the neural bases of mental time travel (2008) Brain Cogn, 66, pp. 202-212; Okuda, J., Fujii, T., Ohtake, H., Tsukiura, T., Tanji, K., Suzuki, K., Thinking of the future and past: the roles of the frontal pole and the medial temporal lobes (2003) Neuroimage, 19, pp. 1369-1380; Szpunar, K.K., Watson, J.M., McDermott, K.B., Neural substrates of envisioning the future (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 642-647; Suddendorf, T., Episodic memory versus episodic foresight: similarities and differences (2010) Cogn Sci, 1, pp. 99-107; Weiler, J.A., Suchan, B., Daum, I., Foreseeing the future: occurrence probability of imagined future events modulates hippocampal activation (2009) Hippocampus; Addis, D.R., Moscovitch, M., Crawley, A.P., McAndrews, M.P., Recollective qualities modulate hippocampal activation during autobiographical memory retrieval (2004) Hippocampus, 14, pp. 752-762; Addis, D.R., Schacter, D.L., Constructive episodic simulation: temporal distance and detail of past and future events modulate hippocampal engagement (2008) Hippocampus, 18, pp. 227-237; D'Argembeau, A., Xue, G., Lu, Z.L., Van der Linden, M., Bechara, A., Neural correlates of envisioning emotional events in the near and far future (2008) Neuroimage, 40, pp. 398-407; Addis, D.R., Pan, L., Vu, M.A., Laiser, N., Schacter, D.L., Constructive episodic simulation of the future and the past: distinct subsystems of a core brain network mediate imagining and remembering (2009) Neuropsychologia, 47, pp. 2222-2238; Addis, D.R., Wong, A.T., Schacter, D.L., Age-related changes in the episodic simulation of future events (2008) Psychol Sci, 19, pp. 33-41; D'Argembeau, A., Van der Linden, M., Phenomenal characteristics associated with projecting oneself back into the past and forward into the future: influence of valence and temporal distance (2004) Conscious Cogn, 13, pp. 844-858; Suddendorf, T., Corballis, M.C., The evolution of foresight: what is mental time travel, and is it unique to humans?

A foresight exercise aimed at renewal of the mature food industry in the Skåne region in southern Sweden was conducted in 2006-2007. The findings suggest that a multilevel triple helix policy ought to be used in a systemic way from a bottom up perspective, including companies as well as other triple helix actors throughout the value chain. Further, the findings underscore the importance of the role intermediaries play enhancing the integrative abilities of actors in the regional food system. Cultural analysis is used to elicit a deeper understanding of the different regimes that influence the actors. This is consistent with the observation highlighted in this article that the actors in the food system bear values arising from a time when the Swedish food system catered for national self-sufficiency under a regime of limited market competition. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural analysis; Foodscape; Foresight; Innovation system; Mature industry; Systemic","bottom-up approach; competition (economics); food industry; innovation; regional development; research and development; technology policy; Skane; Sweden",,,,,"Adema, P., (2009) Garlic Capital of The World: Gilroy, Garlic, and The Making of A Festive Foodscape, , Jackson: University Press of Mississippi; Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global cultural economy (1990) Public Culture, 2, pp. 19901-19924; Bergek, A., Jacobsson, S., Hekkert, M., Smith, K., Functionality of innovation systems as a rationale for, and guide to innovation policy (2007) Innovation Policy, Theory and Practice: An International Handbook, , ed.

In an empirical analysis, it seeks to show how the technique of creative competition was used in a scenario-project. The case study shows how and why the technique of creative competition ""worked"". These findings will then be used to explore the broader application of creative competition in organisational foresight. Design/methodology/approach: The study first elaborates theoretically on the difference between ""forecast"" and ""foresight"" and explores how the addition of the organisational dimension to these terms changes their meanings. It then focuses on the organisation that commissioned the study - Rijkswaterstaat - and describes its history with respect to exploring the future and certain other relevant contextual elements of the case study, such as how the project was organised. After that, it conceptualises the RWS2020 project as an example of using ""organisational foresight"" and discusses the concept of ""creative competition"" as a means of bringing ""organisation"" and ""foresight"" closer together. The paper then describes what creative competition was used in the case, how it worked in the case study, and how ""the game"" of creative competition was played. It formulates conclusions on the basis of this case study and then reflects on the findings. Findings: Application of creative competition adds to the integration of foresight in organizational management and organizational change. It supports a more future orientedness in strategic management. Further analysis of other cases is needed to further strengthen theory about application of the method of creative competition. Originality/value: The technique of creative competition is relatively new and has not been theorized as yet. Organizational foresight has been used as a concept, but has hardly been theorized and empirically tested as well. The paper does both, in an exploratory way. It provides interesting insight into the working of organizational foresight for both academics and practitioners, and identifies strategic choices for managers conducting organizational foresight studies with or without the use of creative competition. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive strategy; Creative thinking; Organizational change; Organizational planning; Strategic management",,,,,,"(2001) Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practitioners, , Armstrong, J.S.

Despite the emergence of diverse foresight lineages, methods and tools, the differences between 'better proactive foresight' and 'better reactive preparedness' remain unclear. This paper focuses on the 2007-2010 financial crisis in order to clarify misconceptions and confusions concerning 'scenario planning'. We assess why the crisis is not unique and propose how scenarios might be helpful in overcoming the difficulties of learning from crisis. We focus on how scenarios were used in the run up to this crisis to clarify the nature, role and effectiveness of scenario work. We highlight implications for scholarship and practice, including: overcoming simplistic distinctions of scenarios as products or processes; and as outputs or inputs. We assess the power of scenarios as frames and their role in re-framing strategic conversation; and contrast the misapplication of probability in systemic risk analysis with the co-production of plausibility, between builders and users of scenarios.

In this short essay, the author focuses on a number of specific topics which reveal both Röling's foresight and his specific understanding of the individual suspect's predicament when charged with international crimes. It is in this light that key issues such as Röling's ideas about individual responsibility and the crime of aggression, or the superior responsibility of civilians standing in the dock at Tokyo, are addressed, along with an assessment of Röling's position on related concepts such as duress and mistake of law. The essay concludes with some reflections on Röling's general ideas and views on the functions and aims of international criminal law. Above all, the essay highlights Röling's intellect and realism when dealing with international criminal law, and foregrounds this kind and humane man's life-long search for even-handed justice. © Oxford University Press, 2010, All rights reserved.",,,,,,,"Teunissen, P.J., A Humanist for Peace (1977) Declarations on Principles; A Quest for Universal Peace, pp. XVII-XVII10. , For a vivid portrait, R.J.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper utilizes the equations of flow equilibrium to determine the variations of film thickness or displacement of loading table with respect to the varying of recess pressure. For a hydrostatic bearing whose recess pressures are controlled by compensations, the stiffness characteristics can be presented directly by these variations. Findings - The usage range of recess pressure and compensation parameters should be selected to correspond to a variation with smallest gradient. Originality/value - This paper proposes an extensive database as a critical requirement for the selection of types and parameters of the compensation as to yield the acceptable or optimized characteristics in design of hydrostatic bearings. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Although oil is a vital commodity, potential supply disruptions are less worrisome than scholars, politicians, and pundits presume. This article identifies four adaptive mechanisms that together can compensate for almost all oil shocks, meaning that continuous supply to consumers will limit scarcity-induced price increases. The adaptive mechanisms are not particularly fragile and do not require tremendous foresight by either governments or economic actors. We illustrate these mechanisms at work using evidence from every major oil disruption since 1973. We then identify the small subset of disruptive events that would overwhelm these adaptive mechanisms and therefore seriously harm the United States. Finally, we analyze the utility of U.S. foreign military policy tools in addressing these threats. Our findings suggest that the United States can defend its key interests in the Persian Gulf-the world's most important oil-producing region-with a less-intrusive, ""over the horizon"" posture. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"http://www.eia.doe.gov, Note; (2006) National Security Consequences of U.S. Oil Dependency, pp. 48-49+53+56-59. , Council on Foreign Relations, Independent Task Force Report no. 58, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, October; Crane, K., Goldthau, A., Toman, M., Johnson, S.E., Nader, A., Rabasa, A., Dogo, H., (2009) Imported Oil and U.S. National Security, , Santa Monica:, RAND Corporation; (1998) A National Security Strategy for a New Century, pp. 6+12-13+32-33+52+54. , Note; Barnes, J., Jaffe, A., Morse Edward, L., (2004) The New Geopolitics of Oil,"" the National Interest, , Note; Rutledge, I., (2005) Addicted to Oil: America's Relentless Drive For Energy Security, pp. 7+132+197-198. , London:, I.B.

The evolution of this course over the past ten years is described in this essay which also indicates how the course became internationally recognized with participants attending from 40 different countries. The way the course has also influenced the evolution of other and similar courses globally is also discussed.","Executive training; Foresight; Organizers; Policy; Practitioners; Research planning; Sponsors",,,,,,"Cagnin, C., Scapolo, F., (2007) Technical report on a foresight training course, , Seville, Spain: IPTS.

These techniques are combined in a Foresight exercise assessing development of clean production in metal manufacturing, drawing on the European CLEANPROD project. The aim of the project is to develop a set of roadmaps for metal processing R&D to achieve breakthrough sustainability - ""clean production"".Scenarios, a frequently used Foresight method, are used to set the context for the exercise, inform the design of technology roadmaps and influence the wider policy context. Roadmaps are developed for three process areas of metal manufacture - surface preparation, machining and coating - on four levels including long run visions up to 2020, interim targets up to 2015, key R&D areas and specific project topics. Roadmaps are appraised in the light of alternative scenarios on the future of manufacturing. Promoting sustainability highlights gaps in a ""business as usual"" roadmap, suggesting a different portfolio of research projects. A revised overall scenario is used to shape public policy.R&D teams usually adopt one particular methodology to support resource allocation. However joint use of futures techniques helps if there is uncertainty over competing alternative technologies. Roadmapping often focuses on a single future. Scenario building as a Foresight technique introduces ""multiple futures"" thinking. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Clean production; Dry machining; Foresight; Manufacturing; Roadmapping; Scenarios; Sustainability","Alternative technologies; Business-as-usual; Clean production; Dry machining; Metal manufacturing; Metal processing; Road-maps; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Scenario building; Surface preparation; Technology roadmaps; Machining; Metal drawing; Research; Sustainable development; Manufacture; cleaner production; future prospect; manufacturing; methodology; research and development; resource allocation; sustainability; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Erdmann, L., Behrendt, S., http://forera.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/papers/FTA%20Seville%20Seminar%20-%20submitted%20paper.pdf, From technology-driven roadmapping towards sustainability-oriented roadmapping: development and application of an integrated method, Second International Seville Seminar on Future-Oriented Technology Analysis, Seville, 28-29 September 2006 (at, last visited November 5, 2009); Paramanathan, S., Farrukh, C., Phaal, R., Probert, D., Implementing industrial sustainability: the research issues in technology management (2004) R&D Management, 34 (5), pp. 527-537; Green, K., McMeekin, A., Irwin, A., Technological trajectories and R&D for environmental innovation in UK firms (1994) Futures, 26 (10), pp. 1047-1059; Taylor, M.R., Rubin, E.S., Hounshell, D.A., Control of SO2 emissions from power plants: a case of induced technological innovation in the U.S. (2005) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 72 (6), pp. 697-718; Tao, L., Garnsey, E., Probert, D., Ridgman, T., Innovation as response to emissions legislation: revisiting the automotive catalytic converter at Johnson Matthey (2010) R&D Management, 40 (2), pp. 154-168; McDowall, W., Eames, M., Forecasts, scenarios, visions, backcasts and roadmaps to the hydrogen economy: a review of the hydrogen futures literature (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (11), pp. 1236-1250; Kostoff, R.N., Boylan, R., Simons, G.R., Disruptive technology roadmaps (2004) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 71 (1-2), pp. 141-159; Robinson, J.B., Energy backcasting: a proposed method of policy analysis (1982) Energy Policy, 10 (4), pp. 337-344; Robinson, J.B., Unlearning and backcasting: rethinking some of the questions we ask about the future (1988) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 33 (4), pp. 325-338; Dreborg, K.H., Essence of backcasting (1996) Futures, 28 (9), pp. 813-828; Meade, N., Islam, T., Modelling and forecasting the diffusion of innovation - A 25-year review (2006) International Journal of Forecasting, 22 (3), pp. 519-545; Van der Heijden, K., Scenarios and forecasting: two perspectives (2000) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 65 (1), pp. 31-36; Porter, T.M., (1995) Trust in Numbers: the Pursuit of Objectivity in Science and Public Life, , Princeton UP, New Jersey; Amsteus, M., Managerial foresight: concept and measurement (2008) Foresight, 10 (1), pp. 53-66; Armstrong, J.S., Combining forecasts (2001) Principles of Forecasting: a Handbook for Researchers and Practitioners, pp. 417-440. , Kluwer, Boston, J.S.

We provide clinical examples in which a patient may prefer to wait and take the chance that an improved therapy comes to market rather than choose an irreversible treatment option that has serious quality of life ramifications and would render future treatment discoveries meaningless for that patient. We then develop a Markov decision process model of the optimal time to initiate treatment, which incorporates uncertainty around the development of new therapies and their effects. After deriving structural properties for the model, we provide a numerical example that demonstrates how models that do not have any foresight of the RD pipeline may result in optimal policies that differ from models that have such foresight, implying erroneous decisions in the former models. Our example quantifies the effects of such errors.

The type of powder was taken as a criterion for the technology groups distinguishing in that way five groups of technologies for further research studies. Design/methodology/approach: In the framework of foresight-materials science researches: the dendrological matrix of technology value, the meteorological matrix of environment influence and the matrix of strategies for technology with the strategic development tracks were made, such researches as: X-ray microanalysis, qualitative X-ray analysis, hardness tests and roughness measurements were carried out under the scanning electron microscope and the light microscopy, as well as technology roadmaps were prepared. Findings: The outcarried researches pointed out very high potential and attractiveness of the given technologies in the background environment and the promising improvement of mechanical properties of examined materials. Research limitations/implications: Described materials science and foresight research concerning the cladding and remelting of carbides and oxides in the surface of casting magnesium alloys are a part of a wider research project aiming to define, examine and characterise innovative technology of surface engineering of engineering materials. Practical implications: The presented results of experimental materials science researches prove a significant positive effect of laser treatment with the use of carbides and oxides on the structure and properties of casting magnesium alloys that is why it is legitimate that they are included in the set of innovative technologies qualified for use in an industrial practice including small and medium enterprises. Originality/value: The value of this paper is to determine the value of laser treatment technology of casting magnesium alloys in the background environment with recommended procedure strategies, the strategic development tracks and technology roadmaps including the influence of this treatment on the quality, microstructure and properties of surface layers obtained by cladding and remelting casting magnesium alloys. © International OCSCO World Press.","Foresight; Laser surface treatment; Magnesium alloys; Manufacturing and processing; Technology roadmapping",,,,,,"(2008) The Handbook of Technology Foresight, , L.

These limitations relate to sufficient money essentiality in the sense of SCHEINKMAN [1980]. Thereby this paper departs from GUTIERREZ AND VAZQUEZ [2004] and contributes to the understanding of failure of the Cagan inflationary finance models with perfect foresight. Secondly, it shows that the inclusion of the goods market equilibrium condition calls into question the validity of explosive hyperinflationary paths as equilibrium paths in the cash-in-advance model. Two solutions are proposed to save the validity of explosive hyperinflation paths. © 2010 Mohr Siebeck.",,,,,,,"Barbosa, F.H., Cunha, A.B., Inflation Tax and Money Essentiality (2003) Economics Letters, 78, pp. 187-195; Barbosa, F.H., Cunha, A.B., Sallum, E.M., Competitive Equilibrium Hyperinflation under Rational Expectations (2006) Economic Theory, 29, pp. 181-195; (1937) The Economics of Inflation: A Study of Currency Depreci- Ation In Post-War Germany, pp. 1914-1923. , George Allen & Unwin: London; Cagan, P., The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation (1956) Studies In the Quantity Theory of Money, pp. 25-117. , in: M.

The information gained can then be used to decide whether to exercise real options. In the model the initial decisions involve a product design and the scale of production capacity. There are then real options to change these factors based on what is learned. The case of launching product variants in parallel is also considered. Under 'true' uncertainty, the model can be seen in terms of heuristic decision-making based on subjective beliefs with limited foresight. Search costs, the values of the real options, beliefs, and the cost of capital are all shown to be significant in determining the search path. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Feedback; Innovation; Learning; Real option; Search; Strategy",,,,,,"Chen, W., Miller, K., Situational and institutional determinants of firms' R&D search intensity (2007) Strategic Management Journal, 28, pp. 369-381; Childs, P., Ott, S., Triantis, A., Capital budgeting for interrelated projects: A real options approach (1998) Journal of Financial & Quantitative Analysis, 33, pp. 305-334; Childs, P., Triantis, A., Dynamic R&D investment policies (1999) Management Science, 45, pp. 1359-1377; Geroski, P.A., What do we know about entry?

The reissue of this remarkable work is therefore timely indeed. Its aim is to make the brilliance, foresight and clarity of Lachs' thinking once more easily accessible to a new generation of scholars.

But, because they are too greatly in thrall to the dominant paradigms and hence favour a linear perspective, the experts who deal with these questions pay more attention to the future of technologies than to scientific advances and revolutions. The bulk of their work consists, then, in anticipating, by various different methods (Delphi surveys, Roadmaps, etc.), at what date a particular technology might be available (without, however, always correctly gauging the conditions for its social appropriation or the applications to which it might be put). In this article, Pierre Papon expounds a much more original and promising approach for attempting to anticipate the discoveries that are likely radically to transform the fields of scientific knowledge by investigating the phenomena that may potentially lead to fundamental revolutions. After reminding us of the premonitory thinking of a number of authors -In the fields, for example, of genetics and computer science -, he endeavours to describe some of the dominant paradigms, particularly in quantum physics and molecular biology. In this way, he shows the advances they have made possible, and also their limitations, and explores what new scientific leaps forward might occur, bringing radically new technological breakthroughs between now and 2050. Papon reminds us, at the same time that, ""as science is not something isolated within society""; it has a duty to contribute to meeting the great challenges that face us -of work, health, nutrition and sustainable development, particularly where energy and climate are concerned. He therefore examines the ways in which future scientific and technological advances might provide solutions and how important it might be to ""translate the questions society poses into scientific questions"". He thus argues implicitly for strategic guidance of research, taking account of the challenges of the medium and long-term future, and, therefore, for a much closer dialogue between the sciences and society.",,,,,,,"Schrödinger, E., (1949) What Is Life?, p. 122. , Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1944 traduction française : Qu'est-ce que la vie?

Aznar and Ely describe its specific features and explain some elements of method, particularly distinguishing between the dynamic posture (a twostroke engine), which they dub a rapid, quantitative strategy, and the sensitive posture (a three-stroke engine), a ""hazy, slow, intuitive strategy"".

The failure of most futures markets for goods and services is compensated by firms (hierarchies), which are led by entrepreneurs in the sense of Knight (1921) who may be seen as surrogate forward traders of goods and services. We claim that the more realistic assumptions of New Institutional Economics, inter alia, provide a better perception of what takes place behind the veil of money and finance than neoclassical economics, and why it makes sense to occasionally limit liability and, as a consequence, apply forms of private or public regulation. It might also help to explain some aspects of the financial crisis of 2008. Copyright © 2010 T.M.C.

Based on this framework, two distinctive objectives of Kim Jong-il's regime in the North are identified: the development of nuclear weapons and regime succession by Kim Jong-il's family. To understand North Korea's strategy of brinkmanship, the author makes reference to the game of ""chicken"" to frame how Kim Jong-il attempts to signal to President Obama that North Korea is prepared to launch a nuclear strike against the U.S. and its allies.It is demonstrably the case that in playing games on a short-term basis, North Korea's Kim Jong-il and his supporters are acting as strategically as their American counterparts. However, they appear to lack foresight with regard to formulating long-term national strategies. The government of North Korea seems to believe that time is always on its side, which could account for its termination of diplomatic negotiations. While delaying the Six-Party Talks, North Korea's military leaders endeavored to expand and test their nuclear capabilities. It will be necessary for North Korea to change its game strategy in the future, as it becomes more apparent that Kim Jongil's leadership will not endure. © 2010 McFarland & Company, Inc.","continuous strategic-form game; extensive-form game; game of chicken; repeated brinkmanship strategy; Six-Party Talks",,,,,,"Chang, S., Should U.S. economic sanctions against North Korea be lifted?

Findings of a comparative analysis of the DIM for two PC manufacturers, Atech and Bymove, illustrate how business leaders combined foresight and insight with cyclical processes of resource integration, learning and transformation in delivering continuous innovation. We argue that the foresight of business leaders must be accompanied by insights about the development of the required capability for innovation, whereas the cycle of the building of dynamic capabilities must be linked with the business foresight for effective innovation.

The overarching program goal is graduation of a new pedigree of qualified engineers with the ""soft skills"", business acumen and strategic foresight, in addition to engineering prowess, to meet the needs of industry in the 21st century. Following the recommendation from James Duderstadt's ""Engineering for a Changing World"" [1], we propose a new paradigm for the education of the engineering leaders of the 21st century. The Duderstadt model mirrors the medical school training model that is credited with propelling advancement in medical practice during the last century, where the BS degree includes a broad-based curriculum of engineering design, project management, technology, ingenuity and innovation, along with business, communication, ethics, and social sciences. This foundation is then followed by post-graduate study, via a professional Master's degree program, in a specific discipline or concentration. The Leadership Engineering degree program is a first important, and viable, step towards that new paradigm. A large fraction of the graduates of the Leadership Engineering program are anticipated to pursue professional graduate degrees in a variety of engineering fields. Through a curriculum that provides a framework for building successful businesses, students graduating from the program may also move into the booming technology services sector or choose to start their own innovative companies. Finally, graduates of the Leadership Engineering program will be prepared to serve as leadership engineering educators in the K-12 sector, or for further graduate preparation in the expanding field of engineering education.","Curriculum; Engineering education; Entrepreneurship; K-12 education; Professional graduate program; Service industry; Soft skills","Entrepreneurship; Graduate program; K-12 education; Service industries; Soft skills; Biographies; Curricula; Education computing; Industry; Innovation; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Project management; Engineering education",,,,,"Duderstadt, J.J., (2008) Engineering for a Changing World, , http://milproj.dc.umich.edu/, Ann Arbor, Michigan, last access 02/11/10; Lattuca, L.R., Terenzini, P.T., Volkwien, J.F., (2006) Engineering Change: A Study of the Impact of EC2000, , Baltimore: ABET, Inc; Seagrave, R.C., (2006) Dual Level Accreditation of Engineering Programs, , Baltimore: ABET, Inc; Clough, C.W., (2004) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century, , Washington D.C.: National Academies Press; Beering, S.C., (2007) Moving Forward to Improve Engineering Education, , Washington D.C.: National Science Foundation; Sheppard, S.D., Mucatangay, K., Colby, A., Sullivan, W.M., (2008) Education Engineers: Designing for the Future of the Field, , Indianapolis: Jossey-Bass; McClure, G., (2007) Engineers As Commodities, , Today's Engineer; Giddins, D.P., (2008) Changing the Conversation: Messages for Improving Public Understanding of Engineering, , Washington D.C.: National Academies Press; King, C.J., (2006) Engineers Should Have a College Education, , http://cshe.berkeley.edu/, Center for Studies in Higher Education, University of California, Berkeley, CA, June last access 02/11/10; http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/spaces/ssme, last access 02/11/10; Paulson, L.D., (2006) Service Science: A New Field for Today's Economy, pp. 18-21. , Computer, August; http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=2206, last access 02/11/10; http://uteach.engr.utexas.edu/, last access 02/11/10; http://www.enge.vt.edu/, last access 02/11/10; http://www.asee.org/publications/jee/upload/EERC_intro_and_report.pdf, Special Report, The National Engineering Education Research Colloquies, and The Research Agenda for the New Discipline of Engineering Education, last access 02/11/10; http://www.lockheedmartinjobs.com/college_leadershipdev_engineering.asp, last access 02/11/10; Graham, R., Crawley, E., Mendelsohn, B.R., Engineering Leadership Education: A Snapshot Review of International Good Practice, , http://web.mit.edu/gordonelp/elewhitepaper.pdf, Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership Program, MIT, Boston, MA, last access 02/11/10; Problem Based Learning, , http://www.vu.edu.au/higher-ed-and-tafe/higher-education/ health-engineering-and-science/problem-based-learning, Melbourne, Australia, last access 02/11/10; General Education, Mission Statement, , http://www.registrar.clemson.edu/publicat/prevcats/0001/sections/gen_ed/ gened.htm, last access 02/11/10; Transformative Engineering Education: The What, How and Who, , http://www.slideshare.net/bjesiek/nsformative-engineering-education-the- what-how-and-who, last accessed 02/11/10; CASEE, Entry Portals, Projects and Affiliates, , http://www.nae.edu/Programs/CASEE/CASEE8677.aspx, last accessed 02/11/2010; Mission, Multidisciplinary Engineering Program, , https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Academics/Undergrad/mission, last accessed 02/11/2010; Lee, S.M., Riberio, D., Olsen, D.L., Roig, S., The importance of activities of service business in the economy: Welcome to the Service Business (2007) An International Journal of Service Business, 1, pp. 1-5. , http://resources.metapress.com/pdfpreview.axd?code=wnqp564409mv013j& size=largest, last accessed 02/11/2010; Program in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (PRIME), , http://www.engin.brown.edu/graduate/PRIME.htm, last accessed 02/11/2010; Program Overview, , http://www.seas.upenn.edu/entrepreneurship/overview.php, last accessed 02/11/2010; http://engineering.mit.edu/education/graduate/harvard.php, last cited 02/11/2010; Florman, S.C., (1996) The Introspective Engineer, , New York: Thomas Dunne, St. Martin's Press","Schoephoerster, R.

Design/methodology/approach: The article describes a set of validation, roadmapping and technology development methods in the part pertaining to the dendrological matrix of technology value, the meteorological matrix of environment influence, the matrix of strategies for technologies, the setting of strategic development tracks and creating technology roadmaps. Findings: The presented approach allows for organizing, enhancing and modernizing the process of testing as part of the technology foresight, with special consideration paid to material surface engineering. Research limitations/implications: The proposed general analyses purposefully omit the materials science part of the methodology which will be thoroughly presented in the series of articles currently prepared for print, on selected surface engineering technologies. The carried out works are part of a bigger research project aimed at generating a set of most promising surface engineering technologies. Practical implications: The described methods will be used to set priority innovative technologies in the field of material surface engineering; however, their universal character indicates they may be successfully used during the realization of any technology foresight and, after a slight adaptation-also an regional foresight. Originality/value: The value of the article is an example-supported presentation of an original authority set of methods for validation, roadmapping and forecasting the development of technologies, with special consideration paid to the field of material surface engineering. © Copyright by International OCSCO World Press.","Analysis and modelling; Foresight; Methodology of research; Technology roadmapping; Technology value and development",,,,,,"Report from the realization of 2nd task (2010) Analysis of the Existing Situation in Terms of the Development of Technologies and Social-Economic Conditions, , L.A.

The framework for the exemplification has been the Spanish case. The analysis of the Spanish CPPs in the last decade has included technology characterization and evolution and future foresights of electricity production. A total of 20 CPPs consisting of 39 operational coal power units (CPU) using pulverized fuel (PF) systems have been grouped in geographical zones. The available biomass (currently no utilised resources) in 100km area around the CPPs amoutns up to 72.5 PJ y-1. The changes caused by the differences of biomass as fuel have been reviewed, showing that using co-firing rates in the CPUs up to 10% in energy has shown to keep PF units under safe operation. Technical limitations have cut the biomass potential down to 36.5 PJ y-1, equivalent to a 5.4% co-firing rate. This figure is equivalent to a duplication of the current biomass installed power in Spain and to a contribution to the gap of the biomass national objectives of 67%. Economic analysis suggests that co-firing could be economically feasible by providing a bonus between 0.19 and 0.72 €cent per MJ of electricity, which turns into one sixth of the current bonus applied in Spain for electricity produced in biomass power plants.","Biomass resources; Co-fring Feasibility assessment; Coal combustion; Power generation","Biomass potential; Biomass power plants; Biomass resources; Co-firing; Coal power; Coal power plants; Electricity production; Feasibility assessment; Geographical zones; Installed power; Safe operation; Scientific papers; Technical limitations; Biomass; Coal; Coal deposits; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Electricity; Fossil fuel power plants; Program processors; Pulverized fuel; Rating; Coal combustion",,,,,"Resolution on Climate Change, , EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: P6-TA(2007) 0038, Strasbourg; (2007) An Energy Policy for Europe, , EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC): COM(2007) final, Brussels; Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Promotion of the use of Energy from Renewable Sources, 2008. , EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC):COM(2008)19 final, Brussels; Biomass Action Plan, 2005. , EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC),COM(2005)628 final, Brussels; First State-of-the-Art Report, Integrated European Network for Biomass Co-firing, , www.netbiocof.net, NETBIOCOF,NETBIOCOF), D14-2006.

It has no capacity for foresight or for recognizing collective goods. Its natural inclinations are to favor those with money over those in need, to exploit available resources rather than respect nature, to grow rather than develop. Meanwhile, encouragement of individual self-interest chews up the social fabric of trust, respect and mutual assistance upon which all lasting commerce and well-being depend. Society has always found it necessary to intervene to protect itself from raw market behavior. And as the recent round of government backstops, bailouts and boosts has revealed, society must often intervene to protect the market from itself.

On the basis of these scenarios it aims to draw a number of conclusions on the future of Sudan and the way ahead. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the Shell methodology for scenario building and is based on five scenario workshops held in Sudan, one in The Netherlands, interviews and literature research. The four scenarios not only intend to provide an overview of what is likely to happen, but also aim to be plausible, challenging and creative. Findings – The paper finds that the future of Sudan is likely to remain violent and that the most optimistic scenario is also the least likely. It concludes that, although outside mediation and assistance in the organization of elections are needed, the critical difference between a successful and an unsuccessful outcome will to a large extent be determined by whether the South has a stable, cooperative and confident leadership. Practical implications – The paper provides a number of policy recommendations for the international community to prevent the worst from happening and to be prepared for what may come. Originality/value – The paper aims to fill the gap in future foresight with regard to Sudan and for this purpose utilized the knowledge among the Sudanese themselves. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Conflict; Contingency planning; International politics; Sudan; War",,,,,,"De Waal, A., (2007) War in Darfur and the Search for Peace, Global Equity Initiative, , Harvard University and Justice Africa, Cambridge, MA and London; De Waal, A., Mission without end?

Then with the help of SPSS tools, we use the principal component and cluster analysis model (PCA-CA) to do the objective and subjective evaluation on the 16 information and communication technologies (ICT) of the Olympic science and technology (S&T) projects. First, this method has reflected the non-linear relationship between the evaluation results and the index system, and reduced the participation and workload of the experts, so it reduces the subjectivity of the evaluation and has greatly enhanced the efficiency and scientific of emerging technology evaluation. Second, the evaluation results have a certain referential value, which can help business and management departments make policy decisions. © 2010 IEEE.","Cluster analysis (CA); Emerging technology; Evaluation; Industrialization potential; Principal component analysis (PCA)","Business and management; Degree of uncertainty; Emerging technologies; Evaluation; Evaluation results; Index systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Non-linear relationships; Olympics; Policy decisions; Principal Components; Science and Technology; Subjective evaluations; Technology foresight; Technology managements; Cluster analysis; Computer simulation; Data handling; Industrial management; Industry; Technology; Principal component analysis",,,,,"Day, G.S., Schoemaker, P.J.H., (2002) Wharton on Managing Emerging Technologies, , Huaxia Press, Beijing; Moncada-Paternò-Castello, P., Rojo, J., Bellido, F., Fiore, F., Tubke, A., Early Identification and Marketing of Innovative Technologies: A Case Study of RTD Result Valorization at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (2003) Technovation, 23, pp. 655-667; Moncada-Paterno, P., Castello, Rojo, J., Bellido, F., (1999) IPTS-TIM-Software V.1.1-A Tool to Help Experts Evaluate the Marketability Potential of New Technologies, , European commission- IPTS-TIM; Chan, F.T.S., Chan, M.H., Tang, N.K.H., Evaluation methodologies for technology selection (2000) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 107 (1-3), pp. 330-337; Sohn, S.Y., Moon, T.H., Structural equation-model for predicting technology commercialization success index (2003) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 70, pp. 885-899; Park, Y., Park, G., A new method for technology valuation in monetary value: Procedure and application (2004) Technovation, 24 (5), pp. 387-394; Allan, G., Boehlje, M., Fulton, J., Agricultural innovation and new ventures: Assessing the commercial potential (2004) Amer.

That study consisted of four experiments investigating foresight in chimpanzees and orangutans, examining in particular whether the planning they exhibit is best explained by assuming an episodic cognitive system. This system has widely been regarded as exclusive to humans. Indeed, the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis explicitly states that planning for a future need is outside the abilities of non-humans. In our paper, we argued that the results implied the presence of episodic abilities and challenged the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis. Suddendorf et al. are not ready to accept this claim. They critique each experiment in detail and maintain their view that episodic cognition is unique to humans. Here, I point out the misapprehensions and weaknesses in their critique notably a lack of appreciation for how the experiments in the study are interrelated and serve as controls for each other and for the baseline experiment.

So corporate leaders need to understand when to adapt the business model and how to execute the change. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: Data from IBM's Global CEO Study 2008 and an analysis of 28 successful business-model innovators, produced insights into both the best timing and process for business model innovation. Findings: The IBM researchers identified a set of characteristics that strong business-model innovators demonstrate consistently. Practical implications: A set of characteristics, which the IBM researchers call the ""Three A's,"" are critical to the successful design and execution of business-model innovation: Aligned - Leverage core capabilities and design consistency across all dimensions of the business model, both internally and externally, that build customer value; Analytical - Use information strategically to create foresight, and prioritize actions while measuring and tracking for rapid course correction; and Adaptable - Link innovative leadership with the ability to effect change and institutionalize operational flexibility.

The Italian downstream sector is challenged by the European Union's energy strategy, which aims to cut € 60 billion of oil and gas imports over the next 10 years. The new refineries and petrochemical complexes are generating fierce price competition, both because they employ the most advanced production technologies and because they are either located close to inexpensive feedstock or close to a region of booming demand such as the whole Asia pacific area, with China and India as prime examples. Italy is well served by its bountiful store of expert technical and project management expertise, by its experienced business leaders with the foresight, flexibility and courage to deal with the industry's complexities, and by the advanced technologies that are available to address the critical issues of cost, quality and emissions performance.",,,,,,,,"Greco, G.; GE Oil and GasItaly",,,,,,,,14689340,,HYENF,,"English","Hydrocarbon.

It argues that emotional events, as appraised by the individual, elicit changes in motive states (called states of action readiness), which in turn may (or may not) cause action. Actions can be elicited automatically, without prior intention (called impulsive actions), or intentionally. Impulsive actions reflect the simplest and biologically most general form in which emotions can cause action, since they require no reflection, no foresight, and no planning. Impulsive actions are determined conjointly by the nature of action readiness, the affordances perceived in the eliciting event as appraised, and the individual's action repertoire. Those actions from one's repertoire are performed that both match the perceived affordances and the aim of the state of action readiness. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Action readiness; Emotion; Impulsive action; Motivation","anticipation; arousal; article; association; attention; aversive behavior; cognition; emotion; facial expression; impulsiveness; motivation; object relation; priority journal; reinforcement; social environment; stimulus response; thinking; Arousal; Emotions; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Models, Psychological; Motivation",,,,,"Barrett, L.F., Emotions as natural kinds?

However, there is still a lack of deep understanding of how to reduce perceived risk and improve personal motivation on the adoption of KRSs in previous research. The paper presents social-psychological-technical perspectives to integrate social factors of reduced perceived risk (trust and organizational support) into Motivation Model (MM) and develop a comprehensive framework for assessing and analyzing the interaction of technology with the social, psychological, and behavioral aspects in KRSs. The proposed framework is validated with 528 respondents from teaching hospitals located in Taiwan, which shows that social factors of reduced perceived risk, personal motivation factors, and technology quality factors are three key factors affecting the acceptance of the KRSs. In other words, technological, social, psychological aspects will affect simultaneously behavioral intention in KRSs. Moreover, the psychological aspects are important mediators among technological, social, and behavioral aspects. The findings may be used as theoretical base for future research and offer empirical foresight to managers of organizations in assessing and evaluating the performance of the KRSs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Knowledge repository systems;

The question addressed by this paper is whether such deviations are due to price discovery errors which will eventually vanish or due to inherent inefficiencies in the auction structure.We show that even with perfect foresight of average congestion rents the clearing prices for the FTRs depend on the bid quantity and therefore may not be priced correctly in the financial transmission right (FTR) auction. In particular, we prove that quantity limits on the FTR bids may cause the auction clearing prices to differ from the bid prices. This phenomenon which is inherent in the theoretical properties of the optimization algorithm used to clear the auction, is further illustrated through numerical simulations with test systems. We conclude that price discovery alone would not remedy the discrepancy between the auction prices and the realized values of the FTRs. Secondary markets or frequent reconfiguration auctions are necessary in order to achieve such convergence. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Electricity auction; Financial transmission right; Simultaneous feasibility; Transmission pricing","Clearing price; Congestion revenue; Congestion revenue rights; Electricity auctions; Empirical evidence; Financial transmission right; Independent system operators; New York; Numerical simulation; Optimization algorithms; Price discovery; Secondary market; Simultaneous feasibility; Test systems; Transmission pricing; Commerce; Computer simulation; Economics; Electric utilities; Mathematical operators; Costs; algorithm; electricity; feasibility study; optimization; price determination",,,,,"Adamson, S., Englander, S., Efficiency of the transmission congestion contract auction (2005) The Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Science (HICSS38), Big Island, Hawaii; Adamson, S., Noe, T., Parker, G., Efficiency of financial transmission rights markets in centrally-coordinated periodic auctions (2008) Working Paper.

People may need help of their relatives to activities of daily living in order to survive at one stage of life. Both the foresight that the burden of care is too severe to cope with and the fact that all states have social responsibilities underlined the importance of regulations to support families although traditionally people are responsible for caring their ill relatives. In recent years, attempts to support people in need of care have increased in Turkey. The Disability Law was enacted in 2005 and it was modified in 2006. The statutes regulating selection of disabled people in need of care were also issued in 2007. The Disability Law and the statutes, for the first time, made it possible for people taken care of by formal and informal caregivers to receive care allowance. Care allowance for formal and informal care at home has underlined ethical principles. It provides formal and informal caregivers with financial support. However, it is still debatable whether caregivers should be paid by governments. In this article, the scope and effects of the Disability Law and the relevant statutes will be evaluated and ethical and medico-legal problems likely to appear in practice will be discussed.","Care allowance and ethics; Home care; People in need of care","caregiver; community care; daily life activity; disability; economic aspect; ethics; financial management; government; home care; human; law; medicolegal aspect; patient care; population structure; review; social behavior; social care; social evolution; Turkey (republic)",,,,,"Coyne, A.C., Reichman, W.E., Berbig, L.J., The relationship between dementia and elder abuse (1993) American Journal Psychiatry, 150, pp. 643-646; Bapbakanlýk Özürlüler Ýdaresi Bapkanlýoý, , www.ozida.gov.tr, Ýstismarý Önlemek Devletin Öncelioidir; Brodsky, J., Habib, J., Mizrahi, I., (2000) Long- Term Care Laws in Five Developed Countries, , A Review, JDC Brookdale Institute of Gerontology and Human Development, Jerusalem, World Health Organization; Review of Pricing Arrangements in Residential Aged Care, Long Term Aged Care (2003) International Perspectives, (3), p. 127. , Commonwealth of Australia; Background Paper; Francis, J., Netten, A., Raising the Quality of Home Care: A Study of Service Users' Views (2004) Social Policy and Administration, 38 (3), pp. 290-305. , June; Garcia, T., Ethics in Home Care (2006) Home Health Care Management & Practice, 18 (2), pp. 133-137; Gibson, J.M., Gregory, R.S., Pandya, M.S., Long-Term Care in Developed Nations:A Brief Overview (2003) AARP Public Policy, pp. 25-26. , October; Gross, M.A., Payments for Care: The Case of Israel (1994) Payment for Care, a Comparative Overview, p. 296. , Edit; Evers A; Pijl M; Ungerson C, European Centre Vienna, Avebury; Horfmarcher, M.M., Riedel, M., Development of age structure in the EU: The EU is ageing: even when expanding eastward.

Impacts are, however, associated with substantial uncertainties. This paper studies an uncertainty-robust adaptation strategy: strengthening the resilience of the impacted system. This approach is operationalised for the city of Rotterdam, using literature study, interviews, and a workshop. Potential impacts have been explored using national climate statistics and scenarios and a set of 'wildcards' (imaginable surprises). Sea level rise, particularly in combination with storm surge, and enduring heat and drought are the most relevant potential stresses in the area. These can lead to damage, loss of image, and societal disruption. Unclear responsibilities enhance disruption. 'Resilience principles' made the concept of resilience sufficiently operational for local actors to explore policy options. Useful principles for urban resilience include: homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, redundancy, foresight and preparedness/planning, compartmentalisation, and flexible planning/design. A resilience approach makes the system less prone to disturbances, enables quick and flexible responses, and is better capable of dealing with surprises than traditional predictive approaches. Local actors frame resilience as a flexible approach to adaptation that would be more suitable and tailored to local situations than rigid top-down regulations. In addition to a change in policy, it would require a more pro-active mentality among the population. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change adaptation; Resilience; Resilience principles; Uncertainty; Urban planning","Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Climate statistics; Coastal cities; High flux; Omnivory; Planning/Design; Policy options; Potential impacts; Potential stress; Rotterdam; Sea level rise; Storm surges; Topdown; Uncertain climate; Urban resilience; Laws and legislation; Population statistics; Sea level; Urban planning; Climate change; climate change; coping strategy; policy strategy; resilience; top-down approach; uncertainty role; urban planning; Netherlands; Rotterdam; South Holland",,,,,"Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. contribution of working group II to the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (2007) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), , IPCC, Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, New York, M.L.

COST is an intergovernmental framework composed of 35 countries, allowing the coordination of research that is otherwise funded on a European level, through the provision of platforms for European scientists to cooperate on a particular project and exchange expertise. As a precursor of advanced multidisciplinary research, COST contributes to reducing the fragmentation in European research investments and to opening the European Research Area to cooperation worldwide. It anticipates and complements the activities of the EU Framework Programmes, constituting a bridge towards the scientific communities of emerging countries. It also increases the mobility of researchers across Europe, fostering the establishment of scientific excellence (see www.cost.esf.org). COST Foresight 2030 was an initiative designed to explore a broadly-shared vision for a future world beyond 2030, permeated and shaped by the digital revolution. It consisted of a set of events presenting long-term perspectives in the selected fields - Information and Communication Technologies/Computer and Communication Sciences and Technologies (ICT/CCST), Energy, Food Security, Natural Resources Management, Life Enhancement and Society - which play fundamental roles in human life and which are envisaged to be highly influenced by ICT/CCST-enabling technologies. The workshop Living the Digital Revolution: The European Society in 2030, the concluding one of the six workshops of the initiative, gathered 20 distinguished scholars and experts from Europe and beyond (AU, NZ, US) for an exploratory brainstorming session. Representing various fields in the social sciences and humanities, such as sociology, education and learning, future studies, law and ethics, economics and business, demography and ICT, the experts focused on the possible trajectories of European societies with regard to the accelerating advancements in ICT/CCST leading up to 2030.

The third argument is our own and, to that extent, we seek to defend it. The first argument is that end-of-life decisions do not in fact shorten lives and that therefore there is no need for the doctrine in justification of these decisions. We reject this argument; some end-of-life decisions clearly shorten lives. The second is that the doctrine of double effect is not recognized in UK law (and similar jurisdictions); therefore, clinicians cannot use it as the basis for justification of their decisions. Against this we suggest that while the doctrine might have dubious legal grounds, it could be of relevance in some ways, e.g. in marking the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable practice in relation to the clinician's duty to relieve pain and suffering. The third is that the doctrine is irrelevant because it requires there to be a bad effect that needs justification. This is not the case in end-of-life care for patients diagnosed as dying. Here, bringing about a satisfactory dying process for a patient is a good effect, not a bad one. What matters is that patients die without pain and suffering. This marks a crucial departure from the double-effect doctrine; if the patient's death is not a bad effect then the doctrine is clearly irrelevant. A diagnosis of dying allows clinicians to focus on good dying and not to worry about whether their intervention affects the time of death. For a patient diagnosed as dying, time of death is rarely important. In our conclusion we suggest that acceptance of our argument might be problematic for opponents of physician-assisted death. We suggest one way in which these opponents might argue for a distinction between such practice and palliative care; this relies on the double-effect doctrine's distinction between foresight and intention. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Diagnosis of dying; Doctrine of double effect; End-of-life; Ethics; Euthanasia; Physician-assisted death","narcotic analgesic agent; article; assisted suicide; conscious sedation; decision making; ethics; euthanasia; human; legal aspect; medical ethics; terminal care; time; United Kingdom; conscious sedation; decision making; ethics; legislation and jurisprudence; terminal care; Analgesics, Opioid; Choice Behavior; Conscious Sedation; Decision Making; Double Effect Principle; Euthanasia; Great Britain; Humans; Suicide, Assisted; Terminal Care; Time Factors; Analgesics, Opioid; Choice Behavior; Conscious Sedation; Decision Making; Double Effect Principle; Euthanasia; Great Britain; Humans; Suicide, Assisted; Terminal Care; Time Factors",,"Analgesics, Opioid; Analgesics, Opioid",,,"Beauchamp, T., Childress, J., (2001) Principles of Biomedical Ethics, , Oxford University Press, New York; (2007) Withholding and Withdrawing Life-Prolonging Medical Treatment: Guidance for Decision Making, , British Medical Association, 3rd, edn., Blackwell, Oxford; Carr, M.F., Mohr, G.J., Palliative sedation as part of a continuum of palliative care (2008) Journal of Palliative Medicine, 11 (1), pp. 76-81; Cavanaugh, T., The intended/foreseen distinction's ethical relevance (1996) Philosophical Papers, 25 (3), pp. 179-188; Cavanaugh, T., (2006) Double-Effect Reasoning: Doing Good and Avoiding Evil, , Clarendon Press, Oxford; Chappell, T., Two distinctions that do make a difference: the action/omission distinction and the principle of double effect (2002) Philosophy, 77 (2), pp. 211-233; De Graeff, A., Dean, M., Palliative sedation therapy in the last weeks of life: a literature review and recommendations for standards (2007) Journal of Palliative Medicine, 10 (1), pp. 67-85; (2008) End of Life Care Strategy, , Department of Health, Department of Health, London; (2003) Care of the Dying: A Pathway to Excellence, , Ellershaw J, Wilkinson S. eds, Oxford University Press, Oxford; Ellershaw, J., Ward, C., Neuberger, J., Care of the dying patient: the last hours or days of life (Commentary) (2003) British Medical Journal, 326 (7379), pp. 30-34; Forbes, K., Huxtable, R., Clarifying the data on double effect (2006) Palliative Medicine, 20 (4), pp. 395-396; Gillon, R., When doctors might kill their patients: foreseeing is not necessarily the same as intending (1999) BMJ (Clinical Research Ed, 318 (7196), pp. 1431-1432; Good, P.D., Ravenscroft, P.J., Cavenagh, J., Effects of opioids and sedatives on survival in an australian inpatient palliative care population (2005) Internal Medicine Journal, 35 (9), pp. 512-517; Grubb, A., (2004) Principles of Medical Law, , ed., 2nd, edn., OUP, Oxford; Mental Capacity Act (2006), http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2005/ukpga_20050009_en_1, HMSO, [online].

Such premises, which are usually embedded in foresight studies, are contrasted with sociological imagination and contemporary social science discourse. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a conceptual analysis of theoretical assumptions embedded in foresight studies. Findings: Sociological lenses, including concepts like anticipation, latency, time, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity, change and plurality of images, offer clarity in terms of both futures studies and foresights. Research limitations/implications: Explicating presumptions embedded in foresight methods helps recognition of how such methods shape the concepts of future and time. This is vital for assessment of the analytical products of foresights studies. Originality/value: This research contributes to the ambition of linking the theoretical world of futures research and the practical world of foresights closer together by explicating key concepts and implicit assumptions in both fields. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Epistemology; Forecasting; Philosophy; Sociology",,,,,,"Beck, U., Giddens, A., Lash, S., (1994) Reflexive Modernization.

This paper aims at using a debate that took place in a specific foresight discussion arena on early detection and weak signal analysis, as a constructive epistemic detour to eventually contribute to such a reinforcement of Rosen's anticipatory system proposal. Design/methodology/approach: The author aims at revisiting Rosen's framework with stimulating inputs drawing upon the early detection debates, by first assessing the original concepts brought up by Ansoff in the 1970s and 1980s and its further enhancements by contemporary scholars. A rather constructivist approach is then developed to weak signal analysis, aiming at emphasising the need, in analytical situations involving social system features, for reflexive stages and capacities. Bearing this requirement in mind, the productive value of the framing and meta-framing notions is explored, in order to apply them to Rosen's anticipatory systems and possibly contribute to enriching his original concept. Findings: How effective the framing and meta-framing couple can be for a series of anticipatory issues is described in a detailed manner and, then more specifically, Rosen's anticipatory system concept is revisited in the light of those inputs, aiming at putting into perspective new options for research and anticipation activities in general. Research limitations/implications: The paper is essentially conceptual and based on a rich but disputable detour by early detection and weak analysis issues so as to emphasise key reflexive references and method. However, most of this material is taken from domains rather untypical of Rosennean debates and in addition would need to be completed by a series of supportive cases, but that is beyond the scope and scale of this paper. Practical implications: The paper sets clear distinctions and boundaries for when and when not to apply reflexive steps in a foresight exercise, including in the context of rolling out a Rosen type of approach. Research decision making both in the corporate and policy-making contexts can benefit from such clues and supportive framework conditions. Social implications: Social systems are typically complex and involve multiple perspectives and viewpoints; they concern a series of major challenges to be coped with locally or more globally, at environmental, political, cultural or technological level, and in that category of anticipatory endeavor, the framing/meta-framing epistemic couple may be of great usefulness. Originality/value: Although rather conceptual, the detour proposed by the paper aims at creating a reflexive distance and enriched capability to evaluate one's potential biases and blind spots in anticipatory modelling activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Communication technologies; Complexity theory; Environmental management; Governance; Innovation",,,,,,"Adam, B., Has the future already happened?

The science instrument is a focusing X-ray telescope developed by Caltech. Mission operations are conducted at Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, and science operations at Caltech. Integrated software systems provided by the mission operations team support all phases of NuSTAR instrument and spacecraft development, observatory integration, and environmental testing. Required simulators, prototype modules, and flight and ground systems interfaces are introduced into the development and test environment early in the project to closely match to on-orbit operations. This test-like-you-fly philosophy demands foresight and disciplined development at the earliest stages of project, but reduces cost and risk throughout the project life cycle by streamlining workflows and preventing interface problems at later stages. It also provides an excellent training environment and essentially guarantees a smooth transition to on-orbit operations. This paper reports on the progress and first successes of the NuSTAR team with the taken approach. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Caltech; Ground systems; High energy; Integrated software system; Interface problems; Low-Earth orbit; Mission operations; On-orbit; Project life cycle; Science operations; Small explorer missions; Smooth transitions; Space science; Spacecraft development; Test Environment; University of California , Berkeley; Work-flows; X ray telescope; Astrophysics; Buildings; Computer software; Cost reduction; Environmental testing; Instrument testing; NASA; Observatories; Orbits; Philosophical aspects; Spacecraft; Telescopes; Space flight",,,,,"Bester, M., Lewis, M., Roberts, B., Croton, L., Dumlao, R., Eckert, M., McDonald, J., Clemons, T., Ground Systems and Flight Operations of the THEMIS Constellation Mission (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference, , Ed Bryan (ed.), Big Sky, MT, March 1-8 Paper 12.0502; Angelopoulos, V., Sibeck, D., (2008) THEMIS and ARTEMIS, , Proposal submitted to NASA/HQ for the Mission Operations and Data Analysis Program of the Heliophysics Operating Missions, University of California, February; Pfarr, B., Donohue, J., Lui, B., Greer, G., Green, T., Proven and Robust Ground Support Systems - GSFC Success and Lessons Learned (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference, , Big Sky, MT, March 1-8, Paper 12.0504; http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/; Bester, M., Lewis, M., Roberts, B., McDonald, J., Pease, D., Thorsness, J., Frey, S., Rummel, D., THEMIS Operations (2008) Space Science Reviews, 141, pp. 91-115. , Dordrecht: Springer; Bester, M., Stroozas, B., Telemetry and Command Frame Routing in a Multi-mission Environment Proceedings of the 42nd International Telemetering Conference (ITC), Las Vegas, NV, October 22-25, 2007; Recommended Standards, , http://www.ccsds.org, Blue Books, Reston, VA; http://subversion.tigris.org/; McGrath, M.T., The Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere Mission (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference, , Ed Bryan (ed.), Big Sky, MT, March 7-14 Paper 2.0401","Marchant, W.; Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, 7 Gauss Way, Berkeley, CA 94720-7450, United States; email: marchant@ssl.berkeley.edu",,"Aerospace and Electronics Systems Society",,"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","6 March 2010 through 13 March 2010","Big Sky, MT",80381,1095323X,9781424438884,,,"English","IEEE Aerosp.

However, in order to avoid hypes - and subsequent disappointments - about what foresight can deliver, the potential contributions to decision-making processes by foresight should be clearly understood. The article puts foresight into this broader context of policy-making processes, with a particular emphasis on innovation policy. It describes the evolution of different policy rationales since the 1960s, develops a framework to classify the impacts of various types of prospective analyses, and reviews the evaluation results of several national foresight programmes by using this framework. On that basis, future directions of how foresight might evolve are considered to spur discussions. © Beech Tree Publishing 2010.",,,,,,,"Arnold, E., Faugert, S., Eriksson, A., Charlet, V., (2005) From Foresight to Consensus?

This would make it not only faster but also more accurate. We demonstrate, using a large sample of 2500 put options, that the proposed algorithm - the perfect foresight method (PFM) - is, as argued by the authors, faster than the LSMC algorithm but, contrary to what they state, it is not more accurate than the LSMC. In fact, the PFM algorithm incorrectly prices American options.

The main results are that if policy had been conducted by means of a Volcker-type rule, it would have been uniformly more restrictive; and if it had been conducted by means of a Greenspan-type rule, it would have been less restrictive. These results are robust to the introduction of real-time data. The paper also evaluates the impact of inflation uncertainty on monetary policy. Real-time Greenbook inflation forecasts reveal that, during the great inflation period, the Fed's staff believed that monetary policy was more restrictive than it turned out to be with the benefit of hindsight.

Many problems requiring maintenance and repair could have been mitigated or prevented with a little foresight and coordination during the design and construction period. Why is so much effort expended on ""repairing the repairs""? This paper discusses how common mistakes occur and why. Many of the perceived restraints on the design and construction phases such as time, budget, level of craftsmanship, and material costs do and should affect the project. However, these constraints must be balanced against the functionality of the masonry, such as durability, structural stability, weather barrier, and aesthetics. Through real-life examples, this paper describes a simple repair of rehabilitation process that will lead to a successful project outcome: Long lasting, low maintenance masonry structures. It takes into account the owner's needs, priorities, and budgetary, physical, and time constraints before any design development or repair begins. For comparison, unsuccessful project outcomes from actual projects will also be explored.

Despite the fact that publication/launch dates of the first books/research projects on Futures Studies go back to few decades ago, it is only in the past few years that promotion of this discipline has gained momentum. Our aim in this paper is to present an overview of the development of Futures Studies in Iran since 1960s. We briefly explore the history of Futures Studies in Iran and explain why it has taken a technocratic line, as opposed to other possibilities (e.g. corporatist, environmentalists, citizen visioning (anticipatory democracy), etc.). In particular, we present an analysis of an ongoing and comprehensive foresight project whose objective is to provide Iranian top decision makers with a set of scenarios concerning future developments in a number of areas of science and technology until 2025. The main argument of the paper is that in response to the demands made by the policymakers, Iranian scholars, academics and technologists are trying to equip themselves with the latest techniques and know how for long-term planning and vision-building. However, due to various limitations the ride has not been an easy one. To overcome the obstacles, those who are at the forefront of developing indigenous versions of technological and theoretical aspects of Futures Studies have resorted to the method of trial and error and learning through doing. The paper critically examines the weaknesses and points of strength of this approach in the context of Iran. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"academic research; decision making; future prospect; historical perspective; learning; planning method; research work; science and technology; technological development; technology policy; Iran",,,,,"Empiricus, S., (1933) Outlines of Pyrrhonism, , (trans.: R.G.

The microstructure is able to provide an overview of the product obtained by a given set of process variables and is directly related to the final properties of sintered object. In fact, ""performance"" of a sintered steel component depends on the properties associated with its microstructure, ie distribution, volume fraction, porosity size and morphology and microstructure of the various constituents that make up a section of the macroscopic component obtained from certain powder and with specific process conditions. The final microstructure depends on the nature of the materials and process technologies, but can be used to develop optimum properties of the sintered part through the same process changes suggested by metallographic inspection. It is then necessary: • know the typical microstructures of sintered steels, • understand the microstructure- property relationship, • to relate the microstructural evolution with different process patterns to which several types of steels are subjected. The metallography will use different experimental techniques. Even in its simplest form, specimen preparation and optical microscopy, metallographic examination is a powerful and inexpensive way, for the development and control of the process and properties of the sintered product. The metallographic analysis has two basic stages: • selection and preparation of significant and appropriate samples to highlight the microstructure • microstructures interpretation. Both these stages are critical. The sample must be taken to be significant; figure 2 shows an example of a sintered component sampling. Subsequently the specimens are usually embedded into polymer resins of various kinds cold or hot curing. The choice of resin depend on the metallurgical state of specimen and examination which is intended. The specimen grinding and polishing is done with the traditional mechanical cleaning first using discs or abrasive paper and finally with cloths and diamond spray increasingly fine-grained (from 6 to 3 microns, 1 and 0.25 microns). However it is necessary to use some foresight more than for bulk materials on cleaning, since the porosity as well as its morphology and distribution are constitutional important factors for the properties definition of sintered component: the cleaning process must not alter porosity in any way. Pressure cleaning should be reduced, especially since the metal matrix is tender. Good specimens preparation also involves passing through ultrasound washing both after each intermediate stage of polishing both and at the end of the procedure to remove residual cleaning material and any oxides formed inside the pores during the same cleaning process. After polishing metallographic examination must be conducted first without etching and then after etching. Metallographic analysis without etching identifies the oxides presence, inclusions, cracks... and can measure the quantity, distribution and morphology of the pores (eg Figure 3). After viewing without etching, the specimen is generally etched with Nital 1%; the sinter-hardened microstructures may want a further etching with picric acid in alcohol. Etching highlights phases and microstructural constituents present, their morphology and distribution, grain structure, chemical composition heterogeneity of solid solution... Morphological and chemical homogeneity of the microstructure can give an idea of sintering degree achieved. Figure 4 shows the microstructure obtained after Nital 1% etching of a steel of composition 0.5% C, 2.5% Cu, bal. Fe, sintered at 1120°C for 30 minutes in endogas atmosphere. The microstructure mainly consists of ferrite whose joints are often highlighted by cementite ribbons and pearlite. The micrograph also highlights the heterogeneity of distribution of Cu more concentrated near the pores where the ferrite appears darker. Figure 5 shows the microstructure of a sintered steel of composition C 0.1, Cu 2.5, 0.5 MnS, Fe bal. In this case the ferrite is the predominant constituent, it is evident the heterogeneity of concentration of copper (areas darker near the pores whose colour intensity decreases towards the interior of grain). The material was then subjected to steam treatment: the results are shown in figure 6, 7 and 8. With electron microscopy examination (figure 8), are well defined the characteristics of the surface oxide layer which is actually composed of two layers: an outer very porous and an inner expanded and compact. Detailed information can be obtained with the electron microscope to study the process, but the simple optical microscopy examination, if properly implemented, can provide the information necessary to manage the process. The following figures show the power of microstructural examination to characterize several sintered steels in different process conditions: a lot of microstructures are described and information for their interpretation are suggested.

Not only does the cosmopolitan perspective help to understand the ways in which science and society are mutually constructing the phenomenon of climate change, it also offers us a way of asking 'what can climate change do for us?' rather than 'what can we do for climate change?'

This article offers an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the procedure, as well as the synthesis of a metaevaluative revision of the evaluation for teacher individual incentives, promoted by autonomous goverments, that have been generalized in Spanish universities in the last six- eight years. This period of application, in spite of the great diversity among autonomous communities and universities, seems a sufficient period of time to carry on a metaevaluation of the process and its impact and, as much as possible, to offer potential improvement actions. This metaevaluation, an external revision study with several sources and methods and formative orientation, synthesize the situation of the applied models in different autonomous communities, their strengths and weaknesses, their impact on teachers and universities, the evaluation that different implicated sectors made and the change proposals that are suggested.

We point beyond the well-tilled ground of foresight as commonly practiced (called Foresight 1.0) to an emerging understanding of the work and character of foresight (called Foresight 2.0). By definition, as of today, this new territory is not well mapped, much less carefully worked-over. The question that drives this commitment to Foresight 2.0 was the heart of the 2007 Strathclyde Organizational Foresight Conference-Learning the Future Faster: "" Can foresight as commonly practiced enable us to learn the future fast enough to meet and deal with the unique strategic challenges of the 21st Century?"" The view taken is that Foresight 1.0 cannot meet this challenge; that it leads to small victories and major disasters. An explanation is offered: Foresight 1.0 was developed, and is still largely practiced, with the eyes and mind of management, whereas sustained success in the unique conditions of the 21st Century requires Foresight 2.0-seeing, thinking and acting with the eyes and mind of Leadership. This distinction is explained. Evidence is offered that futures research and foresight are slowly moving towards this new practice. The hope is expressed that, if we grasp the need for it, the nature of it and have explicit mental maps of the journey to it, we who are professional foresight researchers and practitioners will move faster and more effectively to develop Foresight 2.0. Several steps towards this end are outlined. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"future prospect; organizational framework; planning practice; strategic approach",,,,,"The characteristics and frustrations of programmatic pieces are well known.

However, there are remaining barriers that impede a wider implementation of foresight. In particular, the necessities to deal with the future, anticipate change, enhance participation and reduce costs and complexity call for new methods to improve current foresight activities. In this paper, we introduce prediction markets to the field of foresight. Prediction markets are a structured approach to collect and aggregate information from groups and have recently gained attention in forecasting. Prediction markets go beyond simple forecasting and can contribute to foresight by providing advantages in terms of continuous and real-time information aggregation, motivation of participation and information revelation as well as cost-efficiency and scalability. We suggest four promising fields of application for prediction markets to enhance foresight: (1) continuous forecasting and environmental scanning, (2) combining with deliberative approaches, (3) continuous idea generation and (4) expert identification. We conclude by considering prediction markets as a nascent and promising method for foresight and advocate for further research. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"business development; cost-benefit analysis; forecasting method; future prospect; organizational framework; planning method; prediction; real time; research work",,,,,"Slaughter, R.A., Foresight beyond strategy: social initiatives by business and government (1996) Long Range Planning, 29, pp. 156-163; Burt, G., Wright, G., "" Seeing"" for organisational foresight (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 887-893; Tsoukas, H., Shepherd, J., Coping with the future: developing organizational foresightfulness (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 137-144; Martin, B.R., Foresight in science and technology (1995) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 7, pp. 139-168; Reger, G., Technology foresight in companies: from an indicator to a network and process perspective (2001) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 13, pp. 533-553; Slaughter, R.A., Futures studies: from individual to social capacity (1996) Futures, 28, pp. 751-762; Hayek, F.A., The use of knowledge in society (1945) American Economic Review, 35, pp. 519-530; Schwarz, J.O., Assessing the future of futures studies in management (2008) Futures, 40, pp. 237-246; Popper, S.W., Lempert, R.J., Bankes, S.C., Shaping the future (2005) Scientific American, 292, pp. 66-71; Cuhls, K., From forecasting to foresight processes - new participative foresight activities in Germany (2003) Journal of Forecasting, 22, pp. 93-111; Cunha, M.P., Palma, P., da Costa, N.G., Fear of foresight: knowledge and ignorance in organizational foresight (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 942-955; van der, K., Heijden, Can internally generated futures accelerate organizational learning?

The research was aimed at exploring the potential role of foresight in the development of the Brussels Capital Region and the identification of tools, capabilities and conditions for an improved application of foresight in Brussels. An overview was created of the characteristics of 60 future oriented activities and 120 organisations involved in such activities At the outset questions on organisational or institutional fragmentation and collaboration were not intended to be in the foreground of the research but over the course of the research this issue was observed to have a significant adverse impact on foresight capacity in Brussels. The case of the Brussels Capital Region demonstrates that institutional and organisational fragmentation need to be overcome for a futures oriented practice to have opportunity. De-fragmentation, bottom-up and institutionally, is both a condition for and an effect of the futures oriented practice underlying the foresight capacity of organisations. © 2009.",,"forecasting method; regional development; research program; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium]",,,,,"(2007) Steun aan universiteiten en Hoge Scholen, , http://www.irsib.irisnet.be/universites_nl.htm, IRSIB; Johnston, R., http://forlearn.jrc.es/guide/9_key-terms/foresight.htm, available from ; Downey, L., Heydebreck, P., Foresight and the transition to regional knowledge-based economies (2004) Blueprints For Foresight Actions in The Regions, p. 8. , European Commission, Brussels; Voros, J., A generic foresight process framework (2003) Foresight, 5 (3), pp. 10-21; Parrad, F., Goux Baudiment, F., Quand les villes pensent leur future (2001) Plus.

We have adopted a social practice perspective, which we base within an interpretative world view, to better understand how organisational foresight is enacted. This offers a reading of the phenomena, of which the essential contribution is that organisational foresight is more than an organisational property; it is something that reflective people do as they engage with various inputs from the outside and as a result of the continuous interaction between activity systems and their constituting elements. A longitudinal case study illustrates the importance of understanding the construction of collective and individual meaning in working with organisational foresight. The study shows how the inherent rigidity of the existing activity system and the weak ties between these diverse subsets of the organisation may block the interaction between emerging social practices and organisational intentions resulting in ongoing failures of understanding and enactment. A model is developed to include these parameters in an augmented activity systems model. Based on this we have identified the linking of organisational levels as one of the key dimensions to be considered for which the social practice perspective holds significant explanatory strength. © 2009.",,"future prospect; organizational framework; perception",,,,,"Stacey, R.D., (2003) Strategic Management and Organisational Dynamics, , Prentice Hall, Harlow, UK; Mintzberg, H., The fall and rise of strategic planning (1994) Harvard Business Review, pp. 107-114. , January-February; Balogun, J., Johnson, G., From intended strategies to unintended outcomes: the impact of change recipient sensemaking (2005) Organisation Studies, 26 (11), pp. 1573-1601; Weick, K.E., (2001) Making Sense of the Organization, , Blackwell Business; Smircich, L., Stubbart, C., Strategic management in an enacted world (1985) Academy of Management Review, 10 (4), pp. 724-736; Weick, K.E., (1995) Sensemaking in Organizations, p. 31. , Sage Publications, London; Van der Heijden, K., Can internally generated futures accelerate organizational learning?

Here, academia has identified corporate foresight and innovation as key success factors. While, content-wise, the contribution of futures research methods to the innovation process has already been researched, this study strives to explore the status quo of organizational development stages of both concepts. To do so, we developed a portfolio-approach, the so-called 'Future-Fitness-Portfolio', which enables companies to qualitatively compare amongst others and identify organizational improvement potential. In addition, we conducted expert interviews to explore future organizational development trends in corporate foresight and innovation management. As our research revealed, five strategic clusters can be identified within the portfolio. Consequently, we propose specific strategies for each individual cluster. We conclude that there will be two main organizational development trends for corporate foresight and innovation management in the future: in traditional industries with conventional business models and long product-life-cycles, companies will follow a different development path than companies in dynamic industries with innovative business models and short product-life-cycles. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"business development; competitiveness; corporate strategy; future prospect; industrial competition; industrial development; innovation; knowledge based system; organizational framework; planning method; technological development",,,,,"Spira, J.B., Step up to the knowledge economy (2006) KM World, 15 (8), pp. 1-30; Becker, W.M., Freeman, V.M., Going from global trends to corporate strategy (2006) The McKinsey Quarterly, (3), pp. 17-27; van Giessel, J.-F., Boekholt, P., (2005) Valorising the Innovation Capacity of the Firm, , European Commission, Brussels; Porter, M.E., Millar, V.E., How information gives you competitive advantage (1985) Harvard Business Review, 63 (4), pp. 149-160; Drucker, P.F., The next information revolution (1998) Forbes ASAP, pp. 1-9; Floridi, L., Is semantic information meaningful data?

The paper addresses this question in the context of Foresight in local governance. It describes a project aiming at creating visions for a Norwegian municipality by inviting schoolchildren to contribute with their ideas of the future. The focus is on how the interactions between project owners and participants produced certain forms of resistance and led to visions best described as idealistic conformism. Introducing the idea of 'reflexive futures', I suggest that that a broader understanding of reflexivity as containing both enabling and constraining features can help to unlock certain paradoxes of current Foresight and provide a renewed inquiry into the practise of visioning for strategy and long-term planning. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"forecasting method; governance approach; knowledge; local planning",,,,,"(2004) Managing the Future: Foresight in the Knowledge Economy, , Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK, H.

Churchman's concept of dialectical inquiry (DI) is presented, and some major derivatives of DI are reviewed, as well as an integrative method for sustainable insightful foresight developed by the authors called comprehensive situation mapping (CSM). In addition to its dialectical process side, CSM offers computational capabilities for devising and figuring out change scenarios. The theory for the manual application of CSM is summarized; in addition, its recent computerized version is presented and likely future improvements are sketched out in light of a current spate of case studies investigating the user-friendliness of its computerization. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"computer aided design; conceptual framework; design; organizational framework; philosophy; sustainable development; theoretical study",,,,,"Schein, E.H., (1969) Process Consultation: Its Role in Organization Development, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Ackoff, R.L., (1981) Creating the Corporate Future, , Wiley, New York; Churchman, C.W., (1968) The Systems Approach, , Dell, New York; Churchman, C.W., (1979) The Systems Approach and its Enemies, , Basic Books, New York; (1975) The Delphi Method, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, H.A.

We first argue that the entrepreneur exists in a much broader institutional context than current economic models of entrepreneurship consider. We then develop a definition of entrepreneurship as a special case of foresight-we argue that entrepreneurs are individuals who enact a unique vision of the future, and show how this view of entrepreneurial action leads to a new view of the basis of competitive advantage for startup firms. We then use this definition of entrepreneurship and the expanded view of institutional context to develop a model of entrepreneurial policies that takes the state of economic development and the unique historical context of the country into account. We close by discussing the implications of the model for policy makers and scenario planners in the domain of economic and institutional development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"economic development; economic policy; entrepreneur; future prospect; innovation; institutional development; policy making",,,,,"Phelps, E.S., Dynamic capitalism (2006) The Wall Street Journal, 14, pp. A14. , October; Schumpeter, J.A., (1934) The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest and the Business Cycle, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Bussey, M., The public clock: temporal ordering and policy (2007) Futures, 39, pp. 53-64; Wonglimpiyarat, J., National foresight in science and technology strategy development (2007) Futures, 39, pp. 718-728; Narayanan, V.K., Fahey, L., The relevance of the institutional underpinnings of porter's five forces framework to emerging economies: an epistemological analysis (2005) Journal of Management Studies, 42, pp. 207-223; Narayanan, V.K., Fahey, L., Institutional evolution as an emerging focus in scenario planning (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 972-992; Phelps, E.S., Entrepreneurial culture (2007) The Wall Street Journal, 12. , February; Dimaggio, P., Powell, W., The iron cage revisited: Institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields (1983) American Sociological Review, 48, pp. 147-160; Astley, W.G., The two ecologies: Population and community perspectives on organizational evolution (1985) Administrative Science Quarterly, 30, p. 224. , June; Chesbrough, H.W., Making sense of corporate venture capital (2002) Harvard Business Review, 80 (3), pp. 90-99; Sahlman, W.A., The structure and governance of venture-capital organizations (1990) Journal of Financial Economics, 27 (10), pp. 473-521; Scott, W., (1992) Organizations: Rational Natural and Open Systems, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Bourdieu, P., (1990) The Logic of Practice, , Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA; Tsoukas, H., The firm as a distributed knowledge system: a constructionist approach (1996) Strategic Management Journal, 17, pp. 11-25. , Winter (Special issue); Coleman, J.S., Social capital in the creation of human capital (1988) American Journal of Sociology, 94 (SUPPL.

Although trends are considered to be important drivers of environmental discontinuities which may lead to strategic surprises, there is no operationalization from a strategic point of view. In this paper we are going to conceptualize trends as (socio-cultural) innovations. This leads to important implications. If the nature of innovation is taken seriously, then strategic trend diagnosis has to deal with two different aspects, invention and diffusion. First, we are going to present a framework for identifying the invention aspect of a trend (i.e., "" the new"" ) which is based on the fact that "" the new"" results from a transgression of contextual boundaries. Second, we are going to operationalize the diffusion of "" the new"" as a threefold process of normalization - i.e., an unusual practice becomes social convention. Taken together, these two aspects provide a theoretical link between trends and market creation. In addition, by relating the above operationalizations to an entrepreneurial strategy-making framework, strategic issue diagnosis can be improved and more seamlessly linked to strategy formulation. © 2009.",,"conceptual framework; entrepreneur; future prospect; innovation; market development; organizational framework; planning theory; strategic approach; technology diffusion; theoretical study; trend analysis",,,,,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , The Macmillian Company, New York; Keegan, W.J., (1967), Scanning the International Business Environment, Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, Boston; Bright, J.R., Evaluating signals of technological change (1970) Harvard Business Review, 48, pp. 62-70; Bright, J.R., Forecasting by monitoring signals of technological change (1973) A Guide to Practical Technological Forecasting, pp. 238-256. , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, J.R.

Inverse vaccination, the opposite of Jenner's concept, for therapy of autoimmunity (foresight). J Intern Med 2010: 267: 441-451. DNA-based vaccines to induce antigen-specific inhibition of immune responses in human autoimmune diseases represent the inverse of what Jenner intended when he invented vaccination. Jenner's vaccine induced antigen-specific immunity to small pox. DNA vaccines for autoimmunity have been developed in preclinical settings, and now tested in human trials. The first two clinical trials, one in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, and the other in type 1 diabetes indicate that specific inhibition of antigen-specific antibody and T-cell responses is attainable in humans. Further development of this approach is ongoing. This new version of immunization termed 'inverse vaccination' when applied to autoimmune diseases, may allow targeted reduction of unwanted antibody and T-cell responses to autoantigens, while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact. The method of specifically reducing a pathological adaptive autoimmune response is termed inverse vaccination. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Autoimmunity; Diabetes mellitus; Jenner; Multiple sclerosis;

Social constructionists and organizational theorists have indicated that the future of an organization can be enacted by its constituents. Yet it is apparent that scenario planning techniques, used by organizations to plan for their future, tend to emphasize a future that the organization must react to instead of create. By emphasizing a future that the organizations must react to, it may ignore and completely miss the opportunity it has to create or enact the future it wants to have.Scenario planning, however, can evolve to support a creative foresight and approach to the future by recognizing the power behind enactment theory and applying a goal-oriented approach to the scenario planning process. Using goal-oriented scenario planning an organization can match the world it wants with the world it expects to see. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"corporate strategy; planning method; social construction",,,,,"Brand, S., (1999) The Clock of the Long Now, , Basic Books, New York; Chermack, T.J., Lynham, S.A., Ruona, W.E.A., A review of scenario planning literature (2001) Futures Research Quarterly, pp. 7-31. , Summer; Mietzner, D., Reger, G., Advantages and disadvantages of scenario approaches for strategic foresight (2005) International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning, 1 (2), pp. 220-239; Mankins, M.C., Steele, R., Stop making plans, start making decisions (2006) Harvard Business Review, pp. 76-84. , January; Schoemaker, P.J.H., Scenario planning, a tool for strategic thinking (1995) MIT Sloan Management Review, pp. 25-40. , Winter; Weick, K., (1979) The Social Psychology of Organizing, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Mir, R., Watson, A., Strategic management and the philosophy of science: the case for a constructivist methodology, Strategic Management Journal 21 (2000), pp. 941-953; Raimond, P., Two styles of foresight: are we predicting the future or inventing it?

Indeed, planning, considering, and studying can be important precursors to decision-making, and often seem essential for effective action. This view of premeditation is shared by most humans, a kind of universal ideal, and it carries an additional interesting implication: Even the hint that premeditation occurred can serve as a potent cue indicating voluntary action, both to actors and observers. In legal and moral contexts, for example, actors are seen as especially culpable for the consequences of their actions if those consequences were premeditated, whether or not the premeditation influenced the decision. In this chapter, we review evidence indicating that even irrelevant premeditation can lead people to believe that an action's consequences were under personal control. We present research exploring how various forms of premeditation-including foresight, effortful forethought, wishful thinking, and the consideration of multiple possible outcomes of action-may lead actors to prefer and to feel responsible for action outcomes even when this premeditation has no causal relation to the outcomes. © 2010 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

One possible way of reducing these redispatch costs is to introduce demand response in the form of real-time pricing (RTP), which could allow electricity demand to respond to actual real-time wind resource availability using price signals. A day-ahead unit commitment model with day-ahead wind forecasts and a real-time dispatch model with actual wind resource availability is used to estimate system operations in a high wind penetration scenario. System operations are compared to a perfect foresight benchmark, in which actual wind resource availability is known day-ahead. The results show that wind integration costs with fixed demands can be high, both due to real-time redispatch costs and lost load. It is demonstrated that introducing RTP can reduce redispatch costs and eliminate loss of load events. Finally, social surplus with wind generation and RTP is compared to a system with neither and the results demonstrate that introducing wind and RTP into a market can result in superadditive surplus gains. © 2010 IEEE.","Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Wind forecast errors; Wind power generation","Power system economics; Real time pricing; Unit commitments; Wind forecast errors; Wind forecasts; Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Errors; Integration; Internet protocols; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Electric load forecasting",,,,,"Fabbri, A., Román, T.G.S., Abbad, J.R., Quezada, V.H.M., Assessment of the cost associated with wind generation prediction errors in a liberalized electricity market (2005) IEEE Trans.

Marketers are asked to develop scenarios about emerging technologies such as broadband wireless but more often than not have no education or training in scenario planning. Also marketers are often stuck in a strategic planning mindset based on successful replication of past marketing strategies. Strategic management and marketing learning has ventured into futures and foresight methodologies, but with strong focus on conventional macroscopic high-level scenario planning methods.This paper positions scenario planning as a method to express the future vision, both tacit and explicit, of business, products and services in a clear succinct story form, to underpin all elements of a marketing strategy (goals, position and execution). The scenario planning for marketing action (SPMA) model is introduced and discussed incorporating eight principles: moderation and time compression; storytelling led new product and service development; customer orientation; iterative dynamic scenarios; complexity science to foster non-linear thinking; risk weighted scenarios; participant hosted scenario workshops; springboard consolidation.The SPMA method was proven and evolved within postgraduate Executive education courses in Sydney and Bangkok from 2003 to 2007. This approach is fundamental for marketers to gain competences in "" learning the future faster"" , thus possessing capabilities to imagine and invent the future and deliver the future earlier. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"business development; future prospect; marketing; planning method; strategic approach",,,,,"Friedman, T.L., Conclusion: imagination (2006) The World is Flat: The Globalized World in the Twenty-First Century (Newly Revised and Expanded), , Penguin Books, Camberwell, Australia, Chapter 15; Hendrix, P., Mobility - the next disruptive technology, Presentation at the AMA Faculty Consortium on Electronic Commerce, Texas A&M University, 16 July 2001; Freidman, ibid; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage, , Free Press, New York; Schwarz, P., (1991) The Art of the Long View: Planning for the Future in an Uncertain World, , Currency Doubleday, New York; Shoemaker, P.J.H., (1995), pp. 25-40. , Scenario Planning: A Tool for Strategic Thinking, Sloan Management Review, Winter; Van Buren, D.C., Brannigan Smith, D., Scenario planning: a new approach to teaching marketing strategy (1999) Journal of Marketing Education, 21 (2), pp. 146-155; Iansiti, M., MacCormack, A., (1996), Living On Internet Time: Product Development at Netscape, Yahoo!, Net Dynamics and Microsoft, Harvard Business School, Boston, 9-697-052; Tulving, E., Chronesthesia: conscious awareness of subjective time (2002) Principles of Frontal Lobe Function, , Oxford University Press, D.T.

Taking over to a pro-active role in the innovation management is a fundamental step to achieve the strategic goals and it must be faced as a necessary condition for the formation of a favorable environment to disseminate knowledge to the Brazilian industrial sector. This work is based on two approaches: the technological innovation is a cumulative process - which is established by means of the interaction among government, enterprises and R&D institutions, besides the market - and the technological foresight approach, in which the strategic management of the technological innovation implies negotiating demands and promising investigation fields, besides influencing on conditions of the environment in which the actors are inserted, promoting a macro-coordination. This paper presents considerations about the Brazilian aerospace industry and about the technological innovation context at the Defense Ministry and at the Aeronautic Command, specifically at DCTA.

In this study, we investigated whether hindsight bias affected judgements about the legitimacy of lethal force decisions in police shooting incidents for counter-terrorism operations. We also assessed to what extent this hindsight bias was mediated by factors such as role and information quality. Four hundred and eighty participants completed a short questionnaire that manipulated role (as senior police officer, Independent Police Complaints Commissioner, or family member, plus a ""no role"" control group), information quality (detailed/good or vague/ambiguous), and outcome knowledge (knowledge of outcome/hindsight versus no knowledge of outcome/foresight) in a 4 × 2 × 2design. Results indicated that outcome knowledge affected the perception of threat and decision quality but not the blameworthiness of the senior police officer. Quality of information had a significant effect on all three dependent variables and role had a significant impact on judgements as to whether the decision to shoot was correct and also the perceived threat, though not on perceived blameworthiness. These findings indicate that people who have to judge the liability of lethal force decisions are not able to ignore outcome information, and are strongly influenced by the quality of information and by the role in which they are receiving the information.

Decompressive craniectomy has defined this era of damage-control wartime neurosurgery. Injuries that in previous conflicts were treated in an expectant manner are now aggressively decompressed at the far-forward Combat Support Hospital and transferred to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) and National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) in Bethesda for definitive care. The purpose of this paper is to examine the baseline characteristics of those injured warriors who received decompressive craniectomies. The importance of this procedure will be emphasized and guidance provided to current and future neurosurgeons deployed in theater. Methods. The authors retrospectively searched a database for all soldiers injured in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom between April 2003 and October 2008 at WRAMC and NNMC. Criteria for inclusion in this study included either a closed or penetrating head injury suffered during combat operations in either Iraq or Afghanistan with subsequent neurosurgical evaluation at NNMC or WRAMC. Exclusion criteria included all cases in which primary demographic data could not be verified. Primary outcome data included the type and mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and injury severity score (ISS) at admission, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge, 6 months, and 1-2 years. Results. Four hundred eight patients presented with head injury during the study period. In this population, a total of 188 decompressive craniectomies were performed (154 for penetrating head injury, 22 for closed head injury, and 12 for unknown injury mechanism). Patients who underwent decompressive craniectomies in the combat theater had significantly lower initial GCS scores (7.7± 4.2 vs 10.8± 4.0, p< 0.05) and higher ISSs (32.5± 9.4 vs 26.8± 11.8, p< 0.05) than those who did not. When comparing the GOS scores at hospital discharge, 6 months, and 1-2 years after discharge, those receiving decompressive craniectomies had significantly lower scores (3.0± 0.9 vs 3.7± 0.9, 3.5± 1.2 vs 4.0± 1.0, and 3.7 ± 1.2 vs 4.4± 0.9, respectively) than those who did not undergo decompressive craniectomies. That said, intragroup analysis indicated consistent improvement for those with craniectomy with time, allowing them, on average, to participate in and improve from rehabilitation (p< 0.05). Overall, 83% of those for whom follow-up data are available achieved a 1-year GOS score of greater than 3. Conclusions. This study of the provision of early decompressive craniectomy in a military population that sustained severe penetrating and closed head injuries represents one of the largest to date in both the civilian and military literature. The findings suggest that patients who undergo decompressive craniectomy had worse injuries than those receiving craniotomy and, while not achieving the same outcomes as those with a lesser injury, did improve with time. The authors recommend hemicraniectomy for damage control to protect patients from the effects of brain swelling during the long overseas transport to their definitive care, and it should be conducted with foresight concerning future complications and reconstructive surgical procedures.","Blast injury; Decompressive craniectomy; Glasgow outcome scale; Penetrating head injury","adult; Afghanistan; article; comparative study; decompressive craniectomy; female; general surgery; Glasgow coma scale; head injury; human; male; methodology; military medicine; neurosurgery; plastic surgery; postoperative complication; public hospital; statistics; treatment outcome; war; Adult; Afghan Campaign 2001-; Afghanistan; Decompressive Craniectomy; Female; General Surgery; Glasgow Coma Scale; Head Injuries, Closed; Head Injuries, Penetrating; Hospitals, Military; Humans; Iraq War, 2003 -; Male; Military Medicine; Neurosurgical Procedures; Postoperative Complications; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome; War",,,,,"Aarabi, B., Hesdorffer, D.C., Ahn, E.S., Aresco, C., Scalea, T.M., Eisenberg, H.M., Outcome following decompressive craniectomy for malignant swelling due to severe head injury (2006) J Neurosurg, 104, pp. 469-479; Aarabi, B., Taghipour, M., Alibaii, E., Kamgarpour, A., Central nervous system infections after military missile head wounds (1998) Neurosurgery, 42, pp. 500-509; Aldrich, E.F., Eisenberg, H.M., Saydjari, C., Foulkes, M.A., Jane, J.A., Marshall, L.F., Predictors of mortality in severely head-injured patients with civilian gunshot wounds: a report from the NIH Traumatic Coma Data Bank (1992) Surg Neurol, 38, pp. 418-423; Armonda, R.A., Bell, R.S., Vo, A.H., Ling, G., DeGraba, T.J., Crandall, B., Wartime traumatic cerebral vasospasm: recent review of combat casualties (2006) Neurosurgery, 59, pp. 1215-1225; Bell, R.S., Vo, A.H., Neal, C.J., Tigno, J., Roberts, R., Mossop, C., Military traumatic brain and spinal column injury: a 5-year study of the impact blast and other military grade weaponry on the central nervous system (2009) J Trauma, 66 (4 SUPPL.), pp. S104-S111; Bell, R.S., Vo, A.H., Roberts, R., Wanebo, J., Armonda, R.A., Wartime traumatic aneurysms: acute presentation, diagnosis, and multimodal treatment of 64 craniocervical arterial injuries (2010) Neurosurgery, 66, pp. 66-79; Bellamy, R.F., The causes of death in conventional land warfare: implications for combat casualty care research (1984) Mil Med, 149, pp. 55-62; Brandvold, B., Levi, L., Feinsod, M., George, E.D., Penetrating craniocerebral injuries in the Israeli involvement in the Lebanese conflict 1982-1985.

The purpose of the study is to discuss the existing practice, position the IDEAS and SAGES methods, and outline their contribution to the state of the art. Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the form of a literature study and conceptual discussion, illustrated with a case example of electronically mediated scenario methods. Findings: Both of the presented scenario methods, i.e. IDEAS and SAGES, are feasible means to compose scenarios. The methods can be positioned respectively to intuitive-logical and heuristic schools of thought. The contribution to existing practice is that they consume fewer resources than do their more traditional counterparts. Research limitations/implications: The empirical validation of the presented methods is presently limited to case studies. Thus, the authors invite practitioners and researchers to examine the methods and to discuss the applicability of the results. Practical implications: The IDEAS and SAGES methods offer tools for practicing managers to conduct scenario planning with practitioners and experts in a flexible and effective manner. Originality/value: The paper adds to the ongoing discussion on business and technology foresight by presenting the novel scenario methods, and positioning them explicitly to the existing practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Conferencing; Forecasting; Group decision support systems; Organizational planning; Project planning",,,,,,"Bell, W., (1997) Foundations of Futures Studies, 1-2. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ; Bergman, J.-P., Supporting knowledge creation and sharing in the early phases of the strategic innovation process (2005) Acta Universitatis Lappeenrantaesis, p. 212. , Lappeenranta University of Technology; Blanning, R.W., Reinig, B.A., A framework for conducting political event analysis using group support systems (2005) Decision Support Systems, 38, pp. 511-527; Börjeson, L., Höjer, M., Dreborg, K.-H., Ekvall, T., Finnveden, G., Scenario types and techniques: Towards a user's guide (2006) Futures, 38, pp. 723-739; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., van der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37, pp. 795-812; Chermack, T.J., Improving decision-making with scenario planning (2004) Futures, 36, pp. 295-309; Chermack, T.J.L., van der Merwe, L., The role of constructivist learning in scenario planning (2003) Futures, 35, pp. 445-460; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152; Courtney, H., Decision-driven scenarios for assessing four levels of uncertainty (2003) Strategy & Leadership, 31 (1), pp. 14-22; Forrester, J.W., From the ranch to system dynamics: An autobiography (1992) Management Laureates: A Collection of Autobiographical Essays, 1. , Bedeian, A.G.

This work systematically reviews three participative foresight cases based on three preconditions of consensus building, and attempts to draw some implications based on the comparison of these cases. This work conducts an analysis based on three dimensions of consensus building, including definition of problem, structure of negotiation, and motivation to participate, using three national foresights, including UK technology foresight in 1994-1998, Swedish foresight in 1998-2000, and German FUTUR in 2001-2004. The analysis reveals some significant factors of consensus building in participative foresight.

Rationale underlines foresight and suggests that targeting on a national goal, foresight as a knowledge network system is similar to the coordinating mechanism as any decision supporting system. This paper argues that the way of knowledge organised and the relevant policy formulated be more closely related to the structure of decision support network of a nation. The transaction-cost explanation helps reshape the organisation of foresight institutions in their role and rights structure.

Evolution is noted from an exercise aiming to set priorities and build networks as a broad instrument of science and innovation policy to a set of science-based discrete projects reaching across government.

In the exercise, the prospect of future Korean society up to the year 2030 was developed. The exercise was designed to widen the participation of the stakeholder and to enhance the link to policy measures. Future and present needs were deduced through surveys on the general public that were refined through expert panels. Then, the committee for each technology sector was set-up to develop the future technological subjects. They were Delphi-surveyed. The scenarios for the future social system were drafted for envisaging the implication of uncertain developments and for examining the scope for possible action plan.

We show a method for calculating a Degree of Conflict using FURPS+ model. The NeXT model comes in compliance with the characteristics of the current society in which the link between technology and society is stronger than ever before.

Disciplines and discourses do not emerge from a vacuum but have a history and a cultural context; and their names can hide as much as they reveal. This paper examines such terms as 'futurology' and 'foresight', and argues that to emphasise plurality and diversity the study of the future is best served by the moniker 'futures studies'. It suggests that remembering the history of futures discourse is necessary to resolve the crisis of identity and meaning, and frequent fruitless reinvention, of the field. Finally, it presents Sardar's four laws of futures studies: futures studies are wicked (they deal largely with complex, interconnected problems), MAD (emphasise Mutually Assured Diversity), sceptical (question dominant axioms and assumptions) and futureless (bear fruit largely in the present). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"future prospect; nomenclature; terminology",,,,,"Lahiri, J., (2003) The Namesake, , HarperPerennial, London; Slaughter, R.A., (1995) The Foresight Principle, , Adamantine Press, London; mailto:WFSF-L@list1.ucc.nau.edu; Flechtheim, O.K., (1966) History and Futurology, , Verlag Anton Hein, Meisenheim am Glan; Masini, E., (2008), mailto:WFSF-L@list1.ucc.nau.edu, post dated 27 May; Malaska, P., (2008), mailto:WFSF-L@list1.ucc.nau.edu, post dated 22 May; Dator, J., (1996), 3. , 'Foreword', in: R.A.

Future orientation is a way human thinking is manifested, where thoughts are filled with preconceptions, imagination and expectations. Our research has shown that the following component parts characterise future orientation: thinking about the future, applying regular social techniques to limit its uncertainty, actions taken in the interest of the future, and expectations concerning the future. Based on these component parts the future orientation of Hungarian society was studied empirically in 1995 and in 2006.

The continuing capacity issue in higher education, opportunities provided with technological developments, changes in learning needs and understanding of learning are some reasons. However, faculty, staff and administration in distance education systems may not have sufficient background in the distance education field. There is a need for professionals who have theoretical knowledge and/or practical skills in the field and also foresight into the future and make necessary changes in current systems. It is necessary to gain effective and high quality results. Certificate and/or graduate programs in the distance education field can provide opportunities to train experts. The participants in these programs can be candidates who are planning to work or the faculty/staff already working in this kind of system. Structuring such a program is then an important issue to be considered. Stakeholders' perspectives and expectations should be examined and evaluated. Academic staff who have been working in this field and learners are two of the groups that can be consulted. The aim of this chapter, therefore, is to discuss and analyze the scope, management, characteristics and implementation dimensions of distance education from the point of the people involved in distance education activities. This chapter addresses a qualitative study in which interviews were done with the two groups respectively. Suggestions were presented based on the findings. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The case concerns Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) and took place from January to May, 2009. Design/methodology/approach – Both foresight and organizational learning methods are combined in the process. During workshops, researchers and management are enabled to cocreate interdisciplinary service research proposals and a service research strategy for VTT. The workshops are designed to facilitate a dialogue between users of the research and potential collaborators (universities, funding agencies and societal actors). This initiative reflects the current global service science discourse based on a renewal of service management through servicedominant logic and network thinking. Findings – Although the need for cocreation across disciplines and together with the customer has often been stated in service research, methods enabling such a way of acting have rarely been tested and achieved. This method worked as a concrete way for managing futureoriented networking across organizational borders as a basis for continuous learning and innovation. Research limitations/implications – The new approach to service science and the methods used in the VTT network are applicable in research practice. Practical implications – The development process presented in this paper is an embryo for a new kind of research culture that fosters learning in networks as well as the shared and transparent planning of project proposals. Originality/value – By creating the service science and business network and a process of learning by foresighting and evaluating our ideas on a concrete case are applied. This is believed to be the first time that methods of foresight and organizational learning have been combined. Furthermore, the process builds a research strategy both from below and above and together with customers and other collaborators thus establishing a network of cocreation. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer service management; Finland; Learning methods; Networking; Research work; Strategic evaluation",,,,,,"Ahlqvist, T., Bäck, A., Halonen, M., Heinonen, S., (2008) Social Media Roadmaps: Exploring the Futures Triggered by Social Media, p. 78. , VTT Tiedotteita – Research Notes: 2454, VTT, Espoo, + app. 1; Barile, S., Polese, F., Linking the viable system and many-to-many network approaches to service-dominant logic and service science (2010) International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, 2 (1); Coyne, K., Gorman Clifford, P., Dye, R., Breakthrough thinking from inside the box (2007) Harvard Business Review, (December), pp. 71-78; Engeström, Y., (1987) Learning by Expanding: An Activity Theoretical Approach to Developmental Research, , Orienta-konsultit, Jyväskylä; Engeström, Y., Expansive visibilization of work: an activity – theoretical perspective (1999) Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 8 (1-2), pp. 63-93; Engeström, Y., Expansive learning at work: toward an activity theoretical reconceptualization (2001) Journal of Education and Work, 14 (1), pp. 133-156; Engeström, Y., Virkkunen, J., Helle, M., Pihlaja, J., Poikela, R., The change laboratory as a tool for transforming work (1996) Lifelong Learning in Europe, 2, pp. 10-17; Fetterman, D., The transformation of evaluation into a collaboration: a vision of evaluation in the 21st century (2001) American Journal of Evaluation, 22 (3), pp. 381-385; Friedman, V.J., Designed blindness: an action science perspective on program theory evaluation (2001) American Journal of Evaluation, 22 (2), pp. 161-181; Gherardini, S., Nicolini, D., Odella, F., Toward a social understanding of how people learn in organizations: the notion of situated curriculum (1998) Management Learning, 29 (3), pp. 273-297; Gummesson, E., Quality, service-dominant logic and many-to-many marketing (2008) The TQM Journal, 20 (2), pp. 143-153; Koivisto, R., Wessberg, N., Eerola, A., Ahlqvist, T., Kivisaari, S., Myllyoja, J., Halonen, M., Integrating future-oriented technology analysis and risk assessment methodologies (2009) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 76, pp. 1163-1176; Kosonen, M., Sähköiset palvelut – Suomen kilpailukyvyn uusi veturi?

It was made use of the existing space in an optimum way. All objectives that were pursued with the reconstruction were successfully realized by the mechanical engineers. The challenges in terms of logistics during the reconstruction process were systematically mastered, which might certainly be due to the good collaboration of all parties involved. So far, Gilne Treppen realized a proportion of 15% SCC. However, they expect a substantial increase of this proportion in the medium term. With the factory layout, the production technology installed and the essential foresight to recognize and integrate still necessary further reconstructions in future, the concrete factory is well positioned in the second generation too. ""With these investments made we are very well prepared for the future,"" state the two managing directors, Gilhaus and Neyer, ""furthermore, we have a lot of options considering the capacities for expansion."" After 2009, which was supposed to be a difficult year, had successfully been completed, the company is looking ahead to the year to come with optimism and burning for action. Besides the national market the management is still aiming at increasing international sales. The company would like to make full use of the second factory building soon and thus, utilize the production capacity completely. The reconstruction period was certainly a difficult and exhausting time and hard in terms of logistics, but it was worth the trouble for all those involved. Now, due to the optimization it is possible to manufacture staircases even more cost-effective.

This paper explores how, using networks of experts, TF capabilities can be built. On the basis of three case studies and 43 interviews, it is shown that building foresight systems through networks of scouts yields several benefits, including the support for sourcing external technologies. Using insights from the three major telecommunication incumbents in Europe, the paper describes and discusses (1) what can be achieved by technology scouting, (2) how a process can be set up, (3) what is important in the design of a scouting network, and (4) the characteristics that should be aimed for when choosing technology scouts. The paper contributes to the methodological base of corporate foresight, to the technology management literature, and to the understanding of how companies can increase their open-innovation capabilities by extending the intertwinement with their environment. © 2010 The Authors.

Foresight in medicine: current challenges with Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines (Foresight). J Intern Med 2010; 267: 241-250. Abstract. An effective vaccine to prevent invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria has been available for more than 20 years. Hib conjugate vaccine is safe, efficacious and easy to use, and its cost-benefit ratio is high both in industrialized as well as in developing countries. In spite of this, WHO estimates that every year approximately 8 million children contract life-threatening Haemophilus infections, especially meningitis or severe pneumonia. If we want to take seriously the Millenium Development Goal of reducing the mortality of under 5-year-old children by two-thirds before the year 2015, an effective means to contribute to this would be more efficient use of Hib vaccines [1]. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Hib infections;

Clinical handover is complex, cognitively taxing and clinical risks are linked to lack of clarity. The research is clear that there is room to improve and that it is a risky time for patients. What is unclear is what varied anticipatory techniques healthcare practitioners already use to develop their intuition and foresight so that they can prospectively manage and cope with ambiguity and uncertainty, and how they use their discretionary space in practice. Both reliability and resilience principles are important to develop effective CoSR. Handoff strategies from higher reliability (HR) industries indicate that the three most important features of effective handovers are; • Two way face-to-face communication, • written support tools and • Content in handover which captures intention. These recommendations align with the recommendations of most healthcare handover research in the last 15 years While there is ample research describing the problem of handover in patient safety, much of the research is of poor quality and proposes simplistic normative solutions such as 'SBAR'. While standardization and minimum data sets may have their place, we still need to learn how clinicians create; foresight, coping strategies and recovery strategies so that they can better manage efficiency and thoroughness tradeoffs (ETTO). Resilience Engineering (RE) principles will help us establish and better describe these prospective, adaptive and predictive capacities. Future research should evaluate; first - what techniques clinicians already use to create foresight during CoSR and, second- Whether patient safety (preventable adverse events) is associated with the degree of prospective / anticipatory communication in the preceding CoSR.",,"ambiguity; anticipation; clinical practice; clinical shift handover; health personnel attitude; intensive care unit; interpersonal communication; intuition; medical profession; reliability; respiratory therapist; review; standardization",,,,,"(2008) Omentum Accreditation Program, Required Organizational Practice; Patient Safety - Communication, , http://www.accreditation.ca/uploadedFiles/information%20transfer.pdf?n= 1212, © Accreditation Canada 05/29/2008; (2005) Clinical Handover and Patient Safety - Literature Review Report, , http://www.health.gov.au/internet/safety/publishing.nsf/Content/ AA1369AD4AC5FC2ACA2571BF0081CD95/$File/clinhovrlitrev.pdf, ASQC Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Healthcare downloaded June 20.2009 from; (2008) The Evidenced-based Literature Review Prepared by EHealth Services Research Group for the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC), , http://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/internet/safety/publishing.nsf/ Content/E0B59E130FA90A50CA2573AF007BC3C8/$File/CHoverLitReview.pdf, ACSQHC Downloaded August 10, 2009 from; Amalberti, R., Auroy, Y., Barach, P., Berwick, D., Five system barriers to achieving ultra safe healthcare (2005) Annals of Internal Medicine, 142, pp. 756-765; Anderson, R.A., Crabtree, B.F., McDaniel, R.R., Steele, D.J., (2005) Case Study Research: The View from Complexity Science Qualitative Health Research, 15 (5), pp. 669-685; Baker, S.J., (2009) Excellence in the Emergency Department, How to Get Results, , Gulf Breeze, Florida: Studer Group, Fire Starter publishing; Baker, R.G., Blais, R., Brown, A., Cox, J., Flintoft, V., Norton, P.G., The Canadian Adverse Events Study: The incidence of adverse events among hospital patients in Canada (2004) Canadian Medical Association Journal May 25, 170 (11); Dekker, S.W.A., (2006) The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error, , Hampshire, England.

We argue that social influences can produce two observable effects: (1) discontinuities in unconditional adoption curves and (2) pattern reversals in conditional adoption curves, in which earlier adoption is found for one group of actors versus another when fundamentals suggest the reverse ordering should occur; in turn the presence of either of these features can, under weak assumptions, be interpreted as evidence of social influences. As such, these properties are robust implications of social effects. © 2010 by the European Economic Association.",,,,,,,"Adsera, A., Ray, D., History and Coordination Failure (1998) Journal of Economic Growth, 3, pp. 267-276; Ait-Sahalia, Y., Disentangling Diffusion from Jumps (2004) Journal of Financial Economics, 74, pp. 487-528; Ait-Sahalia, Y., Jacod, J., Testing for Jumps in a Discretely Observed Process (2009) Annals of Statistics, 37, pp. 184-222; Aradillas-Lopez, A., (2007) Semiparametric Efficiency In Models With Rational Expec- Tations and Strategic Interactions, , Working paper, Princeton University; Bandiera, O., Rasul, I., Social Networks and Technology Adoption in Northern Mozambique (2006) Economic Journal, 116, pp. 869-092; Barndoff-Neilson, O., Shephard, N., Econometrics of Testing for Jumps in Financial Economics Using Bipolar Variation (2006) Journal of Financial Econometrics, 4, pp. 1-30; Barrett, G., Donald, S., Consistent Tests for Stochastic Dominance (2003) Econometrica, 71, pp. 71-104; Brock, W., (2001) Complexity-based Methods In Cycles and Growth, , Any Potential Value-Added?

The article specifically examines how PPPs manage and mitigate risks arising from market, institutional and systemic weaknesses that often hinder pro-poor innovation in developing-country agriculture. Data are drawn from a survey of 75 projects undertaken by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and its private sector partners. Findings indicate that while PPPs are improving how the international system manages its research agenda, they are fraught with risks for both public and private sector partners. Precautionary, legal, and financial strategies to manage risk are needed, as are effective communications strategies, platform-building strategies, and foresight into worst-case scenarios. However, evidence suggests that such strategies are not commonly used or available to the international research community and its partners, especially in the field of biotechnology research. © 2010, RIS.","Agricultural research and development; Biotechnology; Innovation incentives; Public-private partnership; Risk management",,,,,,"Ayele, S., Chataway, J., Wield, D., Partnerships in African Crop Biotech (2006) Nature Biotechnology, 24 (6), pp. 619-621; Beintema, N.M., Stads, G., (2006) Agricultural R&D In Sub-Saharan Africa: An Era of Stagnation, , Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute; Bezanson, K., Narain, S., Prante, G., (2004) Independent Evaluation of The Partnership Committees of The CGIAR: Final Report, , Washington, D.C.: CGIAR; Binenbaum, E., (2006) Qualitative Analysis of R&D Consortia, , Mimeo; Binenbaum, E., Pardey, P.G., Wright, B.D., Public-private Research Relationships: The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (2001) American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 83 (3), pp. 748-753; Byerlee, D., The Search for a New Pparadigm for the Development of National Agricultural Research Systems (1998) World Development, 26 (6), pp. 1049-1055; Byerlee, D., Fischer, K., Accessing Modern Science: Policy and Institutional Options for Agricultural Biotechnology in Developing Countries (2002) World Development, 30 (6), pp. 931-948; Buse, K., Walt, G., Global Public-private Partnerships: Part I-A New Development in Health?

The Ken Wilber inspired integral futures, developed by Richard Slaughter and others, and put forth as the most comprehensive approach to-date, is critiqued and assessed. While Wilber's integral and the variant it has inspired in futures represent significant innovations, it also contains the tendency to un-necessarily close down, lock out or to sub-ordinate alternative conceptions of holism, what I term 'Wilber-ism'. Wilber's 'theory of everything' and integral futures are analysed, re-assessed and re-situated in the context of the alternative approaches to holism that exist. What emerges is a rich view of potential genealogies and ontogenies as movements toward holism. One variant from the action research tradition, which I call 'integrative foresight', is put forward as an example of an alternative. The article concludes by proposing a process of dynamic dialogue between diverse conceptions of holism, which can at once honour the great diversity of approaches, while likewise continuing the journey of creating shared meaning and common understandings of the complex contexts in which futures inquiry works. © 2009.",,"conceptual framework; future prospect; holistic approach; prediction",,,,,"Gidley, J., The evolution of consciousness as a planetary imperative: an integration of integral views (2007) Integral Review, 5; Slaughter, R., (2004) Futures Beyond Dystopia: Creating Social Foresight, , Routledge Falmer, London; Slaughter, R., A new framework for environmental scanning (1999) Foresight, 1 (6); Wilber, K., (2000) Integral Psychology: Consciousness, Spirit, Psychology, Therapy, , Shambhala, Boston; Wilber, K., (2000) A Theory of Everything: An Integral Vision for Business, Politics, Science, and Spirituality, , Shambhala, Boston; Latour, B., (2005) Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor Network Theory, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bourdieu, P., (1998) Practical Reason: On the Theory of Action, , Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA; Hampson, G., Integral re-views postmodernism: the way out is through (2007) Integral Review, 4, pp. 108-173; Tertulian, N., Lukaks, Adorno and classical German philosophy (1985) Telos, 63, p. 91; Slaughter, R., What difference does 'integral' make?

The 3D-CLP is the problem of loading a subset of a given set of rectangular boxes into a rectangular container so that the packing volume is maximized. The method includes two variants: the full-support variant guarantees full support from below for all packed boxes, although this constraint is not taken into account by the nonsupport variant. The guillotine cut constraint is considered by both variants. The method is mainly based on two concepts. On the one hand, the block building approach is generalized. Not only are blocks of identical boxes in the same spatial orientation applied but also blocks of different boxes with small inner gaps. On the other hand, the tree search is carried out in a special fashion called a partition-controlled tree search. This makes the search both efficient and diverse, enabling a sufficient search width as well as a suitable degree of foresight. The approach achieves excellent results for the well-known 3D-CLP instances suggested by Bischoff and Ratcliff [Bischoff, E. E., M. S. W. Ratcliff. 1995.

Numerous water resources system models have been developed to evaluate these resources, yet often fail to adequately address critical aspects, including the transient (e.g., filling) stages of reservoirs, relevant streamflow retention policies and downstream consequences, construction staggering, and the implications of stochastic modeling of variable climate and climate change. This omission has clear economic impacts on benefits and costs and could be pivotal in national policy and decision making. The Investment Model for Planning Ethiopian Nile Development dynamic water resources system model is outlined and applied to address these aspects. For the hydropower and irrigation development projects specified, model results disregarding transient and construction stagger aspects demonstrate overestimations of $6 billion in benefits and 170% in downstream flows compared to model results accounting for these aspects. Benefit-cost ratios for models accounting for transient conditions and climate variability are found to range from 1.2-1.8 under historical climate regimes for the streamflow retention policies evaluated. Climate change scenarios, represented either by changes in the frequency of El Niño and La Niña events or by the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios projections, indicate potential for small benefit-cost increases, but also reflect the potential for noteworthy decreases, relative to the historical climate conditions. In particular, stochastic modeling of scenarios representing a doubling of the historical frequency of El Niño events indicates benefit-cost ratios as low as 1.0, even under perfect foresight optimization modeling, due to a lack of timely water. However, even at this ratio, Ethiopia, at current growth rates, may still be unable to absorb all the potential energy developed, reinforcing the need for significant economic planning and the necessity of securing energy trade contracts prior to extensive expansion. © 2010 ASCE.","Climatic changes; Economic development; Ethiopia; Stochastic models; Transient response; Water management; Water resources","Benefit cost ratios; Benefits and costs; Blue Nile; Climate change scenarios; Climate condition; Climate regime; Climate variability; Climatic changes; Cost-increases; Development dynamics; Downstream flow; Economic development; Economic impacts; Economic planning; Ethiopia; Hydro-power development; Investment models; Irrigation development; Model results; National policies; Optimization modeling; River basin development; Special report on emissions scenarios; Stochastic modeling; Transient conditions; Transient response; Water resources systems; Climate models; Cost accounting; Costs; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Irrigation; Model structures; Nickel compounds; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Stream flow; Transient analysis; Water management; Climate change; climate change; climate variation; cost-benefit analysis; economic development; economic impact; hydroelectric power; irrigation; river basin; stochasticity; water management; water resource; Blue Nile Basin; Ethiopia; Nile Basin",,,,,"Arsano, Y., Tamrat, I., Ethiopia and the eastern Nile Basin (2005) Aquat.

Design/methodology/approach: Through evaluation, literature search, and personal experiences, five approaches were identified where health foresight has shown strong value: forecasting, scenario planning, Delphi, technology roadmapping, and mass collaboration. For each approach, compelling examples are given, and usage and potential discussed. Findings: There is great opportunity to learn from and expand on past successes, and to customize foresight methods to help decision making in medicine and global health. The range of novel applications to date provides clear evidence that applying foresight methods to health can help prepare for the future, including development of policy and health interventions. Research limitations/implications: Metrics for the impact of health foresight are not widely used, and could be a focus of future research. Practical implications: By seeing compelling examples of diverse foresight methods in medicine and global health, readers will be better equipped to improve health systems and interventions, and prepare for future public health incidents. Originality/value: The paper brings together discussion of a range of health foresight success stories, and suggests potential customizations of foresight for the health field. Readers who are health professionals or involved in making policy for health systems will gain a toolbox for creative planning. Readers who are foresight professionals will gain a better understanding of which foresight methods have shown value in medicine and global health, and potential refinement of foresight techniques for health applications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Delphi method; Forecasting; Health and medicine",,,,,,"(2008) Roadmapping Converging Technologies to Combat Emerging Infectious Diseases, , APEC Center for Technology Foresight, National Science and Technology Development Agency, APEC Center for Technology Foresight, Bangkok; Armstrong, J.S., (2001) Principles of Forecasting, , Kluwer Academic, Boston, MA; Awasthi, S., Beardmore, J., Clark, J., Hadridge, P., Madani, H., Marusic, A., Purcell, G., Ward, R., Five futures for academic medicine (2005) PLoS Medicine, 2 (7), p. 207; Botella, C., Etchemendy, E., Castilla, D., Baños, R.M., García-Palacios, A., Quero, S., Alcañiz, M., Lozano, J.A., An e-health system for the elderly (Butler project): A pilot study on acceptance and satisfaction (2009) CyberPsychology and Behavior, 12 (3), pp. 255-262; Burgess, D.C.H., Wasserman, J., Dahl, C.A., Global health diagnostics (2006) Nature, 444, pp. 1-2; Caulkins, J.P., Reuter, P., Iguchi, M.Y., Chiesa, J., (2003) Drug Use and Drug Policy Futures: Insights from a Colloquium, , Issue Paper IP-246-DPRC, RAND Corporation; Chatterji, S., Kowal, P., Mathers, C., Naidoo, N., Verdes, E., Smith, J.P., Suzman, R., The health of aging populations in China and India (2008) Health Affairs, 27 (4), pp. 1052-1063; Conti, J.P., Technology telepresence - I see live people (2007) Engineering Management Journal, 17 (3), pp. 12-15; Daar, A.S., Thorsteinsdóttir, H., Martin, D., Smith, A.C., Nast, S., Singer, P.A., Top ten biotechnologies for improving health in developing countries (2002) Nature Genetics, 32, pp. 229-232; Dentzer, S., The e-health connection: Information and communications technology and the developing world (2008) Health Affairs, 27 (6), pp. 1665-1670; Eysenbach, G., SARS and population health technology (2003) J.

It analyzes the key factors that appear to determine whether or not foresight, once launched by a government, can be successful. The study was performed by a team of researchers in Canada in the period 2005-2007. It found eight key factors, beyond the usual ones associated with the application of leading edge methods. The overall conclusion is that the methodology, appropriate budget and techniques alone are insufficient factors to explain the success of foresight programs. The interview results indicate that success is ultimately defined as the impact of the foresight exercise on government policy, and as the growth of the foresight function. Taken together, the results should help organizations establish the parameters for a successful foresight program. © Beech Tree Publishing 2010.",,"critical analysis; government; integrated approach; methodology; Canada",,,,,"Amanatidou, E., Guy, K., Interpreting foresight process impacts: Steps towards the development of a framework conceptualising the dynamics of 'foresight systems' (2006) Second International Seville Seminar On Future-oriented Technology Analysis, , Paper presented at the, held 28-29 September 2006, Seville, Spain; Barré, R., Keenan, M., Evaluation, impact and learning (2006) Second International Seville Seminar On Future-oriented Technology Analysis, , Paper presented at the, held 28-29 September 2006, Seville, Spain; Buetschi, D., Nentwich, M., (2000) The Role of Pta In the Policy Making Process, , EUROPTA Final Report.

The project succeeded in defining scenarios for the creative content industries, offering distinct trajectories and raising different policy challenges. The impact of the foresight on policy was limited, as it did not lead to direct policy measures, nevertheless, it confirmed some issues of major importance to the various stakeholders. © Beech Tree Publishing 2010.",,"implementation process; methodology; policy approach; real time; stakeholder",,,,,"(2006) Creating An Innovative Europe: Report of the Independent Expert Group On R&d and Innovation Appointed Following The Hampton Court Summit Chaired By Eski Aho, , Aho Expert Group, EUR 22005.

The authors describe the different stages of the method. It begins with a static graphic description of the system that will then be made dynamic through the identification of processes and quantified by state variables. This phase is of utmost importance since it provides the foundation for everything that follows. The most important processes are then transformed into hypotheses that either come to be or do not, one of the central points of the approach, before establishing a matrix of the influences of each hypothesis on the others. Breaking down these hypotheses into clusters of hypotheses that are more closely related among themselves than to the others allows us to build microscenarios. The idea of a scenario is discussed. The possibility of global scenarios and macroscenarios is explained. The presentation concludes with a discussion of research and action strategies. The conclusion focuses on the advantages of foresight studies for organizations, whether they are research oriented or not. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Many governments have realized that a single-issue focus is often insufficient in dealing with emerging threats and opportunities. They have therefore started to experiment with strategic foresight that deliberately cuts across the traditional boundaries of policy areas and government departments. This article reviews the foresight activities of three countries that have been at the forefront of this trend: the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the Netherlands. To this end, the article discusses the concept of strategic foresight and explains the two distinct ways in which it contributes to public policy-making: on the one hand, it informs policy by providing more systematic knowledge about relevant trends and developments in an organization's environments; on the other hand, it acts as a driver of reflexive mutual social learning processes among policy-makers that stimulate the generation of common public policy visions. The article concludes by drawing lessons with regard to the key success factors allowing strategic foresight to make an effective contribution to public policy-making. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Current levels of obesity in the population have been ≥30 years in the making. Not only will this position take time to reverse but there will be a considerable time lag before health and economic benefits are achieved through reductions in the morbidity from obesity-related diseases. There is clear evidence that policies aimed only at individuals will be inadequate and that increasing small-scale interventions will not suffice. Major action to prevent excess weight gain at a population level is required. The Foresight Report has confirmed that a whole system approach is critical. This approach will require a broad portfolio of integrated policy responses including both national and local measures. This strategy requires action by government, both central and local, industry and communities and by families and the societies in which they live.

Having played a big part in popularizing that first version, Patrick Cardon proposes, in order to avoid any misunderstanding and escape once for all from any attempts at reification, to use the term and the universal notion of transgender, which would cover the deconstructivist notions of queer, post-colonial and cultural studies, in order to give a place intelligently to ALL diversities beyond any binarism and with a foresight of future hybridity. © ICPHS 2010.",,,,,,,"Agacinski, S., (2002) Journal Interrompu, , 26 février.

It combines several FTA methods. Technologies that are potentially effective in biosecurity and in combating EID were first identified by bibliometric analysis, online survey and scenario planning. Roadmaps of these technologies were then built. Workshops to conduct the foresight process were held in the region. Four scenarios and six technology roadmaps for the region were developed. The results show that many future technologies will converge to become most effective in dealing with biosecurity and EID.

Drawing on developments based on Integral Theory, it then looks at how an emerging Integral Sustainability (IS) promises to enhance theory and practice in the sustainability field. In particular, the paper looks at how IS makes sense of sustainability challenges from an ontological position based on perspectives in place of objects (and their systems). A framework is outlined for understanding how various sustainability perspectives are constructed. This framework is then used to analyse a range of general perspectives the authors have identified that relate to nuclear power as a response to climate change. The strength of the IS approach is considered in the context of ongoing debate in Australia over the appropriateness of developing a local nuclear power industry as a response to climate change. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Special attention will be given to simple two-period overlapping generations models with a unique fixed point perfect foresight equilibrium; in this kind of scenario, eventual long-term periodic and a-periodic cycles are exclusively the result of the process of learning. The outcome that high rates of money growth have a potentially destabilizing effect generating periodic fluctuations and chaos is emphasized. The persistence of systematic forecast errors in a scenario where agents are supposed to act rationally is relevant in this context and it will be thoroughly discussed resorting to the notions of self-fulfilling mistakes, consistent expectations equilibria and beliefs equilibria. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Adaptive learning;

The generational interplay has many different facets and can be looked at from many various perspectives. This paper looks at a broader role of young people as agents of cultural change in societies, their relation to futures studies and the implications of their fresh ways of thinking for futures methods. Also, the past evolution of futures methods and the challenges facing the present and future generation of futurists in regard to methodological as well as general development are reviewed. In an effort to draw together these issues and provide practical ways forward for futurists and their field four integrating themes are addressed:•Allowing for differences, how do we develop solidarity between generations?•What does the near-future outlook tell us that might help to achieve this?•What personal, organisational and social capacities are needed?•What methods are available for building social foresight? © 2009.",,"conference proceeding; future prospect; methodology",,,,,"Gáspár, T., Nováky, E., Dilemmas for renewal of futures methodology (2002) Futures, 34, pp. 365-379; Hronszky, Drawing a historical lesson: toward prospective technology studies?, in: Futures Generation for Future Generations, Budapest, 2005, e-book [www.budapestfutures.org]; K.

Influenza vaccines provide diminished protection but are cost-saving in older adults (Foresight). J Intern Med 2010; 267: 220-227. Influenza is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in adults aged over 65 years. Although vaccination remains the most effective method of preventing influenza and its sequellae, current vaccination strategies provide less protection to older adults than to younger persons. Influenza vaccination in community-dwelling older adults is cost-effective, though there is room for improvement. Newer vaccine strategies considered for use in older adults include alternate routes of administration (intradermal or intranasal), addition of adjuvant, and novel methods of antigen presentation. Measuring cell-mediated immune response to new vaccines in addition to antibody response may correlate better with vaccine efficacy in this population. Whilst pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (pH1N1) has largely spared older adults, the impact of pH1N1 vaccination has yet to be determined. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Influenza; Older adults; Vaccine","influenza vaccine; antibody response; antigen presentation; cellular immunity; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; headache; human; influenza vaccination; Influenza virus A; injection site reaction; nose congestion; priority journal; review; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Vaccination; Vaccines, Virosome",,"Adjuvants, Immunologic; Influenza Vaccines; Vaccines, Virosome",,,"Thompson, W.W., Shay, D.K., Weintraub, E., Influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States (2004) JAMA, 292, pp. 1333-1340; Thompson, W.W., Shay, D.K., Weintraub, E., Brammer, L., Cox, N., Anderson, L.J., Fukuda, K., Mortality associated with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in the United States (2003) Journal of the American Medical Association, 289 (2), pp. 179-186. , DOI 10.1001/jama.289.2.179; Hak, E., Wei, F., Nordin, J., Mullooly, J., Poblete, S., Nichol, K.L., Development and validation of a clinical prediction rule for hospitalization due to pneumonia or influenza or death during influenza epidemics among community-dwelling elderly persons (2004) J Infect Dis, 189, pp. 450-458; Reichert, T.A., Simonsen, L., Sharma, A., Pardo, S.A., Fedson, D.S., Miller, M.A., Influenza and the winter increase in mortality in the United States, 1959-1999 (2004) Am J Epidemiol, 160, pp. 492-502; McMichael, A.J., Gotch, F.M., Noble, G.R., Beare, P.A., Cytotoxic T-cell immunity to influenza (1983) N Engl J Med, 309, pp. 13-7; Rimmelzwaan, G.F., McElhaney, J.E., Correlates of protection: Novel generations of influenza vaccines (2008) Vaccine, 26 (SUPPL. 4), pp. 41-4; Fiore, A.E., Shay, D.K., Broder, K., Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2009 (2009) MMWR Recomm Rep, 58, pp. 1-52; Govaert, Th.M.E., Thijs, C.T.M.C.N., Masurel, N., Sprenger, M.J.W., Dinant, G.J., Knottnerus, J.A., The efficacy of influenza vaccination in elderly individuals: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial (1994) Journal of the American Medical Association, 272 (21), pp. 1661-1665. , DOI 10.1001/jama.272.21.1661; Rivetti, D., Jefferson, T., Thomas, R., Vaccines for preventing influenza in the elderly (2006) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 3, p. 004876; Vu, T., Farish, S., Jenkins, M., Kelly, H., A meta-analysis of effectiveness of influenza vaccine in persons aged 65 years and over living in the community (2002) Vaccine, 20, pp. 1831-1836; Simonsen, L., Taylor, R.J., Viboud, C., Miller, M.A., Jackson, L.A., Mortality benefits of influenza vaccination in elderly people: An ongoing controversy (2007) Lancet Infect Dis, 7, pp. 658-666; Nichol, K.L., Nordin, J.D., Nelson, D.B., Mullooly, J.P., Hak, E., Effectiveness of influenza vaccine in the community-dwelling elderly (2007) N Engl J Med, 357, pp. 1373-1381; Nichol, K.L., Challenges in evaluating influenza vaccine effectiveness and the mortality benefits controversy (2009) Vaccine, 27, pp. 6305-6311; Carrat, F., Flahault, A., Influenza vaccine: The challenge of antigenic drift (2007) Vaccine, 25, pp. 6852-6862; De Jong, J.C., Beyer, W.E., Palache, A.M., Rimmelzwaan, G.F., Osterhaus, A.D., Mismatch between the 1997/1998 influenza vaccine and the major epidemic A(H3N2) virus strain as the cause of an inadequate vaccine-induced antibody response to this strain in the elderly (2000) J Med Virol, 61, pp. 94-9; Legrand, J., Vergu, E., Flahault, A., Real-time monitoring of the influenza vaccine field effectiveness (2006) Vaccine, 24, pp. 6605-6611; Doherty, P.C., Topham, D.J., Tripp, R.A., Cardin, R.D., Brooks, J.W., Stevenson, P.G., Effector CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell mechanisms in the control of respiratory virus infections (1997) Immunol Rev, 159, pp. 105-117; Hsu, H.C., Scott, D.K., Mountz, J.D., Impaired apoptosis and immune senescence - Cause or effect?

Design/methodology/approach: The technology foresight in 2003-2006 was organized by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. Based on two large rounds of Delphi investigations involving 1,400 experts and a SWOT analysis of every candidate technology, the key technologies were selected and the characteristics of them acquired. A large number of panels were organized to discuss and affirm the national needs and strategic tasks, so the logic relationships among the key items of NTRM could be clarified. Findings: Five national needs, 30 strategic tasks, and 90 key technologies were promoted, and their relationships constructed. The characteristics of all the 90 technologies, including their R&D basis, gap between their level and the levels of advanced countries, and the possible time needed to realize these technologies were evaluated. The NTRM of China was successfully formulated. Research limitations/implications: Only nine technology fields were considered in the Delphi investigations, because of the limited study conditions. This might become the limitation to the application of this NTRM. In further study, more technology fields should be involved and all the processes finished as soon as possible. Social implications: The results of the NTRM were partly adopted by the 11th science and technology plan of China. Through the progress of NTRM, agreements concerning the key technologies and their development roadmaps were made. Both the NTRM and its compiling process provide important reference points for scientific and technological managers, scientists, and entrepreneurs, because they will help to make better decisions and contribute greatly to the research and development of the technologies. Originality/value: This is the first attempt in China to make a NTRM. Results from the large-scale Delphi investigations were taken as the basis for the roadmapping. The model of ""national needs-strategic tasks-key technologies-development priorities"" was promoted and the technology roadmapping at a national level was conducted successfully. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Delphi method; Government policy; Technology led strategy",,,,,,"Albright, R.E., Kappel, T.A., Roadmapping in the corporation (2003) Research Technology Management, 42 (2), pp. 31-40; Barker, D., Smith, D.J.H., Technology foresight using roadmaps (1995) Long Range Planning, 28 (2), pp. 21-28; Galvin, R., Science roadmaps (1998) Science, 280 (5365), p. 803; Groenveld, P., Roadmapping integrates business and technology (1997) Research Technology Management, 40 (5), pp. 48-55; (2009) Strategic technology roadmap 2009: Roadmap for strategic planning and implementation of R&D investment, , www.meti.go.jp/english/press/data/20090430_01.html, available at Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Tokyo METI; Nimmo, G., (2004) Industry Canada technology roadmapping: A strategy for success, , http://roadmap.ecn.purdue.edu/CTR/documents/13_Technology_Road_Mapping.pdf, available at; Phaal, R., (2002) Foresight Vehicle Technology Roadmap - Technology and Research Directions for Future Road Vehicles, , UK Department of Trade and Industry, URN, London; (2008) China's Report of Technology Foresight 2006-2007, , Science and Technology Document Publishing House, Beijing Research Group of Technology Foresight; (1993) Semiconductor Technology Workshop Working Group Reports, , Semiconductor Industry Association, San Jose, CA SIA; Strauss, J., Radnor, M., Peterson, J., Plotting and navigating a non-linear roadmap: Knowledge-based roadmapping for emerging and dynamic environments (1998) Proceedings of the East Asian Conference on Knowledge Creation Management, March 6-7, Singapore; Wang, L., National technology roadmap of Korea (2005), www.chinainfo.gov.cn/data/200501/1_20050131_1027.html, available at; Willyard, C.H., McClees, C.W., Motorola's technology roadmap process (1987) Research Management, 30 (6), pp. 13-19","Li, Z.; Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, MOST, Beijing, China; email: lizx@casted.org.cn",,,,,,,,1758552X,,,,"English","J.

Leadership, responsiveness, and creativity, as well as stability and practicality, were put to the test in the intense summer and fall months of 2008. Major financial institutions failed or sat on the brink of failure, liquidity froze, the credit market vanished, foreclosure rates soared, and the government struggled to prevent further economic collapse. Just as critically, the capacities of regulatory foresight and independence, along with long-standing regulatory procedures, had in effect been tested in the decade leading up to the crisis. What was the impact of the Bush Administration's management of the financial regulatory bureaucracy over his eight-year presidency? What was its impact in the midst of the crisis at the close of his last term? This paper examines the longer-term capacity of foresight - the expertise and independence to see a crisis on the horizon and to speak truth to power in the midst of economic boom time - and the short-term capacities of responsive competence in the form of policy and administrative answers to the immediate challenges of the crisis itself.

This paper explores the socio-technical developments that the next 25 years might bring and the implications of such developments for educators and for educational technology research. The paper begins by outlining the diverse approaches to educational futures that are currently visible in the field, and suggests four principles to underpin future thinking in educational technology. It then describes the methods used to inquire into long-term socio-technical futures in the 2-year Beyond Current Horizons Programme. These included a foresight and scenario development process bringing together evidence reviews and insights from over 100 researchers from disciplines as diverse as computer science, demography and sociology of childhood, as well as consultation with over 130 organizations and individuals from industry, practice and educational beneficiary groups. The outcomes of this programme are then presented, including a set of future scenarios for education and a set of socio-technical developments that might underpin such scenarios. The scenarios emerge from three future worlds ('Trust Yourself', 'Loyalty Points' and 'Only Connect'), and from projections including: changing demography, new human-machine relations and a weakening of institutional boundaries. The paper then argues that the next 25 years will challenge our current organization of education around the unit of the individual child, the school and the discourses of the knowledge economy; and will require the development of new approaches to curriculum, cross-institutional relationships, workforce development and decision-making in education. Finally, the paper argues that these developments challenge educational technology research to move beyond pedagogy to curriculum; beyond the school to the community, home and workplace; and beyond social sciences to collaborations with medical and bio-ethics fields. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Educational change; Ethics; Futures; Policy; Technology",,,,,,"Adam, B., Groves, C., (2007) Future Matters: Action, Knowledge and Ethics., , Brill.

The intention is to characterize several main events, inventions and circumstances that have conducted the evolution of this pervasive method together with broader participation and a changing focus of foresight over time. Design/methodology/approach: The assumption is that foresight has evolved as a consequence of increasing uncertainties that bring globalization and technological progress, and that it is a specific form of very long-term participative strategic planning. It is impossible to directly link the increasing uncertainties in the global environment and the spread of foresight. However, it is possible to compare the history of foresight in relation to the history of globalization through several main historical events, inventions and initiatives typical for both evolutions. These events were primarily selected based on The History of the World. The inventions were primarily voted as the ""Invention of the Year"" in different industries and the foresight initiatives were selected from the European Foresight Monitoring Network (EFMN). The study was based on an intensive literature review and comparison, and complemented by the foresight history bibliometrical statistics of the EFMN database in order to see how exactly foresight has evolved and changed over time. Findings: The paper provides a comprehensive insight into the history of foresight based on the description of the main foresight generations and their characterization. What can be claimed based on this study is that foresight has its predecessors and conditional evolution. According to the study, the evolution of foresight is connected with the establishment of China in 1949, where the government and many specialists worked together on the long-term S&T development strategy that had many elements of foresight. Since that time, many countries have benefited from this synergic participative long-term planning. Foresight has been successful and has spread to more and more countries, which is obvious from the increasing rate of new initiatives every year. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this theme and the diversity of specialists' opinions do not allow overly excessive analyses. The main approach here is to identify the fundamental development of foresight in relation to several key historical events and the history of forecasting and globalization, and to outline several linkages. Second, there are significant differences in dating foresight as a new developing scientific discipline in many countries over time. Lastly, the opinions of experts differ too much considering the difference between foresight and forecasting. Practical implications: The paper includes appeals for further detailed studies/hindsight and discussion of each foresight generation mainly in relation to its real effectiveness, especially in countries like China, Japan, the USA, Germany, France and the UK, which have been applying foresight for 20 to 50 years. This is especially important in order to develop foresight as a purposeful effective scientific discipline. Originality/value: The paper is a clear comprehensive analysis of foresight history. Its key added value lies in the comprehensive insight into three subsequent tables and figures that depict foresight in relation to the milestones of globalization and the world history. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forecasting;

Foresight and competitive intelligence are two fields that seek to address future oriented environmental scanning. The paper looks at what the domains of foresight and competitive intelligence entail and in particular how competitive technical intelligence can work to integrate and enable competitive agility in foresight positioning. Focus is put on reviewing literature that addresses how foresight impacts R&D project selection. A review is made on foresight programs from around the world based on a recently completed study on Canada's foresight capacity. The authors conclude that agile organizations need to be adaptive and well prepared for tomorrow's challenges and so by integrating competitive technical intelligence, (typically oriented to business needs) with strategic technology foresight, (typically designed to address government priorities for technology investments and innovation policy issues), enterprises will be best positioned to address uncertainties in the technology cycle. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Ashton, B.W., Johnson, A.H., Stacey, G.S., Monitoring science and technology for competitive advantage (1994) Competitive Intelligence Review, 5 (1), pp. 5-16; Ashton, B.W., Klavans, R.A., (1997) Keeping Abreast of Science and Technology: Technical Intelligence for Business, , Columbus, OH.

This article discusses challenges in strategic foresight in relation to transdisciplinarity based on empirical as well as theoretical work in technological domains. By strategic foresight is meant future oriented, participatory consultation of actors and stakeholders, both within and outside a scientific community. It therefore allows multiple stakeholders to negotiate over how to attain a desirable future. This requires creative thinking from the participants, who need to extend their knowledge into the uncertainty of the future. Equally important is skilled facilitating in order to create a space for dialogue and exploration in a contested territory. Although strategic foresight has now been widely accepted for strategy-making and priority-setting in science and innovation policy, the methodologies underpinning it still need further development. Key findings are the identification of challenges, aspects and issues related to management and facilitation of strategic foresight exercises in complex systemic contexts that transcend science in relation to both the persons and problems involved. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Aagaard, K., (2003) Forskningspolitik og tværdisciplinaritet: Rapport fra Analyseinstitut for Forskning (in Danish), , The Danish Institute for Studies in Research and Research Policy, Århus, Denmark; Borch, K., Merida, F., (2007) Dialogue in Foresight: Consensus, Conflict and Negotiation, , COST-A22 Final Conference, Athens, Greece, 9–11 July 2007; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., (1999) Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Currie-Alder, B., (2003) Why Participation?

The networks and knowledge maps can be depicted differently by choosing different information as the network actor, e.g. author, institute or country keyword, to reflect knowledge structures in micro-, meso-, and macro-levels, respectively. Technology Foresight is selected as an example to illustrate the method proposed in this study. A total of 556 author keywords contained in 181 Technology Foresight related papers have been analyzed. European countries, China, India and Brazil are located at the core of Technology Foresight research. Quantitative ways of mapping journal papers are investigated in this study to unveil emerging elements as well as to demonstrate dynamics and visualization of knowledge. The quantitative method provided in this paper shows a possible way of visualizing and evaluating knowledge structure; thus a computerized calculation is possible for potential quantitative applications, e.g. R&D resource allocation, research performance evaluation, science map, etc. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Keyword; Knowledge structure; Network theory; Technology Foresight",,,,,,"Alsan, A., Oner, M.A., An integrated view of foresight: Integrated foresight management model (2003) Foresight, 5, pp. 33-45; Amsteus, M., Managerial foresight: Concept and measurement (2008) Foresight, 10, pp. 53-66; Baldwin, C., Hughes, J., Hope, T., Jacoby, R., Ziebland, S., Ethics and dementia: Mapping the literature by bibliometric analysis (2003) International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 18, pp. 41-54; Bhattacharya, S., Basu, P.K., Mapping a research area at the micro level using co-word analysis (1998) Scientometrics, 43, pp. 359-372; Callon, M., Courtial, J.P., Laville, F., Co-word analysis as a tool for describing the network of interactions between basic and technological research: The case of polymer chemistry (1991) Scientometrics, 22, pp. 155-205; Cambrosio, A., Limoges, C., Courtial, J.P., Laville, F., Historical scientometrics?

The Delphi questionnaires were developed throughout the foresight process in relation to the responses given by participants in bibliometric and SWOT analysis conducted prior to the Delphi survey. In this paper, Turkey's renewable energy future is evaluated using the Delphi method. A two-round Delphi research study was undertaken to determine and measure the expectations of the sector representatives regarding the foresight of renewable energies. First and second round of Delphi study were carried out by using online surveys. About 382 participants responded in the first round of the Delphi questionnaire yielding a respond rate of 20.1%, whereas 325 participants responded at the second round yielding a respond rate of 84.9%. About 50% of Turkey's energy demand was foresighted to be met by renewable energies around 2030. The results showed that all types of renewable energies would not only provide economic and environmental benefits but also improve living standards. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The presented model is implemented as an extension to a large, linear optimization model, MESSAGE. The motivation behind changing the model is to provide an alternative decision framework, where information for the full time frame is not available immediately and sequential decision making under incomplete information is implied. While the traditional optimization framework provides the globally optimal decisions for the modeled problem, the framework presented here may offer a better description of the decision environment, under which decision makers must operate. We further modify the model to accommodate flexible dynamic constraints, which give an option to implement investments faster, albeit with a higher cost. Finally, the operation of the model is demonstrated using a moving window of foresight, with which decisions are taken for the next 30 years, but can be reconsidered later, when more information becomes available. We find that the results demonstrate some of the pitfalls of short term planning, e.g. lagging investments during earlier periods lead to higher requirements later during the century. Furthermore, the energy system remains more reliant on fossil based energy carriers, leading to higher greenhouse gas emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our hypothesis is that the mediation that takes place during the foresight process helped by simulation is effective in highlighting the main issues at the local/regional scale, as well as the more probable adaptation strategies, thus making it possible to validate issues found for other scales of analysis. We analyze the foresight processes in five companion modelling (ComMod) projects on the co-evolution of extensive husbandry systems (EHS) and territories scale in France, Senegal, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. The processes are broken down according to the scenario study objectives, to the method of construction and to the parameters associated with models and simulations. Comparative analysis contributes to improving the design of future ComMod experiments on EHS and reveals a more operational definition of local, regional and global issues which the EES of these regions will face in the next decade.","Extensive husbandry; Modelling; Participatory approaches; Prospective; Territories",,,,,,"Bah, A., Touré, I., Fourage, C., Diop Gaye, I., Leclerc, G., Soumaré, A., Unmodèle multi-agents pour étudier les politiques d'affectation des terres et leurs impacts sur les dynamiques pastorales et territoriales au Ferlo (Sénégal) (2010) Cah Agric, 19. , epub.

In some sense, both episodic memory and episodic foresight may be regarded as two sides of the same capacity to travel mentally in time. After reviewing some of the recent evidence for commonalities, I discuss limits of these parallels. There are fundamental differences between thinking about past and future events that need to be kept in clear view if we are to make progress in understanding the nature ofmental time travel. The reviewed evidence suggests that mental time travel is based on a complex system selected not for accuracy about past and future per se, but for fitness benefits. Functional analyses promise to lead to fruitful avenues for future research. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,,,,"Suddendorf, T., Busby, J., Mental time travel in animals?

Some legal philosophers have defended this rule by appeal to an alleged difference in the ""moral character"" or ""intentional structure"" of intended versus non-intended harms. I argue that there are reasons to be skeptical of any such differences; and that even if conceded, it is only on the basis of an unworkable view of criminal responsibility that such a distinction would support a rule restricting attempts to criminal purpose. I defend instead the ""continuity thesis,"" according to which attempts are functionally continuous with endangerment offenses: both are legal efforts to regulate unreasonably dangerous conduct. The upshot of the continuity thesis is that there is little substantive difference between attempt and endangerment in principle, no matter how they are labeled in law. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Attempt; Foresight; Intention; Mens rea",,,,,,"Alexander, L., Kessler, K., Mens rea and inchoate crimes (1997) Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 87 (4), pp. 1138-1193; Anscombe, G.E.M., Action, intention and 'double effect (2001) The Doctrine of Double Effect, pp. 50-66. , P.

It is based on the observation that decision makers often do not seem to fully distinguish between different but seemingly similar decisions and tend to treat such similar decisions in a standardised/habitual way. To capture this, each player's information partition is derived from a similarity grouping of decisions based on the local structure of the game - equality of available actions and analogy of locally foreseen subtrees - and possibly refined by additional information about crucial aspects of past play. The equilibrium concept considered is a (trembling-hand) perfect Nash equilibrium (Selten, 1975), in which players are required to choose the same (routine) behaviour for similar decisions. Based on the approach, it is shown how the Chain Store Paradox (Selten, 1978) can be resolved, and how mixed equilibria in the Centipede Game (Rosenthal, 1981) can be rationalised. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Bounded rationality; Chain Store Paradox; Finite automata; Imperfect recall; Limited foresight; Reasoning by analogy",,,,,,"Abreu, D., Rubinstein, A., The structure of Nash equilibrium in repeated games with finite automata (1988) Econometrica, 56, pp. 1259-1281; Aumann, R., Note on the centipede game (1998) Games Econ.

In this paper it is suggested that, following this epistemology, not only the answers to scientific questions, but even the questions themselves should be replaced. Particularly, instead of asking whether some form of future-oriented cognition might be unique to humans, and what are the ""causes"" of such capacities; it might be more productive to ask, in the framework of the structural-systemic epistemology, what level of analysis corresponds to future-oriented capacities, and in what form their structure is organized. The structural-systemic theory of functional systems by the Russian physiologist Piotr Anokhin is described, where it is shown that future orientation is the central characteristic of living systems. Furthermore, it is an essential property of all life-forms as wholes. Therefore understanding of future-oriented capacities requires description of what Anokhin called functional systems, systems that can be found in all life forms. Starting from Anokhin's structural-systemic epistemology, it is possible to go further and build a developmental theory of different kinds of future-orientation. It is proposed that future-orientation as a characteristic of life has evolved into psychical future-oriented cognition. From there, in turn, qualitatively novel forms of semiotically mediated future-oriented processes have emerged. Building a theory of future-oriented capacities in this direction seems to be scientifically more productive than continuing the theory-building following the fundamentally limited Cartesian epistemology. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Anokhin's theory of functional systems; Cartesian epistemology; Foresight; Future-orientation; Mental time travel; Structural-systemic epistemology",,,,,,"Anokhin, P.K., Uzlovyje mekhanizmy funktsional'noi sistemy kak apparata samoreguljatsii.

We integrate key features of rational addiction theory into a discrete-choice model of the demand for a differentiated product. We find that following the MSA firms set prices on a more elastic region of their demand curves. Using these estimates, we predict prices that would be charged under a variety of industry structures and pricing rules. Under the assumptions of firms' perfect foresight and constant marginal costs, we fail to reject the hypothesis that firms collude on a dynamic pricing strategy.

What about the control failures in the recent global financial crisis? Behind these apparently very different events, it is possible to identify a common element of organizational myopia - a syndrome that severely limits the capacity of organizations to foresee the effects of their own decisions and to recognize signs of danger or opportunity. Organizational Myopia explores the barriers that impede organizations from identifying an effective response to the problems that they have to confront. Using real-world cases, the author investigates the mechanisms that generate myopia in organizations at the individual, organizational, and interorganizational level in contexts that are complex, uncertain, ambiguous, and changeable. This book will help readers understand how to limit the origins of myopia and therefore increase the capacity of organizations to anticipate and contain unexpected events. © Maurizio Catino 2013.",,,,,,,"Abramson, N.R., Senyshyn, Y., Effective Punishment through Forgiveness: Rediscovering Kierkegaard’s Knight of Faith in the Abraham Story (2010) Organization Studies, 31 (5), pp. 555-581; Ahrne, G., Brunsson, N., Organizing the World (2006) Transnational Governance: Institutional Dynamics of Regulation, pp. 74-94. , M.L.

Using agents' minimum foresight concerning possible future payoffs, Maskin and Tirole (Rev Econ Stud 66:83-114, 1999) show that indescribability does not matter for contractual incompleteness as long as there is symmetric information at both the contracting stage and the trading stage. This is called the irrelevance theorem. The following generalization of the irrelevance theorem is shown here: indescribability does not matter even in the presence of asymmetric information at the trading stage, as long as there is symmetric information at the contracting stage. This is an important clarification because Kunimoto (Econ Lett 99:367-370, 2008) shows that indescribability can matter if there is asymmetric information at both stages. It is thus argued that asymmetric information at the contracting stage is necessary for indescribability to be important in the rational agents contracting model. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Asymmetric information; Bayesian implementation; Incentive compatibility; Incomplete contracts; Indescribability; Individual rationality; Irrelevance theorem",,,,,,"Che, Y.-K., Hausch, D., Cooperative investments and the value of contracting (1999) Am Econ Rev, 89, pp. 125-147; Dewatripont, M., Tirole, J., Modes of communication (2005) J Polit Econ, 113, pp. 1217-1238; Grossman, S.J., Hart, O.D., The costs and benefits of ownership: A theory of vertical and lateral integration (1986) J Polit Econ, 94, pp. 691-719; Hart, O., Moore, J., Property rights and the nature of the firm (1990) J Polit Econ, 98, pp. 1119-1158; Hart, O., Moore, J., Foundations of incomplete contracts (1999) Rev Econ Stud, 66, pp. 115-138; Kunimoto, T., Indescribability and asymmetric information at the contracting stage (2008) Econ Lett, 99, pp. 367-370; Maskin, E., On indescribable contingencies and incomplete contracts (2002) Eur Econ Rev, 46, pp. 725-733; Maskin, E., Tirole, J., Unforeseen contingencies and incomplete contracts (1999) Rev Econ Stud, 66, pp. 83-114; Mookherjee, D., Reichelstein, S., Implementation via augmented revelation mechanisms (1990) Rev Econ Stud, 57, pp. 453-475; Segal, I., Complexity and renegotiation: A foundation for incomplete contracts (1999) Rev Econ Stud, 66, pp. 57-82; Tirole, J., Incomplete contracts: Where do we stand?

The analyses are based on a pre-foresight exercise to examine the potential of the bio-based energy and investigate a set of development policies necessary for the direction of energy system development.

Many of the directions set in the report have already been remarkably accurate, but fiscal constraints stemming from the global recession that began in 2008 will have a significant impact on academia and on the future of the veterinary profession. Three primary forces will shape veterinary education in the coming decade: (1) the urgent need to lead an integrated approach to animal, human, and environmental health; (2) the continued information explosion; and (3) the challenge of delivering high-quality veterinary clinical training at a time of fiscal restraint. Despite economic woes and financial pressure, this is the time to rethink veterinary medical education.

Since these rules, translated into mating patterns, would imply inbreeding, the question arises as to their long-term population genetic effects. We show by simulation that continuous unilateral or bilateral cross-cousin mating, reflecting the most common form of prescribed marriage, increases homozygosity but at the same time slows down considerably the loss of gene diversity due to genetic drift. For X-chromosomal genes, this effect is more pronounced if marriage, translated into mating, is matrilateral rather than patrilateral. Although the maintenance of gene diversity, in principle, could have conferred a selective advantage to the initiation of marriage rules, the mechanisms driving such a move are difficult to perceive.We therefore conclude that the possible preservation of gene diversity through marriage rule-induced inbreeding is a by-product, not the source, of a cultural invention that instead rested on foresight and strategic thinking. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Gene diversity; Genetic drift; Inbreeding; Marriage rule; Population genetics; Social evolution","article; consanguineous marriage; controlled study; gene loss; genetic association; genetic drift; genetic variability; homozygosity; inbreeding; mate choice; priority journal; process model; X chromosome",,,,,"Bittles, A.H., Endogamy, consanguinity and community disease profiles (2005) Community Genetics, 8 (1), pp. 17-20. , DOI 10.1159/000083332; Bittles, A.H., Black, M.L., Evolution in health and medicine sackler colloquium: Consanguinity, human evolution, and complex diseases (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 17, pp. 1779-1786; Dumont, L., (1957) Hierarchy and Marriage Alliance in South Indian Kinship, , (occasional papers of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland No. 12).

Collip's story is significant as a case study as it lends nuance to the picture of the Canadian inventor, shows the daring foresight of early Canadian commercialization business models, and explores the influences that eventually led to the development of university technology transfer offices in Canada. It also highlights germinal moments in the negotiation of standardized agreements and university-industry partnerships. Ultimately, this paper contributes to the task of filling out the history of the development of legal norms regarding intellectual property in Canada by exploring sources outside of case law and legislation to tell a rich story of invention, ownership, and profit.","Collip; Emmenin; history; medicine; Patents; trade-mark",,,,,,,"Marier, V.",,,,,,,,00420220,,,,"English","Univ.

For our purpose we develop the money-in-the-utility-function approach. We assume the rigidity of the price level in the commodity market, and hence adopt a quantity adjustment mechanism, where the quantity of output moves infinitely fast to clear the commodity market. In addition, we presuppose that policy makers follow a constant growth rule for the nominal money supply. Within the particular model, we show that deflationary monetary policy causes a cumulative depression, which appears as a perfect foresight equilibrium path. On this path the consumption level approaches zero eventually. Equally important, we draw attention to the result of inflationary monetary. In this case, policy makers avoid completely the emergence of deep depressions. Namely, inflationary monetary policy is a successful tool for eliminating the cumulative depressions that may arise under deflationary monetary policy. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of fiscal policy. While an independent use of fiscal policy cannot rule out the cumulative depressions, a combination of fiscal and monetary policies stimulates economic activity. In this sense, fiscal policy is effective in achieving and maintaining the efficiency of the economy. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,,,,,"Benassy, J.-P., Nonclearing markets: Microeconomic concepts and macroeconomic applications (1993) Journal of Economic Literature, 31, pp. 732-761; Bohm, V., Disequilibrium dynamics in a simple macroeconomic model (1978) Journal of Economic Theory, 17, pp. 179-199; Brock, W.A., Money and growth: The case of long run perfect foresight (1974) International Economic Review, 15, pp. 750-777; Brock, W.A., A simple perfect foresight monetary model (1975) Journal of Monetary Economics, 1, pp. 133-150; Calvo, G.A., Staggered prices in a utility-maximizing framework (1983) Journal of Monetary Economics, 12, pp. 383-398; Farmer, R.E.A., (1996) The Macroeconomics of Self-Fulfilling Prophecies, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Flaschel, P., On the dominance of the Keynesian regime in disequilibrium growth theory: a Note (1999) Journal of Economics, 70, pp. 79-89; Friedman, M., Schwartz, A.J., (1963) Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Gordon, R.J., Wilcox, J.A., Monetarist Interpretations of the Great Depression: An Evaluation and Critique (1981) The Great Depression Revisited, pp. 49-107. , In K.

To be efficient, the human-robot system must be able to anticipate, react and recover from errors of different kinds, i. e., to be resilient. From this observation, this paper proposes a survey on the resilience of a human-machine system and the means to control the resilience. The resilience of a system can be defined as the ability to maintain or recover a stable state when subject to disturbance. Adjustable autonomy and human-machine cooperation are considered as means of resilience for the system. This paper then proposes three indicators to assess different meanings of resilience of the system: foresight and avoidance of events, reaction to events and recovery from occurrence of events. The third of these metrics takes into consideration the concept of affordances that allows a common representation for the opportunities of action between the automated system and its environment. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Adjustable autonomy; Affordances; Human-machine cooperation; Human-machine systems; Resilience","Adjustable autonomy; Affordances; Human-machine cooperation; Human-machine systems; Resilience; Automation; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mice (computer peripherals); Recovery; Remotely operated vehicles; Man machine systems",,,,,"Amalberti, R., Optimum system safety and optimum system resilience: Agonistic or antagonistic concepts?

The article discusses not only the expert sights on hydrogen technologies but also all bibliometrical approaches. The results showed that the hydrogen economy will enhance innovations as well as economic prosperities with the support of appropriate policies. Formulating such policies requires a timely and detailed understanding of the latest R&D trends and developments in science and technology policy in all developed countries, and the comprehensive analysis of these developments to enable accurate predictions of future science and technology trends.

Many problems requiring maintenance and repair could have been mitigated or prevented with a little foresight and coordination during the design and construction period. Why is so much effort expended on ""repairing the repairs""? This paper discusses how common mistakes occur and why. Many of the perceived restraints on the design and construction phases such as time, budget, level of craftsmanship, and material costs do and should affect the project. However, these constraints must be balanced against the functionality of the masonry, such as durability, structural stability, weather barrier, and aesthetics. Through real-life examples, this paper describes a simple repair of rehabilitation process that will lead to a successful project outcome: Long lasting, low maintenance masonry structures. It takes into account the owner's needs, priorities, and budgetary, physical, and time constraints before any design development or repair begins. For comparison, unsuccessful project outcomes from actual projects will also be explored.

What he was referring to is emotional intelligence, the product of two main factors - personal and social competency - without which one cannot envisage the human personality of the 21st century. Emotions have taught humanity how to think, Luc de Vauvenargues said. Those emotions that are not dealt with disrupt the mind and body while those emotions that are transformed in abilities ensure a better productivity, more satisfactions derived from everyday activities and positive interpersonal relationships, they drive us to assume accountability as well as bolster up our self-control, among many other things. Our attempt to develop and optimize the involvement of emotions in achieving individual success was aimed at the following objectives: • Discovering the four unique areas of EQ: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management • Developing EQ through the use of specific techniques • Using EQ for: cognitive and interrelational advantages, lowering stress level, the increase of individual productivity, comprehending emotions, positively interacting with others, etc. This paper deals exactly with the most efficient methods of developing emotional intelligence in children. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Emotional intelligence; Empathy; Methods of developing; Self - motivation; Social and personal competency",,,,,,"Albrecht, K., (2006) Social Intelligence - The New Science of Succes, , Published by Jossey-Bass.

Casavecchia was referring to Machiavelli's foresight in contributing to the recapture of Pisa through the institution of the militia, which is not what we mean by philosophy today. Nevertheless, Casavecchia put his finger on the quality that contemporaries admired about Machiavelli, namely, the originality of his thinking in a broader context. Machiavelli never wrote systematically about his understanding of philosophical issues, to which ancient thinkers contributed as much as contemporary politics and religion, nor are we sure that his ideas can be described as a coherent whole. On the contrary, his view of the cosmos and of man's nature as unchanging seems difficult to reconcile with the flexibility he demanded in the field of politics, where his ideas about republicanism, princely rule, and religion seem equally at odds. The starting point for describing Machiavelli's outlook has always been his letter to Francesco Vettori on December 10, 1513, describing the origins of The Princeas the outcome of both practical political experience and the influence of the classics. The practical experience consisted of his work in the chancery and diplomatic missions, which stressed the importance of rules, models, and necessary procedures and encouraged in him a skeptical and somewhat fatalistic approach to life. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,,,,,,"Machiavelli, (1971) Tutte Le Opere, 1108p. , ed.

E. Housman once began a book review, ‘There is much in this book that is true and much that is new. But that which is true is not new and that which is new is not true’ (Naiditch, 1988). Are there any lessons to be learned about implementing the genetics of crop production into policy that are new or true? Picked up in a recent report titled The Future of Food and Farming: Challenges and Choices for Global Sustainability (Foresight, 2011) is the growing international unease that global action is required to avert future global food security crises, and that we will need the best science, technology and innovation to address the challenge. The remarkable successes of the modern era have come from scientific research and the talents and dedication of some of the very bestminds and research teams in the world. The lesson for today’s citizens is to grasp a communal vision for an adventure in the pursuit and wise application of knowledge. It is essential to create a climate of well-justified confidence in scientific and technological progress as described by Jack Bobo and Roger Beachy in Chapter 19, restore self-assurance in the processes of accountability and equity as outlined by Mark Cantley and Drew Kershen in their Chapter 16, and enhance the opportunities that exist for rewarding collaboration that can promote synergy and economies of scale if managed positively. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,,,,,,"Alleyne, R., (2008) Europe’s GM Food Fear 'Exacerbates famine’, Daily Telegraph, , www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/2700176/Europes-GM-food-fear-exacerbates-famine.html, 7 September; (2006) GM Food: Europeans Still See More Risks than Benefits, , www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/stories/227.eurobarometer_euro-peans_biotechnology.html,page37, GMO Compass; (2011) The Future of Food and Farming: Challenges and Choices for Global Sustainability, , Final Project Report.

In social network analysis, it is a usual problem that information for determining whether or not a network tie should be formed is missing for some network actors, and thus network can only be partially constructed due to unavailability of information. This methodology proposed in this study is based on network actors' similarities calculations by Vector-Space Model to calculate how possible network ties can be formed. Also, a threshold value of similarity for deciding whether or not a network tie should be generated is suggested in this study. Four ontology-based knowledge networks, with journal paper or research project as network actors, constructed previously are selected as the targets of this empirical study: (1) Technology Foresight Paper Network: 181 papers and 547 keywords, (2) Regional Innovation System Paper Network: 431 papers and 1165 keywords, (3) Global Sci-Tech Policy Paper Network: 548 papers and 1705 keywords, (4) Taiwan's Sci-Tech Policy Project Network: 143 research projects and 213 keywords. The four empirical investigations allow a cut-off threshold value calculated by Vector-Space Model to be suggested for deciding the formation of network ties when network linkage information is unavailable. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Cut-off value; Keyword; Knowledge network; Network formation; Social network; Vector-Space Model",,,,,,"Barabasi, A.L., Albert, R., Emergence of scaling in random networks (1999) Science, 286 (5439), pp. 509-512; Brass, D.J., Burkhardt, M.E., Centrality and power in organizations (1992) Networks and Organizations: Structure, Form and Action, pp. 191-215. , N.

Big sustainable success does not happen overnight. These experiences remind us that it takes a winning team comprising champions - leaders who share a vision for improved community health, coaches who share their tools, knowledge, and wisdom; team players who put their best game forward; and fans, the public that stands to benefit the most from the team's greatness. It is not just about winning and success or for public health accreditation or QI. That would be shortsighted. We could ascribe success to that 20/20 vision we know as professional hindsight - where we look at a situation/decision after it has happened, knowing and appreciating what we now see and how we can use that knowledge to improve. We also know hindsight is not always 20/20. We can have the foresight, even when fraught with uncertainty, to recruit the best and the brightest and hold them accountable; design a plan for success that survives the pressures of execution; adapt what we learn from our successes and failures; and celebrate small, incremental successes.

Whereas these approaches have treated all competing firms equally as Nash players, one firm may have an advantage over its rivals, e. g., more pre-experience on competitors' behavior and/or a first-mover advantage. This paper proposes a Stackelberg-Nash (leader-followers) model which can accomodate such information for decision making. The optimal product design problem is formulated from the perspective of a profit-maximizing new entrant (the leader) who wants to launch a brand onto an existing product market and acts with foresight by anticipating price-design reactions of the incumbent firms (the Nash followers). In the absence of closed-form solutions, we use a sequential iterative procedure to compute a Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium and to establish its uniqueness. The new conjoint model is illustrated under several competitive scenarios and price, design and profit implications are compared to a simple Nash equilibrium model. We find that a Stackelberg leader strategy may not only yield a much higher profit for the new entrant than a Nash strategy, but may also lead to strong profit asymmetries between competitors with still higher profits for the incumbent firms. In other words, the incumbent firms may also benefit strongly from a new entrant choosing a Stackelberg leader strategy. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Conjoint analysis; Game theory; Optimal product design; Product competition",,,,,,"Albers, S., Brockhoff, K., A comparison of two approaches to the optimal positioning of a new product in an attribute space (1979) Zeitschrift Opera Res, 23, pp. 127-142; Albritton, M.D., McMullen, P.R., Optimal product design using a colony of virtual ants (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 176, pp. 498-520; Alexouda, G., An evolutionary algorithm approach to the share of choices problem in the product line design (2004) Computers Oper Res, 31, pp. 2215-2229; Alexouda, G., Paparrizos, K., A genetic algorithm approach to the product line design problem using the seller's return criterion: An extensive comparative computational study (2001) Eur J Oper Res, 134, pp. 165-178; Aubin, J.P., (1979) Mathematical Methods of Game and Economic Theory, , Amsterdam: North-Holland; Baier, D., Methoden der Conjoint-Analyse in der Marktforschungs- und Marketingpraxis (1999) Mathematische Methoden Der Wirtschaftswissenschaften, Festschrift für Otto Opitz, pp. 197-206. , W.

Through his eponymous publishing firm, he subsequently went on to contribute more than any other individual to furthering modern study of the early literatures and cultures of these islands. An irrepressibly positive and genial personality, his humanity and kindness as a teacher, scholar and publisher enabled and changed many lives. In a sixty-year career as a critic of medieval English and other literature, Brewer foresaw and pioneered much that has since developed into defining aspects of the field. Far from being a backward-looking memorial volume or Festschrift, the present book celebrates how some of the topics Brewer made central to the study of medieval literature are being taken forward, both because of his influence and beyond it. In so doing, this book aims to build towards an intellectual biography of a very modern medievalist. Derek Brewer was born into a relatively modest background, the son of a clerk with the General Electric Company. Educated at his local Crypt Grammar School in Gloucester, he won a scholarship (‘demyship’) to Magdalen College, Oxford for the year 1941–42. As he later remarked, ‘getting to Oxford to read English had been my heart's desire’, and he wrote in his eighties that Magdalen was still, for him, simply the most beautiful place in the world. But after one short year at Oxford he joined the army and in 1944 was posted to Italy; he taught himself Italian on the troopship with the aid of a Hugo's language course, a characteristic foresight. © Contributors 2013.

We conducted an experiment with modern stone knappers with different skill levels and systematically analyzed not only the products of flaking (i.e., detached flakes) but also the intentions prior to flaking, as well as the actions taken to control the shape of a flake through direct hard-hammer percussion. Only modern stone knappers with extensive knapping experience proved capable of predicting and controlling the shape of a flake, which indicated the significant difficulty of controlling the shape of flakes. Evidence was found that knowing the consequence of a strike given to a core at hand requires the acute exploration of the properties of the core and hammerstone to comply with the higher-order relationship among potential platform variables, kinetic energy of the hammerstone at impact, and flake dimension that reflects the constraints of conchoidal fracture. We argue that without this ability, controlling the shape of a flake or the organized débitage of flakes observed in some of the Early Stone Age sites may not have been possible. We further suggest that, given the difficulty and the nature of the skill, the evidence of precise control of conchoidal fracture in the Early Stone Age record may be indicative of the recurrence of a learning situation that allows the transmission of the skill, possibly through providing the opportunities for first-hand experience. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Affordances; Behavior; Cognition; Early hominins; Foresight; Knapping; Lithic technology; Technical skills","cognition; hominid; learning; Stone Age; tool use",,,,,"Ambrose, S.H., Paleolithic technology and human evolution (2001) Science, 291, pp. 1748-1753; Arzamarski, R., Isenhower, R.W., Kay, B.A., Turvey, M.T., Michaels, C.F., Effects of intention and learning on attention to information in dynamic touch (2010) Atten.

Research Question/Issue: Why did the majority of directors prior to the financial crisis not have the foresight to predict the problems of taking on too much risk? We analyze whether executives' characteristics affect strategic choices due to bounded rationality, as proposed by the theory of upper echelons. The literature has thus far not empirically opened this black box. Relying on psychological economics, we develop hypotheses under which conditions expertise and gender can lead to biased information-processing. Research Findings/Insights: To test the hypotheses, we propose a two-study methodology and take the financial crisis as a natural experimental setting. In Study 1, we analyze individual phenomena and show that under conditions of uncertainty, the processing of information by financial experts and men is worse than by non-financial experts and women. In Study 2, we test these findings for organizational phenomena. We show that banks with a higher percentage of financial experts within TMTs perform better in stable environments, but are more negatively affected by the financial crisis. Theoretical/Academic Implications: An important moderator within the theory of upper echelons is financial market discipline during turbulent periods, explaining why the performance of homogenous TMTs is volatile and why the performance of diverse TMTs is sustainable. The theory can be strengthened by including the insights of psychological economics as a micro-foundation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For a sustainable performance, greater TMT diversity in public companies should be instituted by the board of directors. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bounded rationality; Corporate governance; Information processing; Psychological economics; Theory of upper echelons; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Adams, S.M., Flynn, P.M., Local knowledge advances women's access to corporate boards (2005) Corporate Governance: An International Review, 13, pp. 836-846; Arkes, H.R., Dawes, R.M., Christensen, C., Factors influencing the use of a decision rule in a probabilistic task (1986) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 37, pp. 93-110; Baker, W.E., The social structure of a national securities market (1990) American Journal of Sociology, 89, pp. 775-811; Baker, H.K., Nofsinger, J.R., Psychological biases of investors (2002) Financial Services Review, 11, pp. 97-116; Banerjee, A.V., A Simple model of herd behavior (1992) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107, pp. 797-817; Bantel, K.A., Strategic clarity in banking - Role of top management-team demography (1993) Psychological Reports, 73, pp. 1187-1201; Bantel, K.A., Top team, environment, and performance effects on strategic-planning formality (1993) Group & Organization Management, 18, pp. 436-458; Bantel, K.A., Jackson, S.E., Top management and innovations in banking - Does the composition of the top team make a difference (1989) Strategic Management Journal, 10, pp. 107-124; Barber, B.M., Odean, T., Boys will be boys: Gender, overconfidence, and common stock investment (2001) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116, pp. 261-292; Barnes, T.R., Bolliger, L., Cepeda, A., Sykes, D., Expanding diversity in the boardroom (2007) The Corporate Governance Advisor, 15, pp. 1-4; Bar-Yosef, S., Venezia, I., An experimental study of overconfidence in accounting numbers predictions (2006), Hebrew University Working Paper; Basov, S., Blanckenberg, L., Gangadharan, L., Behavioural anomalies, bounded rationality and simple heuristics (2007), University of Melbourne, Research Paper 1012; Baumann, A.O., Deber, R.B., Thompson, G.G., Overconfidence among physicians and nurses: the micro-certainty, macro-uncertainty phenomenon (1991) Social Science & Medicine, 32, pp. 167-174; Beckmann, D., Menkhoff, L., Will women be women?

One of the most serious challenges is how information on the small displays is presented optimally. This paper addresses the special problem of the increasing number of aged users. On the one hand, information displayed should be easily readable. This requires a low information density and a sufficiently large font size. On the other hand menu orientation is facilitated when the amount of information per screen is maximized and a large preview is allowed. This requires presenting as many functions as possible on the screen at a time. Thus, the tradeoff between readability and orientation demands is crucial. In the present study, this tradeoff was experimentally investigated. Two factors, font size (8. pt, 12. pt) and the size of the preview (one or five functions per screen at a time) were varied and effects on navigation performance were observed. Forty older participants solved nine common phone navigation tasks twice consecutively on a simulated mobile phone. Both factors contributed to performance, but there was a significant interaction: navigation performance was optimal when font size and the size of the preview were large. The lowest performance was obtained when the preview was small and the font size large, showing that proper orientation is more important than visibility demands. The results can be used in ergonomic guidelines to optimized information presentation on small screens. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Font size; Information design; Navigation performance; Older adults; Preview; Small-screen device","Navigation; Telephone sets; Font size; Information design; Navigation performance; Older adults; Preview; Small screen devices; Economic and social effects; adult; aged; article; computer interface; controlled study; ergonomics; female; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; male; mobile phone; normal human; simulation; visibility",,,,,"Armbrüster, C., Ziefle, M., Sutter, C., Notebook input devices put to an age test: the usability of trackpoint and touchpad for users over 40 years of age (2007) Ergonomics, 50 (3), pp. 426-445; Arning, K., Ziefle, M., Cognitive and personal predictors for PDA navigation performance (2009) Behav.

Alan Kay1 It is obvious that there are patterns of cultural changeevolution in the neutral senseand any theory of cultural change worth more than a moment's consideration will have to be Darwinian in the minimal sense of being consistent with the theory of evolution by natural selection of Homo sapiens. Daniel Dennett2 The future is here. It's just not widely distributed yet. William Gibson3 It is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases. Charles Darwin commenting on the power of artificial selection4 This article introduces an applied Theory of Evolution of Artificial Systems, called Directed Evolution (DE). The theory is grounded in fifty years of research on Inventive Engineering known as TRIZ, which started in the former Soviet Union by G. Altshuller and continues today. The theory has generated a set of Patterns and Lines of Evolution that represent a compilation of trends that document strong, historically recurring tendencies in the development of manmade systems in general and technological systems in particular. Directed Evolution is the systematic applied-oriented process for predicting future generations of a system by inventing them along these evolutionary patterns. The current article introduces the theory, reflects on its basic underlying logic, and provides a broad historical context and intellectual justification for such an effort. It shows that the quest of DE theory and practice falls well within the boundaries of past pursuits to identify evolutionary patterns of complex systems and to use these patterns to control and manipulate possible futures of artificial systems.

However, an Associated Press article recently suggested that the Norwegian health care system had ""found the Solution to Killer Superbug"". Furthermore, Norway was proclaimed ""The Most Infection Free Country in the World"". What my be the reality behind such headlines, and how shall we as a nation maintain a favourable situation? Physicians in Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands have a long tradition for modest prescription of antibiotics, and are trained to use agents with a narrow antimicrobial spectre whenever possible. This is probably the main reason why these countries have had less antibiotic resistance than others. The number of antibiotics marketed in a country correlates positively with total drug consumption. Until 1992, Norwegian authorities could reject marketing of new compounds if national experts found no medical need for them. The foresight of senior colleagues has led to the number of marketed antibiotics in Norway, even today, being 10-fold lower than in some other European countries. The national surveillance programme, NORM, reports antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens on an annual basis. For example, national levels of MRSA and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are still very low whereas ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E coli and high- level gentamicin resistance in enterococci cause some concern. Norway has well-established epidemiological surveillance systems in the fields of microbiology and infectious diseases. Nevertheless, more knowledge is needed on how antibiotics are used in hospitals. Two national strategic plans (since 2003) have emphasized the explicit importance of antibiotic surveillance to counteract future antibiotic resistance problems. To fulfil national ambitions, there is an urgent need for economic grants to this field; the human resources are there and as eager to start as Olympic performers!",,"antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; article; clinical practice; drug utilization; human; infection control; Norway; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Drug Utilization; Humans; Infection Control; Norway; Physician's Practice Patterns",,"Anti-Bacterial Agents",,,,"Haug, J.B.email: jon.haug@akersykehus.no",,,,,,,,08077096,,,"20706311","Norwegian","Tidsskr.

Technological foresights have indicated that the next generation of service robots will demonstrate a high degree of autonomy and reliability, have minimal impact on the environment, and will interact in a flexible way with the user. It is necessary therefore, to determine the functional requirements for a future energy-efficient robotic bioproduction system from the perspective of various stakeholders, together with the development of a high-level framework for designing and prototyping the common functionalities of mobile robots. This study presents technical guidelines for the design of a plant nursing robot. The methodology uses Quality Function Deployment (QFD) functionalities involving the identification of relationships between identified user requirements and the derived design parameters. Extracted important user requirements included: 1) adjustable to row distance and parcel size, 2) profitable, 3) minimize damage to crops, and 4) reliable. Lower ratings were attributed to requirements such as: 1) affection value, prestige, 2) look attractive, 3) out of season operations, and 4) use of renewable energy. Subsequent important derived design parameters included: 1) PreparedForModularTools, 2) ControlableByExternalModules, 3) SemiAutonomous, and 4) Local- and GlobalPositioningSystem. The least important design parameters included: 1) OpenStandardSoftware, 2) Well-builtAppearance, 3) WheelsWithInfiniteSteeringRotation, and 4) InternalSafetySystem. The study demonstrates the feasibility of applying a systematic design technique and procedures for translating the 'consumer's voice' into the design and technical specifications of a robotic tool carrier to be used in bioproduction. © 2009 IAgrE.",,"A plants; Bio-production; Degree of autonomy; Design guidelines; Design parameters; Energy efficient; Functional requirement; Impact on the environment; Prototyping; Renewable energies; Robotic tools; Row distance; Service robots; Systematic design techniques; Technical guidelines; Technical specifications; User requirements; User-centric; Large scale systems; Mobile robots; Nursing; Profitability; Quality function deployment; Renewable energy resources; Robotics; Wireless telecommunication systems; Machine design",,,,,"Akao, Y., (1990) Quality Function Deployment: Integrating Customer Requirements into Product Design, , Productivity Press, Cambridge, MA; Akao, Y., Mazur, G.H., The leading edge in QFD: past, present and future (2003) International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 20 (1), pp. 20-35; Bhattacharya, A., Sarkar, B., Mukherjee, S.K., Integrating AHP with QFD for robot selection under requirement perspective (2005) International Journal of Production Research, 43, pp. 3671-3685; Chan, L.K., Wu, M.L., A systematic approach to quality function deployment with a full illustrative example (2005) Omega, 33, pp. 119-139; Chen, C.Y., Chen, L.C., Lin, L., Methods for processing and prioritizing customer demands in variant product design (2004) IIE Transactions, 36, pp. 203-219; Cohen, L., (1995) Quality Function Deployment: How to Make QFD Work for You, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Christensen, S., Søgaard, H.T., Kudsk, P., Nørremark, M., Lund, I., Nadimi, E.S., Jørgensen, R., Site-specific weed control technologies (2009) Weed Research, 49, pp. 233-241; Crowe, T.J., Cheng, C.C., Using quality function deployment in manufacturing strategic planning (1996) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 16, p. 35; Dalgaard, T., Halberg, N., Porter, J.R., A model for fossil energy use in Danish agriculture used to compare organic and conventional farming (2001) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 87 (1), pp. 51-65; Dario, P., Dillman, R., Christensen, H.I., EURON Research Roadmaps (2004) Robotics: European Research, , Agenda; Griffin, A., Hauser, J.R., The voice of the customer (1993) Marketing Science, 12 (1), pp. 1-27; Haghiac, H.A., Haque, I., Quality function deployment as a tool for including customer preferences in optimising vehicle dynamic behaviour (2005) International Journal of Vehicle Design, 39, pp. 311-330; Hamza, M.A., Anderson, W.K., Soil compaction in cropping systems a review of the nature, causes and possible solutions (2005) Soil and Tillage Research, 82 (2), pp. 121-145. , June 2005; Visioner for fremtidens jordbrug.

The birth of Cooperative Education as an important part of the education of engineers was the brainchild of Herman Schneider. His foresight in realizing that in order to fully understand what engineering was about required an immersion in the real technical world came at a time when more and more individuals were able to experience an educational system that had been relatively limited to upper class society. Suddenly there was a push to open up the doors of academia to individuals who might actually work in professions and require help in paying for that education by working professionally before they graduated. Family money, unavailable, gave way to technical jobs that could support the student's educational costs. This gave way to a new but fully realized concept that contact between what man thought and studied with how he acted in the real world was beneficial and critical for learning to take place. What you studied and how you used that learning was critical for education. Cooperative Education, Internships, and Experiential Learning, as important as they are, have been confined to students in college and more recently to students in high school in varying degrees. Institutions across the country have offered the various work-related areas to their students as suggested endeavors or as required activities. There has not been a national consensus to require students, especially in engineering, to gain work-related experience before they graduate. The premise of this paper is that professionals in the Cooperative Education, Internships, and Experiential Learning areas; academic administrators; government leaders; faculty; students; and parents should concentrate on a new area of focus. This focus should not be whether students need to combine the learning they gain in the classroom with the education that they gain on the job but on the other hand when that collaboration takes place. High school and college experience is like the old proverbial phrase that says that it is ridiculous to ""lock the barn door after the horse has bolted."" At the end of their formal educational careers we tell students that it is important to get work experience. Perhaps that is why we do not have 100% participation. Many have bolted by then to menial jobs close to home or nothing jobs just to pay for a few college expenses. This is why When is so important. This paper argues that we should focus our attention on dealing directly with K-12 educators and parents, especially those with children in the very early years of education, and start to formulate a concentrated plan that deals with the education of the young in all things related to the work that they will do in their later lives. The synthesis of academic learning and the work done outside the classroom and its immense value needs to be exploited. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.",,"Apprentices; Education; Engineering education; Teaching; Academic administrators; Cooperative education; Educational career; Educational systems; Experiential learning; Government leaders; National consensus; Work experience; Students",,,,,"http://www.yousaytoo.com/littleprince/start-teaching-your-children-at-an- early-age/22211; http://www.ehow.com/how_5039832_teach-become-organized-early-age.html; http://www.kidsource.com/kidsource/content2/learning.html","Gunn, C.; Michigan State UniversityUnited States",,"","American Society for Engineering Education","2010 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition","20 June 2010 through 23 June 2010","Louisville, KY",81438,21535965,,,,"English","ASEE Annu.
