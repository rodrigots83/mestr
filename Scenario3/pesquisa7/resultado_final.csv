The paper offers the outcomes of the foresight study of the Russian renewable energy sector and focuses on three areas: converting solar energy into electricity; converting wind energy into electricity; and converting biomass into thermal energy and electricity. The goal of the study was to foresee and agree on the visionary future for the nascent renewable energy sector in the country, as well as to provide the scientifically justified grounds for government and corporate decision-makers. The research is based on a mixture of methods: bibliometric analysis and text mining, literature review, expert surveys and interviews, workshops, STEEPV analysis of trends, scenario analysis, and applied policy analysis. As a result of the study, major trends and uncertainties that may affect the Russian and global renewable energy sector in the next 15–20 years were identified. Other results include the scenarios for Russia's renewable energy sector that are proposed together with recommendations for the Russian companies and public authorities. The study's policy and market implications go beyond Russia: the outcomes may be useful for similar studies, early stage renewable energy policy planning and investment decision. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd";"Biomass energy; Energy policy; Foresight; Solar energy; Wind energy";"Proskuryakova, L.N.; National Research University Higher School of Economics, Russian Federation, 11 Myasnitskaya St., Russian Federation; email: lproskuryakova@hse.ru";Elsevier Ltd;9601481;;;;English;Renew.

We use the overlapping-generation model of Grandmont (1985), which displays multiple perfect-foresight equilibria, including periodic and chaotic dynamics. The equilibrium selection problem is not solved under learning, as each outcome is predicted by at least one existing learning theory. We find that subjects in the lab systematically coordinate on an equilibrium despite the complexity of the environment. Coordination only happens on simple equilibria, in this case the steady state or the period-two cycle, a result which is predicted only if the subjects follow simple learning rules. This suggests that relevant perfect-foresight equilibria should be robust to the use of simple rules. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;"Complex dynamics; Equilibrium selection; Laboratory experiments; Learning";"Salle, I.; Bank of CanadaCanada; email: ISalle@bank-banque-canada.ca";Academic Press Inc.;220531;;JECTA;;English;J.

Particularly in the context of vehicle autonomy, customer insights lay a significant foundation for strategic decision-making of organizations in the automotive industry. This paper outlines how a German car manufacturer explored customer needs in the context of highly automated vehicles (AVs). 1 by implementing corporate foresight research with visionary customers and how the findings supported the strategic decision-making process of the firm. A qualitative pilot study with 29 visionary, trend-receiving customers from Germany, the USA and China identified three innovative use cases for premium highly AVs. A subsequent quantitative online survey with 733 participants from the same three markets confirms the relevance of the use cases for mainstream and innovative consumers. The findings underline that highly AVs are a game changer, transforming future cars into extended living and office spaces, with several implications for practitioners. The findings helped to adapt the organization's business model and branding strategy, provided valuable insights for follow-up studies and shaped corporate communication. The contribution of the paper is threefold: It introduces the concept of strategic customer foresight, outlines specifically how organizations can implement customer foresight research as well as how such research benefits the decision-making process of companies. Further, the paper discloses future customer needs in the context of premium highly AVs. © 2019;"Autonomous driving; Corporate foresight; Customer foresight; Customer insights; Emergent nature consumers; Qualitative research; Radical innovation; Survey; Trend receiver";"Schweitzer, N.; Institute for Customer Insight, University of St. Gallen, Bahnhofstrasse 8, Switzerland; email: nicola.schweitzer@unisg.ch";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

However, this approach does not take into account numerous factors of change or disruption over a longer term (10 to 20, or even 50 years), although a decade or two are needed to effectively deal with the stakes of research. These stakes become more acute over the long term, as consequences of predicted changes (e. g. climate) or other factors such as pollution, biodiversity erosion, reduction of ecosystemic services... This complex question justifies turning to a foresight approach. Because it enables tipping points to be envisaged for some key variables of the system studied (in this case, the environment), the scenario method seems well adapted to proposing several contrasting visions of the future. The research question is: how a large screening of international studies on environmental scenarios can help framing the reflection on research priorities about environment? To help take its strategic reflection forward, in June 2015 the French national research alliance for the environment (AllEnvi) commissioned its transversal foresight group to identify the major families of scenarios described in foresight studies dealing with the environment since 2000. The summary of the 307 scenarios produced by analyzing 99 international studies highlighted 11 possible societal and environmental pathways. Analyzing these families of scenarios thus makes it easier to clarify the multiple roles that science can play, according to contrasting dynamics. Consequently, this study shows how a systematic review of foresight studies and their related visions of the future of environment can stimulate and enlighten the reflection on the ways societies can (re)define their future, by combining environmental, governance and social sciences.. © 2019;"2100; Environment; Foresight; Research programming; Scenarios";"Lacroix, D.Ifremer Av.

First, it presents the methodology including ten characteristics for scenario assessment: modelling framework (diversity), ambitiousness of the targets 2050, relations with other (European)countries, stakeholder involvement, technology options, non-technological aspects, economic component, usage of scenarios in policy design, intermediate indicators of targets' achievement and revision of scenarios. Further, it uses qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate energy scenarios developed in six north-west European countries (the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark, the UK, Belgium). Finally, conclusions are made concerning the possible ways of scenario design improvement. The analysis has shown that all selected countries have potential for modifying their energy scenarios, which being implemented may help to achieve the joint European targets 2050. Since these countries are socially and economically interrelated, a more harmonised approach to scenario development is needed to be designed and introduced on the EU level. Ten characteristics proposed in this study may serve as an initial input for such harmonisation. The results can be of interest to economists, business and academic representatives, and especially policy makers involved in the long-term energy scenario development on the international, regional and national level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Energy policy; Foresight; Low-carbon energy scenarios; North-west European countries; Technology trends; The European targets 2050";"Mikova, N.; National Research University Higher School of Economics, Myasnitskaya st. 20, Russian Federation; email: nmikova@hse.ru";Elsevier Ltd;3014215;;ENPYA;;English;Energy Policy;2-s2.0-85065159226;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition to methods for producing foresight knowledge, tools are needed to make sense of the increasing amounts of future-oriented argumentation. This article presents a comparative analysis of anticipatory argumentation in two fields: the EU data protection reform and the Finnish concept for comprehensive security. A three-layer heuristic framework is presented for qualitative analysis of statements on plausible futures. The first layer consists of specific expectations regarding the future. The second layer is the generic anticipatory storyline. The third layer consists of the underlying futures consciousness. The data protection case presents an institutional reform narrative with short time perspective and relatively high agency, while the comprehensive security case presents a crisis narrative based on a contingency planning orientation with long time perspective, relatively developed systems perception and relatively low agency. In policy foresight with high uncertainty and high aspirations of agency, reflexivity and ethical responsibility are crucial components of foresight. This article promotes these by providing a tool for structuring anticipatory assumptions. The tool can be used for studying policy documents or during the policy process to craft more rigorous future-oriented policies. © 2019 The Author;"Anticipation; Comprehensive security; Data protection; Future orientation; Futures consciousness; Reflexivity";;Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

A novel approach to simulate a time-adaptive intra-day photovoltaic forecast, solely based on an exponential smoothing of deviations between realized and forecast values, is presented. Generation uncertainty is then incorporated by numerous multi-stage scenario trees that account for a decreasing forecast error over time. Results show that total system costs significantly increase when uncertainty of both wind and photovoltaic generation is included by a single forecast, with more frequent starting processes of flexible plants and rather inflexible power plants mainly deployed at part-load. Including the improvement of both wind and photovoltaic forecasts by a scenario tree of possible manifestations, the scheduling costs could be significantly reduced in representative weeks for spring and summer. In general, stochastic representations increase the need for congestion management as well as more frequent use of storage in the model, leading to a more realistic depiction of the markets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity system modeling; Flexibility; Forecast error simulation; Photovoltaic; Stochasticity; Unit commitment";"Weibezahn, J.; Technische Universität Berlin, Workgroup for Infrastructure Policy (WIP), Straße des 17.

Design/methodology/approach: Using horizon scanning, scenario analysis and expert opinion, nine capabilities are identified as core areas to be developed to support the country’s future growth of product-service systems. Findings: The results of a Delphi survey involving 30 industry and academic thought leaders recommend priorities of these capabilities. This paper concludes with a discussion of the study implications for theory, research and practice in the domain of servitisation and product-service systems. Research limitations/implications: The foresight study presented here on the future of servitisation in Singapore demonstrates one of the first fully fledged applications of foresight in constructing a coherent vision of future product-service system markets. In this study, the authors applied systemic foresight methodology (SFM) comprising the first six phases: initiation (scoping), intelligence (scanning), imagination (scenarios), integration (priorities), interpretation (strategies) and implementation (action).For future research, an ideal step would be to proceed with the final phase of the SFM, impact, to develop indicators for servitisation and to monitor and evaluate the transition process. Practical implications: Manufacturing and services are no longer distinct concepts with a clear divide. Manufacturing firms not only become more service dependent but also produce and provide services for their consumers. This transformation towards servitisation implies fundamental re-organisation of the production and management practices. Furthermore, through new business models, new and loyal customers will be gained, which will in turn bring additional income, while making the companies less prone to economic and business fluctuations. Social implications: The results of this study have practical implications for policymakers of public and private sectors that are interested in playing a key role in future product-service system innovation. These have implications for developing the human and intellectual capital that are required for supporting the future innovation. Institutes of higher learning and vocational institutes should also consider incorporating new curricula and modules to build the capabilities for knowledge creation and transfer. Originality/value: The findings of the present study on strategic growth areas and relevant critical capabilities provide new directions for research in the field of servitisation. Among the nine capabilities identified, the top three were advanced customer intelligence capability, socio-physical service quality, traceability and maintainability and integrated strategic decision-making. From the results, it is apparent that advanced customer intelligence capability is both an area of importance to Singapore and the world. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Singapore; Transition";"Cheah, S.L.-Y.; Department of Management and Organization, National University of SingaporeSingapore; email: sarahcheah@nus.edu.sg";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85062018039;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A foresight program can help organizations map the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies and serve as a valuable input to organizational strategic planning. IRI and RTI International developed a foresight program for intelligent systems to guide companies in framing, exploring, envisioning, and acting on the impacts intelligent systems may have. Working from an intelligent systems research framework, the program identified 70 key drivers of change and developed three scenarios depicting plausible and thought-provoking visions of the future of intelligent systems.

The authors, who are leading researchers at the Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, reveal discrepancies between a series of provisions in the document and the current level of Russia’s economic development, primarily in science and technology. The document provides virtually no economic rationale or analysis of what causes the loss of science and technology potential in Russia. The attempt to foresee the technological development of individual Russian regions is unsuccessful. The general conclusion is that the foresight document does not provide a single platform for the development and implementation of strategic planning documents in the field of science and technology. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.;;"Kryukov, V.A.; Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of SciencesRussian Federation; email: nsus@academ.org";Pleiades Publishing;10757007;;;;English;Stud.

The benefits are clear when the contract water quantity can be guaranteed by the seller. Where water right allocations are subject to interannual variability, guaranteed delivery may not be feasible. Skillful season-ahead forecasts of water right allocations and crop market prices have the potential to inform option contracts in such circumstances. Here, two theoretical growers' cooperatives, representing high-value and low-value cropping within a basin, are modeled as exclusive water-trading partners. A two-firm demand equilibrium model is developed from a coupled crop yield and economic model, conditioned on each cooperative's production inputs. Subsequently, several combinations of single-stage and multistage season-ahead forecasts of allocations and crop prices inform both the demand and an option contract model. Evaluating combinations of forecast and persistence-informed models against a perfect foresight-informed model, both the efficacy of the forecast-informed option contract framework and the value of forecast information are determined. Results indicate combinations including multistage season-ahead forecasts of allocations produce results that most closely represent expected trade volume, direction of trading, and market-scale joint profitability across a range of intercooperative water rights ownership scenarios. The multistage allocation forecasts exert more influence over option contract utility than forecasts of product market prices. This work highlights the value of forecast-informed decision making as it pertains to promoting market-scale economic and water use efficiency. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.;;"Delorit, J.D.; Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of Wisconsin-MadisonUnited States; email: delorit@wisc.edu";American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE);7339496;;;;English;J.

The paper investigates technological prospects of priorities implementation indicated in the 'Strategy for the Scientific and Technological Development of the Russian Federation'. More precisely, we examine the advanced digital and intelligent production technologies deployment by applying foresight methods and new solutions such as an advanced text-mining. The main goal of the study is to define a range of the most promising technologies with respect to markets and products within the priority. We identified five large cross-cutting areas manifesting physical and digital convergence. These clusters include computer modelling and flexible manufacturing systems from the production side, and sensor technologies, virtual/augmented reality, the Internet of Things from the IT side. The revealed technological trends correspond to global patterns and unveil a range of sectoral applications. Product development technologies are confessed to be the core of digital manufacturing. During the analysis we uncovered 350 prospective products and services that should be exposed to further expert evaluation. Our results offer a new insight on science and technology policy-making by adjusting technology development across industries. A suggested framework allows expanding current boundaries of forecasting activities at the national level in order to boost Russian scientific performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.;;;Institute of Physics Publishing;17578981;;;;English;IOP Conf.

When the comparison is feasible, therefore, there is large opportunity for learning and methodological refinement. The authors of this study had the opportunity to re-examine the findings of a technology foresight exercise on the medical device industry with realized technological performance, five years later. Among the findings of the comparison exercise, intriguing false positive as well as false negative cases have been identified. The paper suggests that these cases are due to specific cognitive and motivational biases of experts and examines the way in which they are at work in the foresight process. It argues that these biases are due to the inability of experts to reason systematically in abstract (or “functional”) terms during the whole foresight process. It also suggests a methodology to mitigate the biases and to manage the emergence of false positives and false negatives. © 2018;"Abstract reasoning; Cognitive biases; Expert forecast; Failure mode analysis; Functional analysis; Medical device industry";"Bonaccorsi, A.; School of Engineering, University of Pisa, Largo Lucio Lazzarino 2, Italy; email: andrea.bonaccorsi@unipi.it";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

This paper aims to review reasons to believe computation will continue to become faster in the future, the economic consequences of speedups and how these affect risk, ethics and governance. Design/methodology/approach: A brief review of science and trends followed by an analysis of consequences. Findings: Current computation is far from the physical limits in terms of processing speed. Algorithmic improvements may be equally powerful but cannot easily be predicted or bounded. Communication and sensing is already at the physical speed limits, although improvements in bandwidth will likely be significant. The value in these speedups lies in productivity gains, timeliness, early arrival of results and cybernetic feedback shifts. However, time compression can lead to loss of control owing to inability to track fast change, emergent or systemic risk and asynchrony. Speedups can also exacerbate inequalities between different agents and reduce safety if there are competitive pressures. Fast decisions are potentially not better decisions, as they may be made on little data. Social implications: The impact on society and the challenge to governance are likely to be profound, requiring adapting new methods for managing fast-moving and technological risks. Originality/value: The speed with which events happen is an important aspect of foresight, not just as a subject of prediction or analysis, but also as a driver of the kinds of dynamics that are possible. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Ethics;"Sandberg, A.; Future of Humanity Institute, Faculty of Philosophy, University of OxfordUnited Kingdom; email: anders.sandberg@philosophy.ox.ac.uk";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85055968015;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Firstly, we underline that KM is approaching a stage of maturity that requires continuing efforts to use theoretical and empirical investigation to question its future evolution, through a foresight reflection. In parallel, we show that the link between knowledge management and foresight is of long-standing concern. In the context of a knowledge-based economy, this connection has taken on a structuring dimension. Thus, the purpose of this TFSC special issue is two-fold. On the one hand, we seek to explore the impacts of foresight on knowledge management and to understand its cognitive dimensions. And, on the other hand, we cast a future-oriented eye on knowledge management both as a set of practices and a research field.

Challenges and complexities have doubled. Social media and big data have been in fore front in cruising business direction and pathways. SMEs also face the dilemma of budget, digitalization, strategic plan, growth etc. How SME’s will harness customer engagement technology with limited resources and capacity constraints.

In the effectual process, entrepreneurs reject any attempt to predict or forecast the future which would allow them to define their new ventures. Instead, they concentrate on building the future through their action and interaction with the different actors in their environment. The same attitude towards the future can be found in the literature on foresight. However, until now, these two concepts have not been brought together. The proposed paper is based on an exploratory study. Through a review of the literature on both effectuation and foresight, we aim to shed some light on the implicit links between the two concepts: cognition and networks. In addition, through a series of semi-conducted interviews with both entrepreneurs and some leading figures from the field of foresight, we explore this relationship more deeply. The results from the interviews suggest new approaches that could further strengthen the relationship between effectuation and foresight. This study opens a number of new perspectives for building foresight approaches that would be more adapted for entrepreneurs, notably in the initial stages of the development of their projects, as well as some possibilities for possible future research developments. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;"Cognition; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship; Foresight; Networks";"Djuricic, K.; EM Strasbourg Business School, University of Strasbourg, HuManiS EA 7308, 61 Avenue de la Forêt Noire, France; email: ksenija.djuricic@em-strasbourg.eu";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Building on the Ricoeurian notion of distentio- ‘the stretching of consciousness through simultaneous attention to memory and expectation’, we develop the concept of distentive capability as a spatio-temporal process of ‘way-finding’ that sustains the creative emergence of strategic foresight across multiple time horizons. Emphasizing narratives as the site of strategic foresight, we draw on tropes taken from three of the most popular speeches delivered by Steve Jobs, the American information technology entrepreneur, inventor and founder of Apple Inc. to illustrate how distentive capability as played out in the reassembling of the past, the present and the future, stretched out in time, may contribute to the identification of potentialities and limits for strategic action.

The analysis is based on around forty foresight projects conducted by the CNAM community of practice in the last ten years or so, based on the typology proposed by Bootz (2003) and Bootz and Monti (2008). The aim is twofold: first, we test the robustness of the initial typology and, second, we examine global developments in foresight practices through an analysis of their cognitive aspects. The examination of present practice led to the typology being refined, and demonstrates how its impact on organizational learning has been extended. It also shows how discussion has evolved through networks that are more open to the outside world and closer to action, with measures and tools adopted to promote greater flexibility. These changes may be partially explained by the emergence of the knowledge economy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight; Knowledge management; Organizational learning";"Bootz, J.-P.; EM Strasbourg Business School, Université de Strasbourg, HuManiS EA 7308, 61 Avenue de la Forêt Noire, France; email: bootzjp@yahoo.fr";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In value-laden areas such as public health and healthcare, deliberative scenario methods are clearly needed. For the sixth Dutch Public Health Status and Forecasts-report (PHSF-2014), a new approach of co-creation was developed aiming to incorporate different societal norms and values in the description of possible future developments. The major future trends in the Netherlands were used as a starting point for a deliberative dialogue with stakeholders to identify the most important societal challenges for public health and healthcare. Four societal challenges were identified: 1) To keep people healthy as long as possible and cure illness promptly, 2) To support vulnerable people and enable social participation, 3) To promote individual autonomy and freedom of choice, and 4) To keep health care affordable. Working with stakeholders, we expanded these societal challenges into four corresponding normative scenarios. In a survey the normative scenarios were found to be recognizable and sufficiently distinctive. We organized meetings with experts to explore how engagement and policy strategies in each scenario would affect the other three societal challenges. Possible synergies and trade-offs between the four scenarios were identified. Public health foresight based on a business-as-usual scenario and normative scenarios is clearly practicable. The process and the outcomes support and elucidate a wide range of strategic discussions in public health. © 2018 The Authors;"Foresight; Normative scenarios; Population health; Public health; Public involvement; The Netherlands";"Schoemaker, C.G.; National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), PO Box 1, Netherlands; email: casper.schoemaker@rivm.nl";Elsevier Ireland Ltd;1688510;;HEPOE;30424887;English;Health Policy;2-s2.0-85056413912;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We assume control is distributed between a global controller (GC) and local controllers (LCs) located at the nodes with storage units. Each LC has access to its most recent net load data and runs at every time step while the GC has delayed data due to smart meter infrastructure or communication network delay, hence runs less frequently. We describe three control schemes: 1) direct storage controller (DSC) in which the GC computes the storage control signals for an upcoming window and the LCs directly use these signals; 2) net load following controller (NLFC) in which the GC computes a net load profile for each node and each LC tries to track its set profile; and 3) nodal slack controller (NSC) in which the GC computes upper and lower bounds on the net load at each node and the LC optimizes the local control action constrained by these bounds. We use a radial network with real load data to compare the performance of these schemes based on arbitrage profit and maximum solar penetration relative to a perfect foresight controller. We find that NSC and NLFC increase the supported maximum solar penetration to 29% and 40%, respectively, as compared to 10% for DSC. Moreover, NSC is able to capture 90.7% of the available arbitrage profits which is significantly higher than that achievable with NLFC and DSC. © 2017 IEEE";"Control systems; Distributed generation; Energy storage";"Rajagopal, R.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford UniversityUnited States; email: ram.rajagopal@stanford.edu";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;19493053;;;;English;IEEE Trans.

This problem is not only hindering the progress of Taiwan's sustainable energy policy but also preventing the energy companies from setting competitive business strategies. This study investigates the key factors affecting the strategy planning for Taiwan's HE development, through a proposed technology foresight based research framework that extends from the introduction of Trends, Uncertainty factors to that of sketching Strategies (named TUS). The TUS inducts literature and specialist's expertise to perform data divergence, information convergence, and factors analysis with the use of Delphi and Theoretical Triangulation. The study result concludes eight key trends, seven key uncertainty factors, and sets six strategies for Taiwan. Furthermore, the demonstrated TUS practice and research findings provide considerable reference beneficial to the extension of future studies associated with HE. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC;"Hydrogen economy; Key factor; Strategy planning; Technology foresight; Theoretical triangulation";"Chen, Y.-T.; Department of Information Management, National United UniversityTaiwan; email: yutso.chen@nuu.edu.tw";Elsevier Ltd;3603199;;IJHED;;English;Int J Hydrogen Energy;2-s2.0-85051743544;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since we integrate online communities as information sources in our foresight process, we call this ‘open foresight’. This open foresight process focuses upon the topic ‘Aviation 2040’ and is executed with aviation experts and an online community in two steps. This research setting enabled us to show (1) differences and similarities in future assessments and foresight capabilities between experts and online communities and (2) how to efficiently integrate online communities into foresight processes. Combining insights from experts and community members and, in doing so, moving towards ‘Open Radar Groups’ seems to be a beneficial way for conducting foresight and enriching companies’ knowledge base. © 2018 The Authors;"Aviation; Delphi study; Focus group; Netnography; Online community; Open foresight";"Zeng, M.A.; Technology and Innovation Management, Helmut-Schmidt-University, Holstenhofweg 85, Germany; email: michael.zeng@hsu-hh.de";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

While techniques such as business wargaming can effectively support this process, such techniques can benefit from placing competitive considerations within a broader future landscape shaped by geopolitical, social, technological and economic forces. Scenario planning allows for the exploration of interactions across multiple external forces to create a rich set of narratives on how the future may unfold. This paper will discuss the potential of combining scenario planning and business wargaming to enable strategists to anticipate moves and countermoves and foresee their consequences. We use a real-life case study to illustrate how a scenario-planning exercise can guide the crucial stage of selecting relevant future competitors of a firm prior to engaging in a business-war-gaming exercise. We then introduce what we term the prospective competitive strategy process to guide the analysis of potential competitive dynamics, emphasizing the synergies between scenario planning and business wargaming. © 2018 The Authors;"Business war gaming; Competitive landscape; Foresight; Scenario planning";"Rohrbeck, R.; Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University, Department of Management, Fuglesangs Alle 4, Denmark; email: rrohr@mgmt.au.dk";Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-85054751922;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The aim is to identify, examine, and place in a hierarchical structure, based on a two-step exploratory methodology, the motivators for IT adoption of four main categories of healthcare stakeholders (employees, patients, UAE citizens and residents, and accredited foresight experts) via an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model. AHP revealed the relative importance weights of the seven IT adoption motivators and their 41 sub-motivators. Government support was found to be the most important group of motivators, followed by knowledge sharing, infrastructure, green management, lean management, internal/external environment, and social sustainability. The paper facilitates improving technology adoption generally, specifically in the UAE’s healthcare system. A Pareto chart visually presents the ranking of all sub-factors to help supply-chain practitioners better allocate resources for IT implementation. Little research has examined the combined perspectives of various stakeholders and no study has hitherto investigated the significant motivators of IT adoption in the UAEs’ healthcare industry.

The confluence of machine learning advances, accelerated growth in acquired data, on-demand CPU and GPU driven computing such as cloud infrastructure, and other advances in automation and robotics are causing an industrial revolution that some term as the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"". Given that all these transformative technologies are now available and rapidly reinventing other industries, why is the rate of adoption in the oil and gas industry so slow? How can we best utilize these advances to stop drowning in data and instead transform this data into information and knowledge in order to enable secure and intelligent automation in oilfield operations? The oil and gas industry has attempted, at times successfully, a multitude of big data and analytical techniques to further describe and analyze the systems' or system of systems' subsurface interactions. While the proofs of concepts have shown promise, structural difficulties embedded in the design of 20th century systems hinder the implementation of the methods and procedures now part and parcel of the 21st century, driven forth because of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Unfortunately, 20th century procedures are not able to incorporate 21st century driven processes and methods of conducting business. We outline some of the structural challenges facing the oil and gas industry and describe a few of the solutions that have been developed to help companies in the industry. These include applications from the subsurface in geophysics, completions design, and production. Overcoming data silos in traditional data infrastructure requires a novel approach to cloud infrastructure that respects user access, data privacy, and data residency requirements of companies. Assessing data for quality and for reasonable diversity and variation in order to answer questions posed by oil & gas companies can be quite profound. This critical step prevents companies from spending lots of non-productive time and money trying to develop and tune machine learning algorithms to produce answers that are simply not available in the data. Further, getting data to be in a form suitable to apply artificial intelligence can be quite involved. We illustrate the above challenges by several subsurface examples and then describe the implementation of novel solutions. What we will show is that the oil and gas digital highway presently has data traffic jams preventing it from moving at the speed of light. Removing these traffic jams offers decision-makers the Revolution on the previous one while showcasing the concept of [3] Creative Destruction that supplants one technology with another. According to Joseph Schumpeter, the ""gale of creative destruction"" describes the ""process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one"". The various Industrial Revolutions are described in Figure 1 as: 1. IR 1.0 was steam power and the advent of industrialization 2. IR 2.0 was the introduction of factories, mass manufacturing and other techniques of mass production 3. IR 3.0 was the semiconductor revolution with advances in computers, electronics and robotics/ automation 4. IR4.0 is about cyberphysical systems and the marriage of hardware and software to produce autonomous systems [4] The Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in Figure 2 are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. Independent systems have existed and are continuously moving towards becoming autonomous in nature, for example, the above surface rotating equipment in the oilfield whose health is monitored in real-time and event triggers manage and alleviate catastrophic failures. [5] Artificial Intelligence is realizing the intelligent interoperations of system of systems defined as a collection of task-oriented or dedicated systems that pool their resources and capabilities together to create a new, more complex system which offers more functionality and performance than simply the sum of the constituent systems. Upstream oil and gas has specialized over the last 100 years into highly developed scientific and commercial niches. While the outcome has been engineering and academic disciplines driving forth accuracy in decisions within the disciplines, the integration of the various niches, which can be stated as the intelligent communication of information between and among systems, has remained a struggle. We discuss this further under the section entitled ""Data Management"". It is easy to recognize that where there is high quality communication of information among systems, artificial intelligence has made significant strides. For example, facial recognition is now used routinely for expediting in airports for expediting immigration lines, online retail and companies like Netflix use artificial intelligence to understand customer preferences and refine and target their offerings, personal assistants like Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa, Google Now, and Apple Siri use voice recognition for many applications such as home automation. opportunity to move from insight to foresight - looking out in front instead of the rearview mirror to drive change. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.";;;Society of Petroleum Engineers;;9,78E+12;;;English;Soc.

At any node of a decision tree, the decision maker looks forward a fixed number of stages perfectly. Beyond that, the decision maker aggregates continuation values according to a function that captures reasoning under unpredictability. The model is uniquely identified from the decision maker's preference over decision trees. Confronting a decision tree, the decision maker iteratively revises her plan for the future as she moves forward in the decision tree. A comparative measure of unpredictability aversion and several examples are discussed.

At the same time, territorial cohesion in Europe is challenged by the dominant role of urban areas in territorial development and in territorial development policies. One may conclude that the urban perspective and territorial cohesion cannot do without each other, but at the same time, they risk to wreck each other. This contribution will further explore this complicated relation. Starting with the growing importance of urban areas, the first section will address the increasing concentration of economic and demographic growth in Europe to urban areas (Böhme and Lüer 2017; ESPON 2017, 2018). Based on the idea that cities act as motors for territorial development in a wider region, over the past decades they have become the centre points for development and future perspectives.

Different specifications for the monetary policy rule are analyzed, namely a so-called current, forward, or backward-looking feedback rule, depending on whether the monetary authority uses the actual, expected, or last observed values of the inflation rate to set the monetary policy. We study how the responsiveness of the policy rule with respect to inflation affects the determinacy of the monetary equilibrium. A policy rule is called aggressive (moderate) if it responds strongly (moderately) to inflation deviations from the target. We show how aggressive feedback rules, depending on the considered timing, can reinforce mechanisms that lead to indeterminacy or may lead the inflation rate to fluctuate around the monetary equilibrium at which monetary policy is aggressive. A leaning against the wind policy seems to be more desirable from an equilibrium determinacy point of view. On the contrary, a leaning with the wind policy could not be the recommended policy for the Central Bank. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.;"Indeterminacy; Monetary Policy Rules; OLG Model; Perfect Foresight Equilibrium";"Pecora, N.; Catholic University, Department of Economics and Social Science, Via EmiliaParmense 84, Italy; email: nicolo.pecora@unicatt.it";Cambridge University Press;13651005;;;;English;Macroecon.

For the sake of simplicity, the grid is designed as a single copper plate with island restrictions and constant demand of 1000 MW; the volatile input is deducted from scaled 15-min input data of German grid operators. A mixed integer linear programming model is implemented to generate an optimised unit commitment (UCO) for various scenarios and configurations using CPLEX fi as the problem solver. The resulting unit commitment is input into a non-linear control model (NLC), which tries to match the plan of the UCO as closely as possible. Using the approach of a rolling horizon the result of the NLC is fed back to the interval of the next optimisation run. The problem’s objective is set to minimise CO 2 emissions of the whole electricity producer park. Different interval lengths are tested with perfect foresight. The results gained with different interval lengths are compared to each other and to a simple heuristic approach. As non-linear control model a characteristic line model is used. The results show that the influence of the interval length is rather small, which leads to the conclusion that realistic forecast lengths of two days can be used to achieve not only a sufficient quality of solutions, but shorter computational times as well. © 2019 by the authors.";"Islands; Long-term storage; MILP models; Mixed integer linear programming; Non-linear control; Renewable energies; Rolling horizon; Unit commitment";"Erichsen, G.; Institute of Energy Systems, Hamburg University of Technology, Denickestr. 15, Germany; email: gerrit.erichsen@tuhh.de";MDPI AG;19961073;;;;English;Energies;2-s2.0-85065998750;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Energy storage owners collect revenues from this price variation by performing energy arbitrage. This paper develops a framework to determine the value of energy arbitrage in the real-time and day-ahead markets. A statistical analysis on the historical energy market data of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) reveals higher variations in the real-time prices than the day-ahead making the former more favorable for energy arbitrage. First, the maximum potential revenue from each market is calculated using a linear optimization program assuming a perfect foresight of future prices. In this simulation, the real-time market revenues are twice as high as the day-ahead market. A more realistic assumption is also modeled to incorporate the uncertainties and forecast errors in both markets. Two techniques are proposed to handle the uncertainties: back-casting and normal errors. A dynamic shrinking horizon optimization algorithm is developed to better capture the maximum revenue of energy arbitrage in the real-time market based on the actual participation model of energy storage. Even under large forecast errors in the real-time market, higher arbitrage revenues are obtained using the proposed strategy compared to the day-ahead market with the perfect foresight. The higher arbitrage value of the real-time market is guaranteed under a wide range of forecast errors and storage parameters. © 2018 IEEE.;"Energy arbitrage; Energy storage; Linear optimization; Optimal dispatch; Real-Time market; Shrinking-Horizon control";;IEEE Computer Society;19449925;9,78E+12;;;English;IEEE Power Energy Soc.

This paper briefly examines the history of crop modelling by international crop research centres of the CGIAR (formerly Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR), whose primary focus is on less developed countries. Basic principles of crop modelling building up to a Genotype × Environment × Management × Socioeconomic (G × E × M × S) paradigm, are explained. Modelling has contributed to better understanding of crop performance and yield gaps, better prediction of pest and insect outbreaks, and improving the efficiency of crop management including irrigation systems and optimization of planting dates. New developments include, for example, use of remote sensed data and mobile phone technology linked to crop management decision support models, data sharing in the new era of big data, and the use of genomic selection and crop simulation models linked to environmental data to help make crop breeding decisions. Socio-economic applications include foresight analysis of agricultural systems under global change scenarios, and the consequences of potential food system shocks are also described. These approaches are discussed in this paper which also calls for closer collaboration among disciplines in order to better serve the crop research and development communities by providing model based recommendations ranging from policy development at the level of governmental agencies to direct crop management support for resource poor farmers. © 2018 by the authors.;"Agri-food-systems; Big data; CGIAR; Crop management; Crop modelling; Data sharing; Food security; Foresight; Global phenotyping networks; International agricultural research";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This has been characterised in the UK by the Foresight obesity systems map, identifying over 100 variables, across seven domain areas which are thought to influence energy balance, and subsequent obesity. Availability of data to consider the whole obesity system is traditionally lacking. However, in an era of big data, new possibilities are emerging. Understanding what data are available can be the first challenge, followed by an inconsistency in data reporting to enable adequate use in the obesity context. In this study we map data sources against the Foresight obesity system map domains and nodes and develop a framework to report big data for obesity research. Opportunities and challenges associated with this new data approach to whole systems obesity research are discussed. Methods: Expert opinion from the ESRC Strategic Network for Obesity was harnessed in order to develop a data source reporting framework for obesity research. The framework was then tested on a range of data sources. In order to assess availability of data sources relevant to obesity research, a data mapping exercise against the Foresight obesity systems map domains and nodes was carried out. Results: A reporting framework was developed to recommend the reporting of key information in line with these headings: Background; Elements; Exemplars; Content; Ownership; Aggregation; Sharing; Temporality (BEE-COAST). The new BEE-COAST framework was successfully applied to eight exemplar data sources from the UK. 80% coverage of the Foresight obesity systems map is possible using a wide range of big data sources. The remaining 20% were primarily biological measurements often captured by more traditional laboratory based research. Conclusions: Big data offer great potential across many domains of obesity research and need to be leveraged in conjunction with traditional data for societal benefit and health promotion. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.";;"Morris, M.A.; Leeds Institute for Data Analytics and School of Medicine, University of LeedsUnited Kingdom; email: m.morris@leeds.ac.uk";Nature Publishing Group;3070565;;IJOBD;30242238;English;Int.

Most of today’s forecast research is centered on the scientific-technical and technological components of innovation activity and employs foresight methodology, with a focus on a continually fine-tuned vision of the future of a specific subject area based on the activity of interested parties engaged in its making. The subject area of transformation of marketing management of the potentials of small and medium-sized businesses is currently in need of a new approach to selecting effective innovation technologies for managing the business amid global change. There is a need for tools that imply the choice of priorities not just in the sphere of science and technology but also in the subject area of marketing management of company potentials, which could help support companies’ innovation activity in the more promising areas of the economy. Foresight research into the development of the theory and technology of management and marketing may become a crucial tool for determining relevant priorities with respect to the subject matter and content of marketing research into the management of the potentials of small and medium-sized businesses within the given subject area.

In recent years, the speed of social change has increased and the complexity in politics and economics has also increased. As such, it has become difficult to look forward appropriate in a timely manner using only conventional methods, and thus the development of various methods is encouraged. Conversely, the formation of a sustainable society faces many difficulties on the international front and many goals for global issues have been set. However, efforts and results for sustainable development are not necessarily desirable. In this study, we examined whether we could effectively solve social problems by combining the development of a foresight approach with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First, we reviewed the concepts of sustainable development. Next, we examined the target of SDGs appropriately to convert our foresight activities. Finally, we propose a future public platform (FPP) for scenario planning in foresight. As a result, we found the importance of considering the SDGs in foresight. We also examined the concept of sustainable development, considering how to integrate the SDGs into foresight, and propose the FPP with SDGs. This FPP effectively involves five SDG targets and appears to be highly executable. Though the system of FPP has a certain difficulty, we could exchange information among experts who are studying SDGs and foresight. Thus, as a case study of connections between foresight and SDGs, it would be helpful for other countries. © 2018, The Author(s).;"Delphi; Foresight; SDGs; Stakeholder; Sustainable development";"Kuribayashi, M.; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science & Technology (MEXT), National Institute of Science & Technology Policy (NISTEP)Japan; email: miki.kuribayashi@nistep.go.jp";Springer Berlin Heidelberg;21954194;;;;English;European J.

First of all, I define futures studies and social futuring and analyse the evolution of futures studies to show how methods have changed and how they could prove useful in the field of social futuring. Furthermore, I examine individual and organizational future orientation and the related “foresight maturity model” that is linked to the idea of social futuring. I compare future orientation indices (e.g. SOFI, JKB) and point out the pros and cons of each. In addition, I also show what kinds of measurement and indices of future orientation could be used in the analysis of individual, organizational and national social futuring.

This article presents the EXIT approach, a novel modeling technique and a computational method for structural cross-impact analysis. EXIT extracts insights from an expert-sourced cross-impact model, which describes the structure of direct interactions within a system. The EXIT transformation produces a relative quantification of the emergent, systemic relationships between model components, effectuating over the complex web of interactions in the system. Compared to the more established matrix multiplication approach, EXIT produces novel and more detailed analytical outputs on the basis of similar input, and offers new analytical possibilities in structural cross-impact analysis.

Because the relevant literature suggests that target selection and the places where terrorist attacks occur are related to a group’s strategies, we also investigate whether and how violent terrorist acts vary with respect to their surroundings in the same jurisdiction when the ideology is the point of comparison. Separatist and leftist terrorist groups committed 1152 violent terrorist acts between 2008 and 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey. Our analysis begins with a comparison of targets and risk factors by the ideology of the perpetrators for 857 separatist and 295 leftist terrorist incidents. After identifying high-risk locations, we test the predictive validity of risk terrain modeling. The study results showed that context and spatial influence—the risky areas of terrorism—vary by the nature of the ideology in the jurisdiction.

For the electricity distribution industry, this has contributed to a growing need to understand how these network monopolies should adapt their role, activities, and responsibilities for a redesigned electricity market, given the growth of distributed generation, and the increased control and monitoring capabilities. Considering this, a foresight study on business model innovation, technological adaptation, and market design policy alternatives is presented. A Policy Delphi method was applied, involving two iterative survey rounds and 207 European experts, which assessed 57 policy alternatives. The results highlight adaptation challenges for implementing new technologies and business practices. Experts support innovation and transition to new roles, and innovative services, while warranting that core electricity distribution activities are secured. This shift in roles is expected to be achieved through research and development (R&D) support policies, innovation friendly regulatory frameworks, and concerted actions at the EU and Member States level. The results provide policy-adaptation guidelines for electricity distribution industry stakeholders. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.;"DSOs; Electricity distribution; EU; Market design; Policy Delphi; Policy design; Smart grids";"Pereira, G.I.; Energy for Sustainability Initiative, MIT Portugal Program in Sustainable Energy Systems, University of Coimbra, Rua Luís Reis dos Santos, Portugal; email: gpereira@student.dem.uc.pt";Springer Netherlands;1387585X;;EDSNB;;English;Environ.

Researchers in the futures field have a great deal to contribute to the policymaking process. But, futures research is often neglected as an element of policymaking. The aim of this paper is to improve the link between futures research and policymaking. More specifically, as Policy Analysis has a strong link with policymaking, this paper explores the possibility of linking Policy Analysis to the futures field through the use of an uncertainty typology applied in Policy Analysis. The typology can be used to structure the various forward-looking disciplines (or subfields) of the futures field according to the level of uncertainty that they address. This linkage can add significantly to the use of futures research in policymaking. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Forecasting; Foresight; Futures studies; Policy analysis; Uncertainty";"van Dorsser, C.; Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Delft University of Technology, Stevinweg 1, 2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; email: J.C.M.vanDorsser@tudelft.nl";Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-85050695031;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Addis Ababa's settlement area has been expanding into the city's peripheral area at the expense of losing green infrastructure (GI) of farmland and vegetated areas. The protection of GI is impeded by the lack of foresight information and tools to support urban planning. Therefore, a GIS-based urban spatial scenario design model (USSDM) was applied for modelling the settlement expansion in Addis Ababa. A business as usual scenario (BAU) and a densification scenario (DENS) were modelled to evaluate the impact of population density on the green infrastructure and the implications of excluding settlement development from flood prone areas. Training and workshops were conducted on the use of USSDM in the Addis Ababa master plan review. The results of our study indicated that increasing population density from 166 to 350 inhabitants per hectare would almost halve the losses of the green infrastructure. Moreover, the settlement development in the densification scenario would be located closer to the vicinity of the built-up area rather than spreading along the eastern part of the city, which is currently occupied by farmland in the case of BAU. Densification would also slow down expansion of settlements in river corridors but might expose more inhabitants to flood hazards. USSDM is one of few models in Africa that is designed towards application by urban planners as a tool of assessing the impact of urban development strategies on the surrounding environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;"Addis Ababa; Scenario modelling; Urban green infrastructure; Urban growth; Urban planning";"Abo-El-Wafa, H.; Chair for Strategic Landscape Planning and Management, School of Life Sciences WeihenstephanSchool of Life Sciences Weihenstephan, Technische Universität München, Emil-Ramann-Str. 6, Germany; email: hany.wafa@tum.de";Elsevier B.V.;1692046;;LUPLE;;English;Landsc.

Forecasts are required on various geographical and temporal scales, which can be modeled as hierarchies. In a geographical hierarchy, the overall forecast for the region can either be obtained by directly forecasting the regional time series or by aggregating the individual forecasts generated for the sub-regions. This leads to a problem known as aggregate inconsistency as the two sets of forecasts are most likely different due to modeling uncertainties. Hence, practice is not optimal. Statistically optimal aggregation known as reconciliation, has been proven to provide aggregate consistent forecasts. Reconciliation helps system operators to have a superior foresight in a region-wise level, which eventually results in efficient system planning. The focus of this paper is on improving reconciliation accuracy. In addition, the effects of more accurate disaggregated and aggregated forecasts on the final reconciled predictions have been analyzed. A total of 318 simulated PV plants in California have been used to build a geographical hierarchy. More accurate NWP based and aggregated level forecasts are obtained with model output statistics and artificial neural network models. Significant improvements are observed in reconciled forecasts without using any exogenous information. © 2018 IEEE.;"Hierarchical forecasting; Model output statistics; Numerical weather prediction; Reconciliation; Solar forecasting";;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;9,78E+12;;;English;IEEE World Conf.

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a content analysis of public domain Spanish Defence National Foresight Exercise, and a study directed to analyse the impact on defence technological and industrial base. Findings: Foresight studies on the defence and security environment uses hybrid methodologies, but rarely involve all the stakeholders, and specially the citizens. The authors place a particular emphasis on the impact of these defence and security foresight studies, and following policies to increase the competitiveness and advanced technologies in the future. The analysis of the Spanish contractors allows an evaluation of the roadmaps as a policy instrument for the industrial defence industry. The main challenges for the next exercises in the European countries are to increase the interest in the firms’ intelligence systems, and the participation and representation of citizens as a way to guarantee their rights. Therefore, a technology roadmap must be complemented with other more participative foresight methods. Originality/value: Foresight studies on the defence and security environment have been the subject of very few systematic analyses of impact.

Achieving the above will entail bridging high-quality basic and preclinical cancer research to research on prevention, early detection and therapeutics as well as improving coordination of translational research efforts across Europe. The latter is expected to be expedited through quality assuring translational cancer research in Comprehensive Cancer Centres – entities that link research with the healthcare system – and networks of cancer research centres. Achieving a critical mass of expertise, resources and patients is crucial. Improving late translational research, which involves clinical studies to assess effectiveness, and added value for the health care is also a high priority. Both high-quality Big Data collections and the intelligent use of these data will promote innovation in cancer research and support outcomes research to assess clinical utility, quality of cancer care and long-term follow-up of treated patients. The EACS supports the mission-oriented approach recently proposed by the European Commission in Horizon Europe to deal with major challenges and would like to persuade the EU and its member states to formally launch a mission in cancer to boost and streamline the cancer research continuum in Europe. Building a coherent translational cancer research continuum with a focus on patients and individuals at risk will require, however, foresight as well as the extensive and continuous provision of evidence-based advice to inform policy. © 2018 The Authors.

Releasing too much water immediately can threaten future supplies and costs, but not releasing enough creates immediate economic hardship downstream. This paper examines how the economic valuation of end-of-year carryover storage can lead to optimal amounts of carryover storage in complex large water resource systems. Economic carryover storage value functions (COSVFs) are developed to represent the value of storage in the face of interannual inflow uncertainty and variability within water resource optimization models. The approach divides a perfect foresight optimization problem into year-long (limited foresight) subproblems solved sequentially by a within-year optimization engine to find optimal short-term operations. The final storage state from the previous year provides the initial condition to each annual problem, and end-of-year COSVFs are the final condition. Here the COSVF parameters that maximize the interannual benefits from river basin operations are found by evolutionary search. This generalized approach can handle nonconvexity in large-scale water resources systems. The approach is illustrated with a regional model of the California Central Valley water system including 30 reservoirs, 22 aquifers, and 51 urban and agricultural demand sites. Head-dependent pumping costs make the optimization problem nonconvex. Optimized interannual reservoir operation improves over more cautious operation in the historical approximation, reducing the average annual scarcity volume and costs by 80% and 98%, respectively, with more realistic representation of hydrologic foresight for California's Mediterranean climate. The economic valuation of storage helps inform water storage decisions. © 2018.

These models and forecasts were used to assess the ability of US energy production sources to meet demand, to anticipate production and technology challenges, and to make general policy recommendations. The logistic fixed condition forecasts indicated the ongoing increases in total US energy production dominated by crude oil and natural gas production will likely peak in 2017 (at 95.0 quadrillion “quad” BTU) then rapidly decrease through 2040 (at 36.2 quad BTU), while total US energy consumption indicated an ongoing plateau (at 98.1 quad BTU). New growth cycles not evident in the 2015 data will certainly occur, mitigating the decline in energy production before 2040. However, without adequate foresight and preemptive action, it is possible that new production growth would not be adequate to reverse the decline given historical growth trends. Therefore, in addition to continued increases in energy efficiency, reductions in use, and implementation of carbon management technologies, direct effort towards the sustainable development of substantial new growth cycles in all energy production sources (through adequate investment of resources) should be a priority of the US energy industry, policy makers, and the public alike. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Energy production and consumption modeling; Fixed condition forecast; Growth cycle; Logistic equation; Logistic growth curve modeling";"Harris, T.M.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Colorado School of MinesUnited States; email: tmharris@mines.edu";Elsevier Ltd;13640321;;RSERF;;English;Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev;2-s2.0-85050855596;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Cloud computing relies mainly on a conceptually centralized service provisioning model, while blockchain technologies originate from a peer-To-peer and a completely distributed approach. Still, noteworthy commonalities between both approaches are often overlooked by researchers. Therefore, to the best of the authors knowledge, this paper reviews both domains in parallel for the first time. We conclude that both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of centralized service provisioning approaches are often the disadvantages of distributed ledger approaches and vice versa. It is obviously an interesting question whether both approaches could be combined in a way that the advantages can be added while the disadvantages could be avoided. We derive a software stack that could build the foundation unifying the best of these two worlds and that would avoid existing shortcomings like vendor lock-in, some security problems, and inherent platform dependencies. © 2018 IEEE.;"Blockchain; Cloud computing; Distributed clouds; Distributed ledger; Security; Serverless";;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;9,78E+12;;;English;Proc. - Int.

To humans this pedestrian intention foresight comes naturally as they are able to recognize another person's actions just by perceiving subtle changes in posture. Approximating this intention inference ability by directly training a deep neural network is useful but especially challenging. First, sufficiently large datasets for intention recognition with frame-wise human pose and intention annotations are rare and expensive to compile. Second, training on smaller datasets can lead to overfitting and make it difficult to adapt to intra-class variations in action executions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a real time framework that learns (i) intention recognition using weak-supervision and (ii) locomotion dynamics of intention from pose information using transfer learning. This new formulation is able to tackle the lack of frame-wise annotations and to learn intra-class variation in action executions. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed approach leads to earlier and more stable detection of intention than other state of the art approaches with real time operation and the ability to detect intention one second before the pedestrian reaches the kerb. © 2018 IEEE.;;;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;9,78E+12;;;English;IEEE Intell Veh Symp Proc;2-s2.0-85056753889;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We should take mass entrepreneurship and innovation (MEI) as a structural reform to stimulate the creativity of the whole society and build a new engine of development. Up to date, the State Council of China has published nearly 30 policy papers to promote China MEI since 2014. To understand policy effectiveness, the State Council entrusted China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) to do the third-party evaluation on the MEI implementation in July 2015. This evaluation was mainly focused on policy tools. We chose several perspectives to evaluate the implementation situation and outcomes of MEI, including the entrepreneurial platforms, financing channels and entrepreneurial groups (university students, scientific and technical workers, returning migrant workers, returnees, etc.). The method we use is including 20 thousand questionnaires sent to the university students and ST workers, big data mining with companies such as Baidu and Ali research, field interview and investigation in 20 provinces, second hand information collecting from Ministries. This paper will show the evaluation results of 2015 MEI and 2016MEI, try to give suggestions for further development of MEI. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

Within the framework of supporting decision making, this research deals with (1) fake information filtering to accurate foresight, (2) credit risk assessment, and (3) prediction based on critical signal detection. At first, financial data including news, SNS, the financial statements is collected and then, among them, fake information such as rumors and fake news is refined by author analysis and the rule-based approach. Second, the credit risk is assessed by opinion mining and sentiment analysis for both social data and news in the form of sentimental score and trend of documents for each stock. Third, a risk signal in stock investment is detected in accordance with the credit risk derived from opinion mining and financial risk identified by the financial database. Consequently, the possibility of credit events such as delisting and bankruptcy will be forecast in the near future based on the risk signal. The proposed algorithm helps investors to monitor relevant information objectively through fake information filtering as well as to make correct judgments in stock investment. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

It is premised on extreme digital connectivity to build smart factories and deliver extreme automation in science and society. Industry 4.0 has recently scaled up worldwide beyond Germany and Europe. Industry 4.0 employs the Internet of Things (IoT) to connect, communicate, and collect big data from embedded sensors in living and inanimate objects. When we add artificial intelligence (AI) powered real-time data analyses to the IoT, a state of worldwide extreme connectivity, or ""The Quantified Planet,"" is created. By its focus on connectivity at a systems scale, the Industry 4.0 is of interest to health products manufacturing and service automation in medicine, biology, ecology, and society. But there are also unchecked assumptions. This article poses a question that has so far been neglected in the Industry 4.0 innovation echo chamber. Is it always good to have pervasive connectivity and extreme integration to the point that ""everything is connected to everything else""? For example, extreme connectivity creates an ""All Your Eggs in One Basket"" problem and thus potential for complete network collapse in a domino effect when a component in a highly integrated system fails. Digital connectivity cultivates a fertile ground for new social and political power structures for authoritarian governance (i.e., a worrisome state of ""pansurveillance"") by one person in total control of knowledge networks in science and society, directly or through connected proxies. Filter bubbles created by extreme digital connectivity and AI can result in compressed foresight, lackluster innovation, and monocultures in laboratory life. The way forward is to harness Industry 4.0 and connectivity without such digital network toxicity. Similar to fire exits in skyscrapers and other built environments, designing innovation systems with extreme connectivity demands that we also think of ""exit plans"" from the omnipresent digital networks, IoT, and The Quantified Planet-both for safety and sustained creativity. Finally, the relationship between new technologies and society is far from being a simple one-directional interaction; it is not the technologies that cause social disruption. On the contrary, it is the value-loaded decisions made by individuals, organizations, and other social actors that shape sociotechnical change. Recognizing the latter narrative is important because it informs how we do science and can best respond to uncertainties and opaque assumptions embedded in emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and Industry 4.0. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.";"Artificial intelligence; Critical policy studies; Industry 4.0; Sensors; The Internet of Things; The Quantified Planet";"Özdemir, V.; Technology, Society and Democracy, School of Biotechnology, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita UniversityCanada; email: vural.ozdemir@alumni.utoronto.ca";Mary Ann Liebert Inc.;15362310;;OMICA;30260734;English;OMICS J.

Here, we introduce a new methodology for simulating crop-water production functions using process-based crop growth models, which captures explicitly the interacting effects of farmers' intraseasonal irrigation decision-making, stochastic weather conditions, and physical and socio-economic water supply constraints on seasonal crop yield response to water. Through a case study application for groundwater irrigated corn production in the Texas High Plains, we demonstrate that constraints to irrigation scheduling caused by aquifer depletion, combined with farmers' limited foresight of future weather conditions, have significant impacts on estimated seasonal crop-water production functions. Our results highlight that the failure to account for these factors fully in previous simulation approaches will lead to errors in estimates of the impacts of groundwater depletion on farmers' future resilience to drought and climate change. Our proposed simulation methodology is generalizable to different production systems or crop growth models, and provides a tool for assessing how economic benefits derived from irrigation vary spatially and temporally due to heterogeneity in biophysical conditions and irrigation practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Climate variability; Crop-water production function; Deficit irrigation; Hydro-economic; Irrigation; Valuation";"Foster, T.; School of Mechanical, Aerospace & Civil Engineering, University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom; email: timothy.foster@manchester.ac.uk";Elsevier B.V.;9218009;;ECECE;;English;Ecol.

CSU requires both collective insight-i.e., accurate and deep understanding of a situation derived from uncertain and often sparse data and collective foresight-i.e., the ability to predict what will happen in the future. When it comes to complex scenarios, the need for a distributed CSU naturally emerges, as a single monolithic approach not only is unfeasible: It is also undesirable. We therefore propose a principled, critical analysis of AI techniques that can support specific tasks for CSU to derive guidelines for designing distributed systems for CSU. © 2018 ISIF;"artificial intelligence for situational understanding; collective situational understanding; critical analysis of artificial intelligence techniques";;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;9,78E+12;;;English;Int.

This article reports an international study of Big Data for policy initiatives to understand the role played by data-driven approaches in the policy process. Drawing on evidence (including policy analysis and interviews with stakeholders) from 58 initiatives, we find that some policy areas, notably efforts to improve government transparency, are far more represented than others, such as use of social media data for policy evaluation. We also find Big Data used more often in the policy cycle for foresight and agenda setting, or interim evaluation and monitoring, rather than for policy implementation and ex post evaluation. Many different types of data are used in the policy process, with traditional sources such as government statistics still favored over new and emerging sources. We find that use of Big Data for public policy is therefore at an early stage, with expectations far outstripping the current reality. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization;"Big Data; Europe; governance; policy process; policymaking";;Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd;19442866;;;;English;Policy Internet;2-s2.0-85050646812;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The HBP aims to create a digital research infrastructure for brain science, cognitive neuroscience, and brain-inspired computing. This paper builds on work undertaken in the HBP's Ethics and Society subproject (SP12). Collaborators from two activities in SP12, Foresight and Researcher Awareness on the one hand, and Ethics Management on the other, use the case of machine intelligence to illustrate key aspects of the dynamic processes through which questions of ethics and society, including existential risks, are approached in the organisational context of the HBP.

Hence, as Andr6-Yves Portnoff and Jean-Frangois Soupizet assert, a whole new ecosystem is emerging. What might the applications of Al be? There are already countless possible uses, ranging from the milking of goats, banking services, autonomous vehicles, digital marketing and smart cities to health and sabotage...Some experts who subscribe to the ""technological singularity"" theory even believe that Al could take over the planet, an assertion staunchly contested here by our authors who do, however, stress how much the division of roles between men and machines needs to be rethought, as does the relationship between them. They also point out, incidentally, that the spread of Al within businesses hasn't gone as far as all that, since that would imply profound changes in forms of organization and management-in short, a cultural revolution, and culture does not move at the same pace as technological advance!Turning to the question of the players involved, they stress the conflict between the new entrants (the American and Chinese Internet giants) and traditional companies, together with states whose sovereignty is seriously impaired as a result; but these latter may discover that Al affords them the means to restore their power,for better or for worse, in years to come. Drawing in this article on a foresight analysis carried out for the members of the Futur- ibles International association, Andr6-Yves Portnoff and Jean-Francois Soupizet venture to outline a number of possible futures. These are not scenarios properly so-called, but contrasting models. They include the ""privatized digital panopticon"", characterized by the supremacy of the digital giants; the ""statized digital panopticon"", which would see the Chinese regime and the IT giants coming together in their own shared interest; the ""enlightened long-termist"" model; and that of ""digital criminalities"". In doing so,the authors show once again how technologies are double-edged and how it is important that we-and particularly we Europeans-take responsibility when choices are being made that will undoubtedly shape the future for many years to come. © 2018 Futuribles.

Since technology is for society, Future oriented Technology Analyses (FTA) have been widely implemented based on different concepts through different dimensions. Foresight, one of the FTA, has evolved throughout its journey within its generations until today. In this article, foresight generations in the literature are put forth as grouped and the framework of new technology foresight generation as sixth generation (Foresight 6.0) is offered and detailed. Foresight 6.0 is evaluated on the focused dimensions, participating actors, economic bases and principles. The rising concepts of Industry 4.0, netocracy, cyberspace, biotechnology, ethical values and blurriness of the roles in economy are the primary factors in this new generation of foresight. © 2018 IEEE.;"artificial intelligence; biotechnology; cyberspace; cyborgs; foresight; foresight generations; Industry 4.0; netocracy; technology foresight";;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;9,78E+12;;;English;IEEE Int.

Governments evaluate outputs and outcomes of R&D programs regularly and budget for next year on the basis of program assessment. However, existing assessment methodology disregards long-term technology development; in sectors such as the energy sector, it takes a long time for technologies to progress from R&D to commercialization. This paper is a comparative analysis of existing R&D assessment models and the new foresight model developed from the point of view of government. A regression analysis is conducted using probit and ordinary least squares (OLS) models to analyze the performance of projects completed based on past R&D investment. The foresight model, which is based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), is discussed in comparison. Results of the regression analysis show that government investment in market expansion of renewable energy technologies is minimal in Korea. In contrast, the LCOE foresight model results show that renewable energy technologies are appropriate targets for government R&D investment. The foresight model should be utilized for government R&D decision-making in the energy sector because it brings to light hidden information, including learning rates and technology dynamics, which remains unaddressed when analyzing using existing R&D assessment models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"Government R&D; LCOE foresight; R&D assessment; R&D decision-making; R&D investment";"Yang, J.-S.; Graduate School of Future Strategy, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and TechnologySouth Korea; email: yang@kaist.ac.kr";Elsevier Ltd;2211467X;;;;English;Energy Strateg.

However, impulsivity is a multidimensional construct and different subdomains likely underlie different patterns of alcohol misuse. Here, we quantified the association between alcohol intoxication frequency and alcohol consumption frequency and choice, action, cognitive, and trait domains of impulsivity. Methods: University student drinkers (n = 106) completed a battery of demographic and alcohol-related items, as well as self-report and task-based measures indexing different facets of impulsivity. Two orthogonal latent factors, intoxication frequency and alcohol consumption frequency, were generated. Their validity was demonstrated with respect to adverse consequences of alcohol use. Machine learning with penalized regression and feature selection was then utilized to predict intoxication and alcohol consumption frequency using all impulsivity subdomains. Out-of-sample validation was used to quantify model performance. Results: Impulsivity measures alone were significant predictors of intoxication frequency, but not consumption frequency. Propensity for increased intoxication frequency was characterized by increased trait impulsivity, including the Disinhibition subscale of the Sensation Seeking Scale, Attentional and Non-planning subscales of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, increased task-based cognitive impulsivity (response time variability), and increased choice impulsivity (steeper delay discounting on a delay discounting questionnaire). A model combining impulsivity domains with other risk factors (gender; nicotine, cannabis, and other drug use; executive functioning; and learning processes) was also significant but did not outperform the model comprising of impulsivity alone. Conclusions: Intoxication frequency, but not consumption frequency, was characterized by a number of impulsivity subdomains.

The value obtained is based on an optimal operation (consisting of charge/discharge sequences) of the ESS. In other words, it is the maximum value that may be obtained when the ESS charge/discharge sequence is adapted to the expected operational conditions. To obtain that optimal value, this paper describes a dynamic program approach, with the particularity that the switching decisions are optimized considering an uncertain price evolution and a dynamic calculation of the aging cost. A practical implementation of this approach is proposed, in which the problem is conveniently sliced into matrices corresponding to single decisions. It is shown that such an arrangement, combined with shift and re-indexing operators, provides a fast solution to the optimization problem consisting of a huge number of decision evaluations. The algorithm is then applied to a number of European electricity markets, with a particular focus on arbitrage. The particularities of the algorithm solutions are analyzed, and it is shown that not considering the imperfect foresight and the aging impacts leads to considerable errors in valuing an ESS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Battery aging; Dynamic programming; Economic value; Optimization; Stochastic analysis";"Díaz, G.; Dep. of Electrical Engineering, University of Oviedo, Campus de Viesques, s/n, Spain; email: guzman@uniovi.es";Elsevier Ltd;3605442;;ENEYD;;English;Energy;2-s2.0-85047402826;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper constructed a modified user cost model to calculate the indium resource tax and then constructed a transformed Lerner index and an SMR model based on the seller's perspective to calculate the value of market power. Then, it embedded those parameters into a tax transfer model to evaluate the alternative effects of the indium resource tax on tariffs. As we observed, the theoretical tax rate for the indium resource tax fluctuated between 0.67% and 15.53%, and the alternative tax rate for the indium resource tax ranged from 0.32% to 13.03%. By evaluating the alternative effects of the resource tax on tariffs from an endogenous perspective, it can be seen that market powers of the indium processing enterprise and export enterprise, the supply price elasticity of indium processing enterprise and the demand price elasticity of indium export enterprise will have a significant impact on the effect of substituting tariffs with a resource tax. Therefore, the Chinese government should accelerate the vertical integration of the indium resource industry and enhance the market power and supply elasticity of export enterprises through policy measures. Taking the resource tax as the core means of indium resource management, strategies to prevent international disputes concerning the selection of raw materials for trade are discussed, and new analytical insights and directions are provided, which can be applied to similar issues for other metals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Indium; Market power; Pricing power; Resource tax; Tariffs";"Hai-ling, L.; School of Business, Central South UniversityChina; email: hilynn_lee1027@csu.edu.cn";Elsevier Ltd;3014207;;;;English;Resour.

To this day, many papers on this topic have been published. However, research so far has only dealt with specific aspects, but it has failed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research domain. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to organize existing insights and knowledge. The 91 relevant papers, published between 1997 and 2017, are analyzed for their distribution over time and research outlets. Classifying them by their distinct properties, we study the data sources exploited and the data mining techniques applied. We also consider eight different purposes of analysis, namely weak signals and trends concerning political, economic, social and technological factors. The results of our systematic review show that the research domain has indeed been attracting growing attention over time. Furthermore, we observe a great variety of data mining and visualization techniques, and present insights on the efficacy and effectiveness of the data mining techniques applied. Our results reveal that a stronger emphasis on search strategies, data quality and automation is required to greatly reduce the human actor bias in the early stages of the corporate foresight process, thus supporting human experts more effectively in later stages such as strategic decision making and implementation. Moreover, systems for detecting weak signals and trends need to be able to learn and accumulate knowledge over time, attaining a holistic view on weak signals and trends, and incorporating multiple source types to provide a solid foundation for strategic decision making.

Recent work has shown that within-group heterogeneity can under some conditions promote voluntary provisioning of collective goods. Here we generalize this work for the case when individuals can not only contribute to the production of collective goods, but also punish free-riders. To do this, we extend the standard theory by allowing individuals to have limited foresight so they can anticipate actions of their group-mates. For humans, this is a realistic assumption because we possess a “theory of mind”. We use agent-based simulations to study collective actions that aim to overcome challenges from nature or win competition with neighboring groups. We contrast the dynamics of collective action in egalitarian and hierarchical groups. We show that foresight allows groups to overcome both the first- and second-order free-rider problems. While foresight increases cooperation, it does not necessarily result in higher payoffs. We show that while between-group conflicts promotes within-group cooperation, the effects of cultural group selection on cooperation are relatively small. Our models predict the emergence of a division of labor in which more powerful individuals specialize in punishment while less powerful individuals mostly contribute to the production of collective goods. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;"Conflict; Cooperation; Cultural group selection; Modeling; Theory of mind";"Gavrilets, S.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Department of Mathematics, National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, Center for the Dynamics of Social Complexity, University of TennesseeUnited States; email: gavrila@tiem.utk.edu";Springer New York LLC;224715;;;;English;J.

Variation in the stock price or the financial ratio is used as the dependent variable of either short- or long-term effectiveness to evaluate the variance both before and after asset restructuring. The result is varied. It is necessary to develop a foresight approach for the mixed situation. This work pioneers to forecast effectiveness of asset restructuring with a rebalanced and clustered support vector machine (RCS). The profitability variation 1 year before and after asset restructuring is used as the dependent variable. The current financial indicators of the year of asset restructuring are used as independent variables. Specially treated listed companies are used as research samples, as they frequently adopt asset restructuring. In modeling, the skew distribution of samples achieving and failing to achieve performance improvement with asset restructuring is handled with rebalancing. The similar experienced knowledge of asset restructuring to the current asset restructuring is filtered out with clustering. With the help from rebalancing and clustering, a support vector machine is constructed for prediction, together with other forecasting models of multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, probit regression, and case-based reasoning. These models' standalone modes are used as benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate the applicability of the RCS for forecasting effectiveness of asset restructuring.

This paper incorporates tax foresight into a framework of time-varying structural vector autoregression models with stochastic volatility to account for both types of biases. This reveals the effects of changing degrees of tax foresight on U.S.Tax policy. Two findings stand out: First, anticipated and unanticipated tax shocks show considerable time variations, suggesting that some tax reforms were more anticipated than others. Second, the time-varying bias reveals that tax foresight was higher during the 1980s and 1990s than during the 1960s and 1970s. The results compare well with the literature and find support in documented U.S.Tax episodes.

At the same time, the governance of the global domain of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is undergoing a transformation itself, as it evolves from the paradigm of traditional single state-actor efforts to multilateral collaborations. This paper offers a theoretical perspective to adapting to external and internal changes through foresight. Drawing on contemporary safety approaches to resilience and reliability, it highlights three qualitative methods at various levels of depth: horizon scanning, scenario building, and live simulation. In considering the merits of foresight activities as vehicle for transparency and confidence building, as forum for reflection across multiple actors, and for the reconciliation of divergent stakeholder interests, it makes the case for concerted foresight efforts as indispensable measure to explore, understand and respond to incremental and disruptive change. © 2018 International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety;"Foresight; International relations; Space operations; Space security resilience; Space situational awareness; Space surveillance & tracking";;Elsevier Ltd;24688975;;;;English;J.

Motivated by a need for establishing information superiority through decision-support analysis, the framework is designed to use symbiotic simulation and is also suitable for the hindsight and foresight studies that drive crisis-related preparedness exercises. The framework provides a novel feature of incorporating Human in the Loop simulations using virtual reality as a part of the symbiotic simulation. We coin the term perennial simulation to refer to our framework being enduring (the simulation working symbiotically with the real system), and recurring (performing “what-if?” simulations and continually providing feedback to the real system). Three case studies examine the application of the framework to crisis-related scenarios. The framework is shown to be useful and capable of dealing with crisis situations and adding value to existing expert advice, forming a symbiotic feedback loop that aids crisis management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Crisis management simulation; Symbiotic simulation";"Tan, G.; National University of SingaporeSingapore; email: gtan@comp.nus.edu.sg";Elsevier B.V.;1569190X;;;;English;Simul.

The text briefly reviews some paths followed by the SUS as referred to in the Federal Constitution of 1988. It highlights the movement towards the decentralization of care and the constraint of health financial resources that reduced policies of increasing public expenditures. It examines the public and private arrangements for financing and provision of services that have resulted in sectoral privatization, mainly from economic policies articulated with concession of fiscal benefits. It analyzes the changes in the public sector financing through successive constitutional amendments that resulted in the weakening of established social protection policies, particularly of the health sector. For the future, the text considers population aging and analyzes trends in the epidemiological profile, with consequent changes in the health care paradigm. The article concludes by pointing out the consequences of fiscal strangling in the organization of the healthcare system and the need to reverse legal provisions that hamper the fulfillment of the constitutional mandate for equity and universality. © 2018, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

It is a participatory approach centred on design know-how, which promotes innovative forms of engagement and articulation. The proposed methodology balances experience in designing and applying foresight approaches and futures literacy knowledge labs together with a multidisciplinary understanding of institutional context. The methodology fosters decision making processes that embrace complexity and treat uncertainty as a resource, thus improving an organisations’ capacity to use the future to expand its understanding of the present. It has been applied at the Center for Strategic Studies and Management (CGEE), an organisation where institutionalised foresight and technology assessment takes place in Brazil, especially in support of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy design and implementation, as well as evaluation. However, its clients also include different ministries within government and industries alike. The article outlines the ways in which the organisation involved all its collaborators in jointly rethinking its future, building upon collective intelligence, narrative building, sense making, framing and reframing. The design principles called for these experiments to follow a collective learning curve that enable a renewed focus on systemic and transformative innovation. The crafting of new strategic questions was inspired by jointly expanding the understanding of the imaginary futures of the interrelated systems in which the organisation might play a role. As a consequence, new and disruptive possible roles for the institution were identified. These insights then informed the assessment and choices for the redesign of the business strategy. This paper presents the methodology for combining design thinking and futures literacy, the application of this methodology to CGEE, and the major findings of the overall exercise. Readers will find out about the impact of this exercise on the organisation’s approach to both its own strategic positioning and to the design and implementation of foresight and strategic studies. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of the proposed methodology for foresight practice. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;"complexity and uncertainty; engagement and articulation; Futures literacy and design thinking";"Cagnin, C.; Centre for Strategic Studies and Management (CGEE), SCS Qd 9, Lote C, Torre C, 4° andar, Salas 401 A 405, Ed.

This PhD breakthrough article offers foresight as a means of addressing this uncertainty and models its complementarity in the context of the health workforce planning problem. The article summarises the findings of a two-case multi-phase mixed method study that incorporates actor analysis, scenario development and policy Delphi. This reveals a few dominant actors of considerable influence who are in conflict over a few critical workforce issues. Using these to augment normative scenarios, developed from existing clinically developed model of care visions, a number of exploratory alternative descriptions of future workforce situations are produced for each case. Their analysis reveals that these scenarios are a reasonable facsimile of plausible futures, though some are favoured over others. Policy directions to support these favoured aspects can also be identified. This novel approach offers workforce planners and policy makers some guidance on the use of complimentary data, methods to overcome the limitations of conventional workforce forecasting and a framework for exploring the complexities and ambiguities of a health workforce’s evolution. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.;"foresight; health futures; health workforce planning; New Zealand; workforce forecasting";"Rees, G.H.; Universidad ESAN, Alonso Molina 1652, Moterrico Chico, Peru; email: grees@esan.edu.pe";SAGE Publications Ltd;9514848;;HSRME;29665724;English;Health Serv.

The author analyzes the historical peculiarities of technoscience as a specific form, on the one hand, of organization of scientific cognition and, on the other, of interaction between science and society, separating processes that increase the social responsibility of science and the effects of orientation toward solving pragmatic problems on scientific process, in particular, the transformation of methodological norms. The concepts of social and humanistic technologies are considered critically; several problems that arise owing to the technologization of socio-humanistic knowledge are investigated. It is justified that technological development requires not only a complex approach, implying the use of socio-humanistic technologies, but also socio-humanistic support, which cannot be understood technologically. The disciplinary status of such support is discussed; in particular, the recent widely used concept of transdisciplinarity is analyzed, and the conclusion is made that socio-humanistic support goes beyond professional scientific activity into the sphere of broad social practice. Foresight is considered as an example of such a transformation. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.";"foresight; humanistic technologies; philosophy of technology; social design; social practices; social technologies; socio-humanistic appraisal; technological development; technology forecasting; technoscience; transdisciplinarity";"Pirozhkova, S.V.; Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of SciencesRussian Federation; email: pirozhkovasv@gmail.com";Pleiades Publishing;10193316;;;;English;Her.

Thus, health workforce planning is likely to benefit from improved problem identification, response formulation and data and methods that provide deeper understandings of socially influenced systems. Actor analysis is able to facilitate this through its examination of actor goals, interactions, and influences. We explore the use of this infrequently reported method in the context of health workforce planning. Through an embedded mixed methods design, we draw on data from inductive document analysis, deductively coded semi-structured interview responses from two separate but interconnected health sub sectors and numerically transform these to comply with the selected actor analysis software's input requirements. Our findings underline the importance of actor analysis as an investigative resource for delineating actor positions on a range of strategic issues pertinent to health workforce futures to reveal a different perspective of the system's evolution than that derived from conventional health workforce forecasting methods. A hierarchy of critical issues and the influential actors that hold sway over the workforce discourse are found, providing some insight into why conventional workforce plans can provide less than expected results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Actor analysis; Foresight; Health futures; Health workforce planning; New Zealand";"Rees, G.H.; Universidad ESANPeru; email: grees@esan.edu.pe";Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-85044276098;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

OCs prove to be a valuable and dynamic source of information. External information sources are also important for foresight in order to be able to identify and monitor all relevant changes. However, traditional foresight methods are rather static in comparison with dynamic OCs. Thus, this study gives first insights into the use of OCs for foresight. First, based on literature, it is conceptually shown that OCs can contribute to foresight. Second, the question of how to assess the potential of OCs for foresight is considered. Renewable energies OCs are identified using a netnographic approach. One selected OC is analyzed in-depth by applying a prior developed criteria catalog which is based on Popper's (2008) foresight diamond. Each of its four dimensions – creativity, expertise, interaction, and evidence – is operationalized with measurement items taken from literature. In particular, the evidence dimension is supported by a text mining approach. Lastly, a focus group interview proves the usefulness of OCs for foresight. The findings show that OCs can contribute to each dimension of the foresight diamond and serve as an additional source of information for foresight. © 2018 The Author;"Focus group interview; Netnography; Online community; Open foresight; Renewable energy; Topic modeling";;Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

However, theories deal ambiguously with different options that have the same expected utility. A network approach is proposed by introducing ‘goal’ and ‘time’ factors to reduce the ambiguity in strategies for calculating the time-dependent probability of reaching a goal. As such, a mathematical foundation that explains the irrational behavior of choosing an option with a lower expected utility is revealed, which could imply that humans possess rationality in foresight. © 2018 Pan, Chen.

The new methods challenge human intelligibility. The digital revolution (deep connectionist machine learning, big data, cloud computing, simulation, etc.) inspires such claims, but they are not new. During several historical periods, scientific progress has challenged traditional concepts of reasoning and rationality, intelligence and intelligibility, explanation and knowledge. The increasing intelligence of machine learning and networking is a deliberately sought, somewhat alien intelligence. As such, it challenges the traditional, heuristic foresight of expert researchers. Nonetheless, science remains human-centered in important ways—and yet many of our ordinary human epistemic activities are alien to ourselves. This fact has always been the source of “the discovery problem”. It generalizes to the problem of understanding expert scientific practice. Ironically, scientific progress plunges us ever deeper into complexities beyond our grasp. But how is progress possible without traditional realism and the intelligibility realism requires? Pragmatic flexibility offers an answer. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature;"Alien intelligence; Big data; Deep neural networks; Expertise; Heuristics; Intelligibility; Scientific progress; Scientific realism; Scientific reasoning; The end of traditional science";"Nickles, T.; Department of Philosophy Emeritus, University of Nevada, RenoUnited States; email: nickles@unr.edu";Springer Netherlands;1677411;;;;English;Topoi;2-s2.0-85046016543;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the future studies, the identification of future signal is one of the renowned techniques for analysis of trends, emerging issue, and gaining future insights. In the Big Data era, recent scholars have proposed using a text mining procedure focusing upon web data such as new social media and academic papers. However, the detection of future signals is still under a developing area of research, and there is much to improve existing methodology as well as developing theoretical foundations. The present study reviews previous literature on identifying emerging issue based on the weak signal detection approach. Then the authors proposed a revised framework that incorporate quantitative and qualitative text mining for assessing the strength of future signals. The authors applied the framework to the case study on the ethical issues of artificial intelligence (hereafter AI). From EBSCO host database, the authors collected text data covering the ethical issues in AI and conducted text mining analysis. Results reveal that emerging ethical issues can be classified as strong signal, weak signal, well-known but not so strong signal, and latent signal. The revised methodology will be able to provide insights for government and business stakeholders by identifying the future signals and their meanings in various fields. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;"Artificial intelligence; Data-driven foresight; Ethical issue; Future signal; Text mining";"Lee, Y.-J.; Future Strategy Center, National Information Society Agency (NIA), 53, Cheomdan-ro, Dong-gu, South Korea; email: billieyz@gmail.com";Springer Netherlands;335177;;;;English;Qual.

It is argued that foresight is an appropriate instrument to shape innovation systems and support policy-making processes, thus, foresight has attracted interest in developing countries. However, the ability to effectively exploit its results is hampered by the limitations of their governance systems to take into account the complexity in the definition of public policies. In such a context, foresight needs to be more thoroughly integrated into the policy making process to be effective. Attempts to engage excluded indigenous or poor peasant, communities in development plans have also been made and in this context, foresight activities in these communities have been conducted, but the consultations have not been strategic and forward-looking enough to connect to policy-making beyond the specific local settings. In this paper, we propose a novel interconnected multilevel approach containing two elements of policy making to support innovation for inclusive development: a) the close interplay between foresight and policy making, and b) the linking of local community-level to national level foresight. Such an approach is well suited for using foresight to inform and guide policy to frame the national innovation system that can attend both economic and social development goals. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight; Inclusive development; Innovation systems; Multilevel foresight; Parallel foresight; Research and innovation policy";"Aguirre-Bastos, C.; Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e InnovaciónPanama; email: caguirre@senacyt.gob.pa";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Based on a 2-country Bayesian VAR model between major European economies, we found that an unanticipated fiscal stimulus leads to expectations of strong deficit reversals. This in turn depresses domestic and foreign activity. Foresight shocks, on the contrary, have positive effects on domestic activity. Differences in the responses to surprise and foresight shocks reflect the role of expectations.

Planning can seem like a reckoning with “real” economic constraints of household budgetary truths; however, financial planning begins with imaginative acts. To plan, families must craft “projective fictions,” forecasts of trends in the broader economy and family life with which they can guide parenting actions in the present. Drawing on inspiration from ethnographic interviews with more than 160 middle-class college students and their families, this essay examines government policy and financial industry agendas that have linked planning practices with familial virtue. A contrast between two “regimes of foresight” and their moralities—the mid-century US policies’ regime of “near-term prudence” and the contemporary regime of “distant modeling”—exposes the work “real economy” accomplishes: the policies and instruments of planning produce and distribute virtue as much as financial outcomes. © The Society for Ethnographic Theory.

Integration of ""-omics"" and multi-omics research is of high priority in sepsis, a heterogeneous syndrome that is widely recognized as a global health burden and a priority biomedical funding field. We report here an original study on bibliometric trends in the use of ""-omics"" technologies, and multi-omics approaches in particular, in sepsis research in three (supra)national settings, the United States, the European Union 28 Member States (EU-28), and China. Using a 5-year longitudinal bibliometric study design from 2011 to 2015, we analyzed the sepsis-related research articles in English language that included at least one or multi-omics technologies in publicly available form in Medline (free full texts). We found that the United States has had the lead (almost one-third of publications) in the inclusion of an ""-omics"" or multi-omics technology in sepsis within the study period. However, both China and the EU-28 displayed a significant increase in the number of publications that employed one or more types of ""-omics"" research (p < 0.005), while the EU-28 displayed a significant increase especially in multi-omics research articles in sepsis (p < 0.05). Notably, more than half of the multi-omics research studies in the sepsis knowledge domain had a university or government/state funding source. Among the multi-omics research publications in sepsis, the combination of genomics and transcriptomics was the most frequent (40.5%), followed by genomics and proteomics (20.4%). We suggest that the lead of the United States in the field of ""-omics"" and multi-omics research in sepsis is likely at stake, with both the EU-28 and China rapidly increasing their research capacity. Moreover, ""triple omics"" that combine genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analyses appear to be uncommon in sepsis, and yet much needed for triangulation of systems science data. These observations have implications for ""-omics"" technology policy and global research funding strategic foresight. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.";"bioeconomy; funding sources; multi-omics; research policy; sepsis";"Evangelatos, N.; Intensive Care Medicine Unit, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergology and Sleep Medicine, Paracelsus Medical University (PMU), Prof. Ernst-Nathan-Strasse 1, Germany; email: nikos.evangelatos@gmail.com";Mary Ann Liebert Inc.;15362310;;OMICA;29649387;English;OMICS J.

But the direct consequences of social and ecological change are often not thoroughly identified and explored in policy analysis, and possible higher-order implications are rarely considered. This study used a structured group process called the Futures Wheel to uncover and analyze possible higher-order implications of an important trend in US Northern forests: lack of age-class diversity and uniform aging. Multidisciplinary teams of participants generated 384 possible second- and third-order implications of this trend and scored them for desirability and likelihood. The large set of implications identified by our participants suggests some daunting challenges. But positive consequences also emerged from the group process, indicating opportunities. Foresight tools such as the Futures Wheel can help environmental decision makers anticipate the future to avoid problems and make the most of opportunities. © 2017;"Cascading change; Futures Wheel; Implications Wheel; Northern forests";"Bengston, D.N.; Strategic Foresight Group, Northern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 1992 Folwell Avenue, United States; email: dbengston@fs.fed.us";Elsevier Ltd;2648377;;;;English;Land Use Policy;2-s2.0-85036627647;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such initiatives provide real-time monitoring capabilities, and effective modelling techniques allow the prediction of future states in a city. For example, urban electricity smart meter data can be utilised to predict future demand in order to facilitate capacity planning. However, the accuracy of this foresight is often marred by low quality and missing sensor data in real-world systems. In this work, we focus on the problem of reliable forecasting by mitigating the effect of missing data on forecast accuracy. In order to mitigate the effects of missing data, we develop a multi-task learning scheme to jointly learn Gaussian Process Regression models between highly correlated sensors. We demonstrate that our methods are robust in a variety of error generation scenarios. We validate our methods based on publicly available and real-world datasets related to electricity smart meters in a university campus and pedestrian counts in a global city, where we achieve significant improvement over competitive baselines and other effective forecasting methods. © 2017 IEEE.;"Gaussian Process Regression; Multi-step Forecasting; Multi-task Learning; Smart Cities; Smart Sensors; Time Series";;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;9,78E+12;;;English;Proc. - IEEE Int.

Applying the tool of a global meat tax will lead to a “double dividend” as negative externalities are reduced and at the same time huge tax revenues will be generated which could be used to make further steps in the direction of achieving the stated FAO goal in the Rome Declaration. © 2018, Agricultural Economics.

They can contribute significantly not only to economic success but also to greater sustainability. Nevertheless, it is not a trivial task for established companies to recognize the potential of disruptive changes and to implement innovations in time. In this context, foresight and openness are proposed as promising approaches. This paper investigates the collaborative open foresight approach for inspiring discontinuous and sustainability-oriented innovations. The results of a longitudinal case study involving two companies show that the participants especially value that collaborative open foresight (1) fosters out-of-the-box thinking (2) supports breaking away from path dependency, and (3) increases the potential of innovations. Most importantly, the joint discussion and analysis of future developments (4) help to generate new insights regarding the opportunities and risks of the disruptive changes identified as well as their potential for discontinuous and sustainability-oriented innovations. It was particularly noteworthy that both companies recognized a significant value-added of collaborative open foresight compared to their previous foresight projects, so far conducted individually, but only one of the two companies could transfer the project's outcome to innovation projects. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;"Collaborative open foresight; Discontinuous innovations; Incumbents; Sustainability-oriented innovations";"Wiener, M.; Institute for Integrated Quality Design, Johannes Kepler University, Altenbergerstraße 69, Austria; email: melanie.wiener@jku.at";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Modern enterprises are interested in receiving reasonable foresight forecasts in marketing, which was not sufficiently distributed in the practical activity of the enterprise. Theoretical and practical aspects of the foresight framework are still explored insufficiently. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to improve the theoretical framework of foresight marketing and to create the conceptual model of foresight marketing. The following scientific methods have been used in this research: system analysis, content analysis, comparative method, method of logical generalization, morphological method, dialectics of the relationship between fundamental and applied knowledge. The analysis revealed imperfection of the theoretical apparatus of foresight marketing, thus, the modern approach to the interconnection and balance of foresight marketing and strategic marketing on the enterprises was suggested. To develop a conceptual model of foresight marketing, the authors have considered and described its major components. A conceptual model of foresight marketing is a systematic combination of certain elements, namely: conditions, barriers, and prerequisites; subject and object; methodology of foresight marketing; principles, tools, and categories. The article presents a generalized model of foresight marketing process, which shows the basic subjects and bases on four consecutive stages. The authors provide a new perspective as for the concept of foresight marketing and the basic prerequisites for the implementation of foresight in marketing management. © 2015 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

The methodological framework of the Finnish technology foresight study is shortly introduced and explained in this article. The analysis reflects current discussion about 3D printing technology options in Finland, as is reflected in report of Linturi et al. (2013, 2014). The analyses of 3D printing provided in this article are also linked to broader international and European context. TechCast study (Halal, 2013) and FutMan scenarios of JRC (Geyer et al., 2003a, 2003b) are elaborated. The analyses reveal several emerging aspects and bottlenecks of 3D printing and new industrial revolution. The emerging aspects are related to the rise of new technological possibilities and new production processes. The bottlenecks include issues such as lacking capacities and competencies of industrial actors in adopting new technological solutions, uncertainties in the efficiency and performance of 3D printing solutions, problematic of wider societal transition, and potential risks potentially generated by 3D printing systems and technologies.

Risk managers recommend the use of the best available rainfall forecast, but some water managers have recommended use only of actual rainfalls. This paper uses risk management rules, constructs of foresight, notions of storage error and release error, and the risk concept of ‘regret’ to explain the advantages and disadvantages of both rationales. The conclusion - risk management performs better with the worst floods, and the alternative may perform better when forecast floods do not eventuate. © CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

They are complicated, resource-intensive, and quite expensive. The approach, methods, and techniques must be carefully identified and selected. Despite the global importance of foresight activities, there are no frameworks to help one develop and plan a proper foresight study. This paper begins to close this gap by analyzing and comparing different schools of thought and updating the literature with the most current tools and methods. Data mining techniques are used to identify articles through an extensive literature review. Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques are used to identify and analyze leading journals, articles, and researchers.

In an empirical demonstration, we investigate experts' views and perceptions of possible future disruption caused by digitalization in an established machine-building industry. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed method in detecting future worldviews of experts grouped by their position in the value chain. The results show polarized responses, with considerable clustering among groups. For example, respondents who were inclined to view digital technologies as disruptive (i.e., as changing the paradigm of value creation in machine-building) also viewed them as related more to service and business models than to products and operation. We discuss the theoretical and practical contributions of the proposed method and suggest fruitful avenues for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;"Disruptive technologies; Industry transformation; Strategy formation; Technology foresight; Visual analogue scale";"Sommarberg, M.; Tampere University of Technology, PO BOX 541, Finland; email: matti.sommarberg@tut.fi";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

However, potentially disruptive technologies often struggle to significantly influence practice. One prominent example is additive manufacturing (AM). Although AM is often regarded as the next great technological revolution in waiting, it has not yet established itself on a large scale in many fields of application. We investigate the reasons behind those challenges by looking at the various fields in which AM is applied and relating them to the specific challenges AM faces, as well as the opportunities it offers in those fields. Our findings rely on a multi-perspective technology foresight process that is based on a discourse analytic approach and that comprises data tomography covering the biggest German-language online magazine on AM and qualitative interview data collected from a range of AM stakeholders. The findings provide an empirically well-founded evaluation and explanation of the link between the challenges and opportunities offered by AM and the extent to which this disruptive technology is leveraged in specific fields. The findings prompt recommendations on how new potentially disruptive technologies can foster abundance in traditional, well established market economies based on the example of the well-developed but traditional market economy of Austria. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;"3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Discourse analysis; Technology foresight";"Gartner, J.; Department of Management Studies, Aalto University School of BusinessFinland; email: Johannes.gartner@aalto.fi";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The uncertainty about future developments is the cause of curiosity and anxiety. Uncertainty can be seen as a challenge in terms of risk and opportunity. In order to deal with uncertainties in an enlightened, prudent and open-minded manner, we need a good sense of temporality and the interaction of human activities. A multiperspective approach and handling of uncertainties (use of scenarios) allows a complex view of uncertainty and overcomes the myopia of common means of reducing uncertainty, such as forecasts. It is precisely in times of doubt and anxiety about the future that uncertainty should lead us to conceive of the future as something that may be shaped. Foresight as an applied and professional set of skills has the potential, through its communication function, to develop alternative strategies to deal with uncertainties.;"Scenarios; Strategic foresight; Uncertainty";"Gabriel, J.; Foresight Intelligence (DE), Donaustrasse 6, Germany; email: johannes.gabriel@foresightintelligence.de";Schweizerischer Forstverein;367818;;;;German;Schweiz.

Dye-sensitized solar cells are a promising third-generation photovoltaic technology that can add functionality and lower costs to enhance the value proposition of solar power generation in the early years of the 21st century. Through a series of technological forecasting studies analyzing the R&D patterns and trends in Dye-sensitized solar cells technology over the past several years, we have come to realize that validating previous forecasts is useful for improving ST&I policy processes. Yet, rarely do we revisit forecasts or projections to ascertain how well they fared. Moreover, few studies pay much attention to assessing FTA techniques. In this paper, we compare recent technology activities with previous forecasts to reveal the influencing factors that led to differences between past predictions and actual performance. Beyond our main aim of checking accuracy, in this paper we also wish to gain some sense of how valid those studies were and whether they proved useful to others in some ways. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); Research evaluation; Technology emergence; Technology forecasting; Technology foresight";"Guo, Y.; School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of TechnologyChina; email: guoying_bit@163.com";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Today, in particular, the safety and security of the built environment focuses on city planning. New technologies, including digitalisation, as well as citizens with differing feelings about and experiences of safety and security challenge city planners, and this requires attention. Utilising foresight methods, such as the participatory scenario-building method, is one way to adapt to future changes in urban settlements and help decision-makers in creating a better tomorrow for citizens. This paper presents one foresight method, termed scenario-building process, as a tool for city planners to create a safer and more secure built environment for citizens with different needs and backgrounds. The paper discusses how to use participatory scenario building together with city authorities and other stakeholders for planning urban areas. By presenting a case study from Finland, where the method was used to develop the area around a railway junction station, the paper brings out four scenarios developed to visualise possible future paths of the studied railway station area. The case study was part of the HARMONISE—A Holistic Approach to Resilience and Systematic Actions to Make Large-Scale Built Infrastructure Secure—project that was funded by the European Union within the Framework Programme 7. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.;"City planning; Foresight; Resilience; Safety; Scenario";"Molarius, R.; VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland LtdFinland; email: riitta.molarius@vtt.fi";Springer;2365757X;;;;English;Urban Book Ser.;2-s2.0-85060723213;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sorokin during the period of the Russian political collapse of 1917-18, as well as the possibility of adapting his «sociology of the revolution» to studies of the transformation of the contemporary socio-political system of the Russian Federation. The author reveals the dependence of P. Sorokin's «stronger scientific approach» to studying the course of the February and October coups of 1917 and predicting their consequences on his ideological beliefs and party positions. In this context, the example of P. Sorokin is seen as a reason for understanding the causes of the distemper in Russia and the responsibility of sociological science for the reliability of political forecasts. The article highlights the connection between political positivism and operative masonry of P.A. Sorokin. His case shows that political foresight can be fundamentally untenable, but, nevertheless, instrumental from the point of view of achieving parties or groups goals. © 2018 Russian Academy of Sciences.

However, this benefit can only be realized when customers can determine the right size of the resources required and allocate such resources in a cost-effective way. While resource over-provisioning can cost users more than necessary, resource under provisioning hurts application performance. To leverage the potential of clouds, a major concern, hence is optimizing the monetary cost spent in using cloud resources while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) and meeting deadlines. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of a good understanding of such cost optimization. The resource provisioning, from the cloud-user perspective, is a complicated optimization problem that consists of much uncertainty, as well as heterogeneity in its parameters. The variety of pricing plans further complicates this problem. There has been little work on solving this problem as it is in the real world and from the end users view. Most works relax the problem by not considering the dynamicity or heterogeneity of the environment. The aim of this paper, however, is optimizing the operational cost whilst guaranteeing performance and meeting deadline constraints, by taking into account parameters' uncertainty and heterogeneity, as well as considering all three available pricing plans, i.e. on-demand, reservation, and spot pricing. The experimental implementation using a real cloud workload shows that, however the proposed model has not the perfect foresight of future; results are very close or in many cases similar to, the full knowledge model. We also analyse the results of various users with different workload pattern, based on a k-means clustering. © 2018 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The goal is to develop foresight—insight into how and why the future could be different than today—to improve policy, planning, and decision making. Scores of futures research methods have been developed or adapted from other disciplines, beginning with pioneering work in the US military and RAND Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s. But many social scientists and natural resource professionals are unaware of these methods and most have never heard of futures research as a distinct field of study. This paper presents a framework for categorizing futures research methods, reviews selected methods, and provides examples of their application to natural resource and environmental issues. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.;"Futures research; methodological pluralism; methods; strategic foresight";"Bengston, D.N.; USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, 1992 Folwell Avenue, United States; email: david.bengston@usda.gov";Routledge;8941920;;;;English;Soc.

Such data is recorded in the form of log files, which records user events that range from simple keystrokes on a computer, user activated sensor data or duration/frequency of phone calls. These interactions can provide rich datasets amenable to user data analytics using machine learning and other analytics techniques. This data analysis can highlight usage patterns and user behaviours based on their interaction with the technology. User log data analysis can be descriptive statistics (what users have done), predictive analytics (what events will happen) and prescriptive (what action to take given a predicted event or outcome). This can also be thought of as spanning across different levels of user analytics from hindsight, insight and foresight. Predictive analytics are used with log data to provide predictions on future user behaviour based on early usage behaviours. Event logs are objective regarding usage, but usage may not correlate with the level of the system's user experience. Hence, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of the user experience can be used augment user log data. Nevertheless, with the emergence of health applications and other app-based health services, we consider how user event logs can be specifically used within the mental health domain. This can provide beneficial insights into how users interact with mental health e-services, which can provide an indication of their current and future mental state. © Dupré et al.

Researchers usually use academic papers and patent data to identify and monitoring the trends of emerging technologies from a technological perspective, but they rarely make use of social media data (e.g., such as Twitter data) related to emerging technologies. Analysis of this social media data is of great significance to understand the emergence of emerging technologies and gain insight into development trends. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that uses patent analysis and Twitter data mining to monitoring the emergence of emerging technologies and identify changing trends of these emerging technologies. The perovskite solar cell technology is selected as a case study. In this case, we used patent analysis to monitoring the evolutionary path of perovskite solar cell technology. We applied Twitter data mining to analyze Twitter users’ sense of, response to, and expectations for this perovskite solar cell technology. We also identified the professional types of Twitter users and examined changes in their topics of interest over time to track the emergence of perovskite solar cell technology. We analyzed a comparison of the results of patent analysis and Twitter data mining to identify development trends of perovskite solar cell technology. This paper contributes to our understanding of how technologies emerge and develop, as well as the technology forecasting and foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic technology R&D experts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;"Emerging technologies; Patent analysis; Perovskite solar cell technology; Technologies emerge; Technology trends; Twitter data mining";"Li, X.; College of Economics and Management, Beijing University of TechnologyChina; email: lixinyz@bjut.edu.cn";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Among the methodologies that effectively support these processes, it is necessary to indicate the following tools: future research, with particular emphasis on foresight, as well as technology assessment and executive capacity assessment. State-of-the-art analyses and the author's practical experience resulting from execution of innovative projects have demonstrated usefulness of individual applications of the indicated tools for the purposes of supporting innovation processes. They also allowed for identification of areas of potential mutual complementarity of tools in question. Recognising legitimacy of a fully integrated use of selected tools to support innovation processes, the author has conducted in-depth literature studies aimed at identifying theoretical models and practical examples of the combined application of the indicated tools. The analysis showed that the joint use of tools, i.e. foresight, technology assessment, and executive capacity assessment in R&D organisations aimed at support for the processes of generation, development, and implementation of innovations is the subject of few scientific analyses and only a limited number of practical applications. Their majority comprise joint use of two out of three analysed tools, which is usually future research and technology assessment. The article presents examples in this area, including attempts to develop specialised models and propose approaches to the joint application of selected tools and practical examples of the joint use of selected tools. The author indicates possible areas of the integrated use of the indicated triad of tools, both at the macro level concerning the economy and at the micro level, in relation to entities participating in the innovation processes, including mainly R&D organisations. Against this background, the author proposes development of an original methodology of supporting processes of generation and realisation of technological innovations. The methodology is based on the application of a triad of tools in an integrated and comprehensive manner. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

One of the main reasons for the rapid growth of the shale oil production in the US was the development of extracting technologies, which reduced the cost of production to an acceptable level. This article studies the problems of long-term forecasting in shale oil production and the productivity of drilling rigs. This research applies the fitting of an asymmetric bell-shaped function using an OLS approach. This function is derived as an analytical solution of the differential equation for oil production. Another innovation of this study is the asymmetric function, which correlates better with data on the extraction of traditional and non-traditional oil resources. An analysis of the empirical data with the derived asymmetrical bell-shaped curve shows that the productivity of drilling rigs will peak by 2026 at 1,200 bbl per day, which is 2 times higher than the current level. The peak of production would correspond to the maximum oil production of 11.3 mln bbl per day and to technically recoverable resources of 96 bln bbl. This could mean that starting from 2023, the volume of shale oil production in the US may not be enough to meet the growing global demand for oil and other resources with even higher production costs should be developed. The theoretically grounded and practically tested asymmetrical bell-shaped curve can serve as one of the tools for assessing the long-term impact of technological innovation and the growth of equipment productivity upon the development of oil production in the US in the course of Foresight studies. © 2018, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

For unanticipated events, organisms have evolved stereotyped motor behaviors mapped to the statistical regularities of the environment, which can be trigged by specific sensory stimuli. These ""reflexive"" responses are more or less hardwired to prevent falls and represent, maybe, the best available solution to maintaining posture given limited available time and information. With the gift of foresight, however, motor behaviors can be tuned or prepared in advance, improving the ability of the organism to compensate for, and interact with, the changing environment. Indeed, foresight's improvement of our interactive capacity occurs through several means, such as better action selection, processing, and conduction delay compensation and by providing a prediction with which to compare our actual behaviors to, thereby facilitating error identification and learning. Here we review the various roles foresight (prediction) plays in maintaining our postural equilibrium. We start by describing some of the more recent findings related to the prediction of instability. Specifically, we cover recent advancements in the understanding of anticipatory postural behaviors that are used broadly to stabilize volitional movement and compensate for impending postural disturbances. We also describe anticipatory changes in the state, or set, of the nervous system that may facilitate anticipatory behaviors. From changes in central set, we briefly discuss prediction of postural instability online before moving into a discussion of how predictive mechanisms, such as internal models, permit us to tune, perhaps our highest level predictive behaviors, namely the priming associated with motor affordances. Lastly, we explore methods best suited to expose the contribution of prediction to postural equilibrium control across a variety of contexts.

Current research methods for probing the future of markets and society rely mainly on expert judgment (i.e. Delphi), imagery or simulation of possible futures (i.e. scenario and simulation) and perspective taking (i.e. role-playing). The predominant focus on cognitive abstraction limits the insights researchers can extract from more embodied, sensorial and experiential approaches. Design/methodology/approach: LARPnography is a qualitative method seeking to immerse participants within a plausible future to better understand the social and market dynamics that may unfold therein. Through careful planning, design, casting and fieldwork, researchers create the preconditions to let participants experience what the future may be and gather critical insights from naturalistic observations and post-event interviews. Practical implications: Owing to its interactive nature and processual focus, LARPnography is best suited to investigate the adoption and diffusion of innovation, market emergence phenomena and radical societal changes, including the rise of alternative societies. Originality/value: Different from previous foresight methods, LARPnography creates immersive and perceptually stimulating replicas of plausible futures that research participants can inhabit. The creation of a fictional yet socio-material world ensures that socially constructed meaning is enriched by phenomenological and visceral insights. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Delphi method; Embodied embedded cognition; Ethnography; Futures and foresight; Live-action role-playing (LARP); Scenario method";"Orazi, D.C.; Monash UniversityAustralia; email: davide.orazi@monash.edu";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;3090566;;;;English;Eur.

Morphological analysis provides a structured method for ensuring consistency and relevance in scenario development. This paper outlines a method for characterizing the entire solution space of future outcomes in a given subject field, and suggests a process for classification of an all-encompassing and mutually exclusive set of scenario classes. The method is illustrated with an example case, taken from Norwegian defense planning, of establishing a scenario set that encompasses all external security challenges to Norway as a security actor. Four parameters are defined – Actor, Goal, Method and Means. Each parameter is defined in terms of an exhaustive set of possible states or values. A Cross Consistency Assessment is conducted to exclude solutions deemed to be impossible on either purely logical grounds (internal consistency) or based on real world assessments (external consistency). Six scenario classes are defined: Strategic Attack, Limited Attack, Coercive Diplomacy, Terrorist Attack, Criminality and Military Peace-time Operations. © 2017 The Author;"Defense planning; Foresight; General Morphological Analysis; Scenario";;Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Many new trends steer the evolution of space activities. Development of commercial space, with start-ups and space ventures, is one of the most visible trends in space. Stimulated by the first initiatives related to space tourism, access to space and the growing use of small satellites, space activities have attracted new entrepreneurs, both start-ups and big web actors with substantial investment capacity. This revolution started in the Silicon Valley and spread worldwide. Start-ups have attracted around $18.4 billion of investment since 2000. It is far below the annual institutional budgets but the pace gained momentum since 2006 and specially 2012. Between teenage crisis and age of reason: new space is now oldâ€¦ The first start-ups shall confirm their promises, while new players pop up and try to find their way. It shakes the legacy players but those demonstrate resilience and adaptation capacity. It is now the right time to take stock of the first lessons learnt. Start-ups disrupt established industry? Instead of a simplistic shortcut, this paper reports an â€œorganisational ecologyâ€ study. Its ambition is to help understanding complex evolutions in the space ecosystem. The first part of the paper introduces the current ecosystem, its actors, the main trends and the five main types of activities (going to space, down to Earth, space in space, far from Earth and the space meccano). Through facts and figures on technology, investments and markets, the second part reviews how â€œnew spaceâ€ trends is preparing the advent of big space.The third part analyses one specific segment, with a deeper dive in Earth Observation and Telecommunications: new initiatives and strategies, market evolution. This sector is particularly relevant: it includes both institutional and commercial markets and new actors are either small but ambitious start-ups or big companies backed by powerful investors.The last part is a foresight exercise, discussing possible evolutions and impacts, threats and opportunities. The decisive role of institutional actors and the Â« new NewspaceÂ» with more and more spacefaring nations is also highlighted. It is clear that something big is happening in space. It is too early to depict the new landscape. While opening new academic questions, this preliminary study shows that the future picture will not be black and white but more colourful with nuances depending on markets, regional specificities and national policies. At the end of the day, the size and the age of the company are less important than its agility, its mindset, its ability to manage risks in complex projects and to cooperate with other commercial and institutional actors. A big vision for the future, from entrepreneurs or from nations, is also needed. © 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

To adopt the right technologies, policy makers should have adequate information about present and future advances. This study aimed to review and compare studies with a focus on the future of health information technology.METHOD: This review study was completed in 2015. The databases used were Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Ovid Medline, and PubMed. Keyword searches were used to identify papers and materials published between 2000 and 2015. Initially, 407 papers were obtained, and they were reduced to 11 papers at the final stage. The selected papers were described and compared in terms of the country of origin, objective, methodology, and time horizon.RESULTS: The papers were divided into two groups: those forecasting the future of health information technology (seven papers) and those providing health information technology foresight (four papers). The results showed that papers related to forecasting the future of health information technology were mostly a literature review, and the time horizon was up to 10 years in most of these studies. In the health information technology foresight group, most of the studies used a combination of techniques, such as scenario building and Delphi methods, and had long-term objectives.CONCLUSION: To make the most of an investment and to improve planning and successful implementation of health information technology, a strategic plan for the future needs to be set. To achieve this aim, methods such as forecasting the future of health information technology and offering health information technology foresight can be applied. The forecasting method is used when the objectives are not very large, and the foresight approach is recommended when large-scale objectives are set to be achieved. In the field of health information technology, the results of foresight studies can help to establish realistic long-term expectations of the future of health information technology.;"forecast; foresight; future research; health information technology";;;15594122;;;28566991;English;Perspect Health Inf Manag;2-s2.0-85045058700;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although there is a vast literature dealing with the classification and development of technology foresight methods (TFMs), the problem of selecting those that best reflect the characteristics of an organization is challenging and remains mostly overlooked. We propose a TFM evaluation procedure that allows decision makers and managers to successfully address this problem. The proposed procedure identifies the most relevant TFMs and organizational criteria and uses them in a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) model to select the most suitable method(s) for implementation. The proposed MCA model combines the doubling data technique with a row principal scoring procedure to allow for the reduction of dimensionality and, consequently, the graphical analysis of the patterns of relationships among TFMs and evaluation criteria. We present a case study in a knowledge-based organization to demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed evaluation procedure. The results show that the proposed model can be properly adapted to allow for a wide range of applications involving business organizations and government agencies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;"Evaluation and selection; Extrapolation method; Multiple correspondence analysis; Quantitative and qualitative criteria; Technology development; Technology foresight";"Tavana, M.; Business Systems and Analytics Department, La Salle UniversityUnited States; email: tavana@lasalle.edu";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The emphasis IFCs have placed on non-partisanship, transparency and forecasting is viewed as reflecting a particular understanding of the problem of public debt and a limited understanding of the future and policy making. Located within the context of increasing technocratic tendencies, it is argued that IFCs can be seen as part of efforts to secure the de-politicisation of policy making. Attempts to secure the de-politicisation of policy making may at best, be considered laudable, but naïve, and at worst, represents an ideological sleight of hand in attempts to colonise the future. Moving forward, it is argued that strategic foresight can make a vital contribution to an open form of policy making that deepens and extends an understanding of what the future could be - the necessary ficta of policy making. © 2017, The Author(s).;"De-politicisation; Forecasts; Foresight; Non-partisanship; Technocracy";"Connor, S.; University of Wolverhampton, Institute of Community and Society, Room 204, Millennium City Building, City Campus Wulfruna Street, United Kingdom; email: stuart.connor@wlv.ac.uk";Springer Berlin Heidelberg;21954194;;;;English;European J.

From the perspective of sustaining soil functions, this implies the integration of soil productivity with the other soil functions and services, namely carbon sequestration, water purification and retention, and nutrient and matter cycling as well as biodiversity. Soil management is the key to this integration. The proper anticipation of future opportunities and challenges for sustainable soil management requires an analysis of drivers and trends affecting soil management. Here, we review drivers and trends of soil management and their relevance for soil functions taking Germany as an example of industrialized agricultural systems with low yield gaps. We analyzed socio-economic, biophysical and technological drivers and identified two types of future management changes: (1) Quantitative changes, i.e., more or less of the same input factors, such as fertilizers, as part of a moderate intensification. (2) Qualitative changes: There, we found the strongest signals for the following practices: higher precision and lightweight machines triggered by information and communication technology (ICT) and robotics; diversification of crop rotations, including the integration of lignocellulosic crops; inoculation with biota; and new crop varieties. Positive practices may be reinforced by a behavioral trend towards sustainable soil management, driven by increasing awareness, knowledge, and consumer demand. They offer opportunities for relieving mechanical pressures from weight and contact stress, chemical pressures from pesticides and fertilizers and promoting soil biodiversity without compromising the soil’s production function. We also found threats, such as increased removal of organic residues and potentially harmful organisms. This foresight study is the first to delineate opportunities and challenges for sustainable soil management and intensification. It informs researchers who intend to improve the knowledge base for reinforcement of positive and mitigation of negative trends of soil management. © 2017, The Author(s).";"Cropping systems; Drivers of agronomic trends; Foresight; Soil management; Sustainable intensification";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The concept of modular roadmapping is illustrated by the example of a huge roadmapping project accompanying the innovation alliance “Lithium-ion batteries LIB 2015”, carried out by Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, Karlsruhe, and funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany. The roadmapping framework addresses a broad technology landscape covering three focal domains: (i) Energy storage with lithium-ion battery technologies in general, addressing all kinds of corresponding battery applications, (ii) energy storage for electric mobility and (iii) stationary energy storage specifically. Each domain is represented and specified through a certain technology roadmap covering technological developments, a product roadmap assessing corresponding market trends and product requirements, and an integrated, unified roadmap linking technology push and market pull in a broader integrated view. In order to further specific insights for next generations of batteries in the above-mentioned roadmapping project, modularity for integrated roadmapping helps to systematically link expertise on technologies, products, applications, markets and society in regards to overarching (inter-)national challenges (e.g. the German energy transition). Every roadmap forms an independent module for itself, showing different paths of future development and critical dependencies in each of the three highly dependent but also highly complex domains mentioned. Yet only through the integration of all perspectives in technologies, products, applications, markets and society, the aim of analyzing and documenting changes of innovation systems as a whole can be accomplished. From an academic perspective, a modular design approach in roadmapping contributes to more conceptual clarity, especially when providing roadmaps for a technology-driven innovation system with a core technology in the focus and multiple other competing or complementary technologies around. From a practitioner's point of view, guidance is provided on how to link developments and progression made in basic and applied science, industrial R&D and socio-political trends, for current and emerging technologies and applications. The experience made and insights from various stakeholders involved in this roadmapping project are of interest and relevance for all actors, be they from science, industry or policy, as they may trigger the development of existing and emergence of new industries. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Electric mobility; Energy storage; Innovation system; Lithium-ion battery; Modularity; Roadmapping";"Sauer, A.; Competence Center Emerging Technologies, Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, Breslauer Straße 48, Germany; email: andreas.sauer@isi.fraunhofer.de";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Technology foresight is a well-established discipline, practised with popular foresight methods such as roadmapping and scenario planning. Applying each foresight method reveals limitations in practice, some of which can be addressed by combining methods. Following calls for combining foresight methods, and past attempts to integrate scenario planning and technology roadmapping, we propose a novel method for their combination. The resulting method — ‘scenario-driven roadmapping’ differs in: i) using scenario planning first to identify plausible images of the general environment and then using the scenarios for technology roadmapping; and ii) taking advantage of ‘flex points’ – critical developments which would signal transitions along particular pathways – to create a ‘radar’ to support effective monitoring of the environment over time. This new combined method takes advantage of the strengths of both methods, while addressing their limitations. A case study vignette centred on the work of a special interest group for Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology adoption in the English National Health Service is presented to illustrate and reflect upon the use in practice of the ‘scenario-driven roadmapping’ method. Participants were able to develop a detailed technology roadmap with clear ‘flex points’ helping to connect present circumstances with pathways towards future scenarios.

This study examines the relative perceived importance of several megatrends in the context of cadastral systems. In addition, we discuss the implications of relevant megatrends for the Finnish cadastral system and synthesize the anticipated impacts into key points. Our results are based on a two-round Delphi survey among Finnish experts in cadastral systems. The respondents identified digital culture, ubiquitous intelligence, and a tendency towards transparency, accessibility, and open data as the most important megatrends shaping the future of the Finnish cadastral system. Technological megatrends were also expected to have major impacts on the Finnish cadastral system by 2035. According to the panel technological advances will shape user preferences in the future. They anticipate that new forms of public services and collaboration between the public and private sectors in producing cadastral information will emerge by 2035.

We then describe our approach, which includes developing scenarios and alternative strategies separately and supporting the strategy selection through an integrated assessment of the goal-based efficacy and robustness. To facilitate the collaborative strategizing in teams, we propose a matrix with robustness and efficacy as the two axes, which we call the Parmenides Matrix.

This approach is adapted from the French “La Prospective”. It is used as an action research engaging local farming communities in expanding their understanding of their own futures. Three cases of local implementation at farmer community level in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines illustrate how this approach was implemented. They are part of a global project in the field of food, agriculture and rural development, aiming at balancing the capacity to use the future, which is currently not fairly distributed to the detriment of local stakeholders, organizations and communities. Our results focus on the emergence of futures literacy as a capability, its connection to local agency and societal transformation. Our discussion highlights what in this approach makes the use of scenarios empowering, beyond its participatory features. The capacity to use the future has a great potential for local agency, even if it does not guarantee that communities will have the power or the willingness to directly engage in actions. Nevertheless, this approach seems to be a promising avenue for making everyone a future-literate potential agent of change. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;"Capability; Co-elaboration; Futures literacy; Local agency; Rural development; Scenario";"Bourgeois, R.; French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR), c/o FAO-DDNG, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, Italy; email: robin.bourgeois@cirad.fr";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The context for examining organisational anticipation is one of ontological insecurity; raising issues of epistemological and therefore methodological uncertainty. The paper draws on re-emerging areas of study in the futures literature especially with respect to anticipatory systems and post-normal science. Rosen's 1985 theory of anticipatory systems is not well known, though has received recent attention as part of a growing discourse on Anticipation, for example as a possible discipline and as a form of governance. For Rosen, causality is mediated through a modelling relationship between actor and environment which entails causality, not by the direct effect of the environment on the actor. The paper discusses the implications of this perspective on the role of scenario planning in organisations, which is but one of multiple anticipatory systems at work in the organisation and hence often weak in power. The argument is further developed by considering ‘modelling relations’ which are inherent to active anticipatory systems. The conclusion is that in human social systems in uncertain environments require approaches to anticipation that recognise the multiplicity of modelling relations. One approach to this has been set out in earlier work by Funtowicz and Ravetz (1993), which they called post-normal science. The paper concludes by suggesting that the epistemology of anticipatory systems and methodology developed from PNS might be used to reduce Cartesian anxiety with respect to ontological insecurities of uncertain times. This has radical implications for scenario planning as it is currently conceived. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.";"Anticipatory Systems; Futures; Modelling relations; Post-normal science; Robert Rosen; Scenario methods; Scenario planning; Strategic foresight";"Fuller, T.; Lincoln Business School, University of Lincoln, Brayford Pool, United Kingdom; email: tfuller@lincoln.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The uncertainty that is created around product and project activities generates a substantial challenge for accurate software estimation. Hence, in recent years researchers have proposed various approaches that are exceptionally capable of handling uncertainty as to effort, duration and general velocity prediction based on data mining algorithms. Nevertheless, the agile state of current software project environments requires an even more sophisticated approach which is not only related to predictions but rather to prescriptive or even cognitive analytics, machine learning, scenario planning and foresight. This article aims to define a direction in which further research of applications of data mining and machine learning for software estimation may progress. This is achieved by proposing various use cases for prescriptive analytics that aim to enhance software estimation, optimize resources utilization, improve product quality and ultimately increase probability of successful project completion. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.;"Advanced analytics; Duration estimation; Effort; Machine learning; Prescriptive analytics; Software estimation; Software maintenance; Software quality";;Association for Computing Machinery;;9,78E+12;;;English;ACM Int.

Based on interviews conducted over the 2016–2017 school year with a team of data professionals employed by a Charter Management Organization (CMO) that operates one dozen schools in South and East Los Angeles, this paper shows that respondents endorse a range of views about how data can stand in for things, events, and people. Data professionals charged with the creation and management of student-level data expressed views consistent with a representationalist understanding of digital data; by contrast, those charged chiefly with aggregating and analyzing heterogeneous streams of data expressed greater skepticism toward representationalist commitments. Despite this heterogeneous set of views, all of the data professionals interviewed relied on the same medium to communicate their interpretations of data to other members of the organization, including school personnel: a bespoke platform that consists of 125 dashboards.

This work aspires to render a contribution within the domain of strategic management forecasting, through the indicative case of European maritime clusters. For this end, a two-tier model is formulated. A quantitative strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) methodology that derives from the fusion of a quondam situation analysis and crosstabs’ theory is generated. This leads to the utilization of the crosstab’s conditional probabilities as transition probabilities; the latter are called to compile the transition matrix of a Markov chain. Through this methodology, and the successive Markov chain’s transition matrices, strategic forecasts are extracted for a devised European maritime cluster case. This work relinquishes a novel application with respect to strategic management forecasting, that provides a dichotomy of practical interpretations and scenarios for quantitative situation analysis. Thus, it may enable effective real-time decision-making for strategic management and/or policy drafting. The situation analysis forecasting model may find applicability in a plethora of practical and theoretical cases, wherein forecasting may be desirable. It may as well pertain to an intrinsic methodology for situation analysis forecasting of maritime clusters. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"forecasting model; industry cluster; maritime cluster; Markov chain; strategic foresight; Strategic management";"Stavroulakis, P.J.; Department of Maritime Studies, University of Piraeus, Karaoli & Dimitriou St. 80, Greece; email: pjstav@unipi.gr";Routledge;3088839;;;;English;Marit.

The increase in the number of suppliers that use renewable energy resources introduces new challenges in scheduling and dispatching controllable resources to control the load of the power grid in the system. By using the pricing method that maximizes social welfare, consumers/suppliers can determine the optimal power consumption/generation that maximizes own welfare. However, when a forecast error of renewable energy output occurs, the gap between the total power consumption and generation causes unless consumers decrease power consumption from the optimal consumption. Decreasing consumers' power consumption might lower their utility. In this paper, we define impact on consumers' utility and propose two demand response methods which aim to minimize the impact. The first method, called One-Time Demand Response, minimizes the impact on consumers' utility of a certain time slot by using a Lagrange multiplier. In the second method, called Foresight Demand Response, all consumers can forecast the electricity market price of the next time slot by using linear regression, and consumers do not reduce power consumption when the incentive of a certain time slot is cheaper than the forecast electricity market price of the next time slot. From the performance evaluation, we confirm the impact on consumers' utility in One-Time Demand Response and Foresight Demand Response. We also confirm that both two proposals can increase consumers' welfare compared to not carrying out demand response. © 2017 IEEE.;;;IEEE Computer Society;19440367;9,78E+12;;;English;IEEE Workshop Local Metrop.

One important and challenging aspect in such collaborative foresight projects is the selection of suitable partners, which is analyzed in this paper. We do so based on existing literature and by an action research study: this collaborative foresight project was conducted by the project initiators (Linz Center of Mechatronics Ltd. (LCM) and Institute of Strategic Management, Johannes Kepler University Linz (ISM)) in cooperation with five companies. The results show that there are - due to the objectives of collaborative foresight (e.g. joint creation of future knowledge and “out-of-the-box-thinking”) - special requirements regarding technological and organizational proximity, trust and commitment. Related to technological resources we claim that a higher degree of diversity is crucial and organizational proximity is less important. In this way unique learning opportunities can be created and opportunities for new ideas can be generated. However, the companies have to be similar enough to facilitate learning and to anticipate future developments. In addition, we suppose that geographical proximity is very helpful in bringing the organizations together and facilitating the exchange of tacit knowledge. Furthermore, the results show that criteria such as trust and commitment, often referred to as key factors, are of little relevance in this context. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;"Collaborative foresight; Foresight; Networked foresight; Open foresight; Partner selection";Gattringer, R.email: regina.gattringer@jku.at;Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In every reappraisal period of the foresight strategies, each agent chooses only one among three predictors (naive, adaptive and VAR) to forecast the monthly inflation rate. The predictor selection process is modeled as a discrete choice dynamics based on two attributes, namely, accuracy less the average cost predictor (private attributes) and dispersion in cognitive abilities. The calibrated agent-based computational model shows that heterogeneity in inflation expectations is persistent, that is, less accurate predictors coexist with the most accurate predictor due to the dispersion in cognitive abilities of agents. © 2017, Instituto de Pesquisas Economicas da FEA-USP.

Nevertheless, they systematically overestimate the intensity of their future emotional reactions relative to how they feel when these events actually occur. The developmental origin of this “intensity bias” has not yet been examined. Two studies were conducted to test the intensity bias in preschool children. In the first study, 5-year-olds (N = 30) predicted how they would feel if they won or lost various games. Comparisons with subsequent self-reported feelings indicated that participants overestimated how sad they would feel to lose the games but did not overestimate their happiness from winning. The second study replicated this effect in another sample of 5-year-olds (n = 34) and also found evidence of an intensity bias in 4-year-olds (n = 30). These findings provide the first evidence of a negative intensity bias in affective forecasting among young children. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;"Affective forecasting; Children; Development; Foresight; Impact bias; Mental time travel; Prospection";"Gautam, S.; School of Psychology, University of QueenslandAustralia";Academic Press Inc.;220965;;JECPA;28288413;English;J.

At the outset, the purpose of these efforts is to investigate emerging S&T areas, set priorities and inform policies and strategies. However, there is still no clear evidence on the mutual linkage between science and strategy, which may be attributed to Foresight and S&T policy making activities. The present paper attempts to test the hypothesis that both science and strategy affect each other and this linkage can be investigated quantitatively. The evidence for the mutual attribution of science and strategy is built on a quantitative trend monitoring process drawing on semantic analysis of large amount of textual data and text mining tools. Based on the proposed methodology the similarities between science and strategy documents along with the overlaps between them across a certain period of time are calculated using the case of the Agriculture and Food sector, and thus the linkages between science and strategy are investigated. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.;"Agriculture and food sector; Foresight; Science and strategy; Science push; Semantic similarity; Strategy pull; Tech mining; Text mining; Trend analysis";"Saritas, O.; Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge, National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: osaritas@hse.ru";Springer Netherlands;1389130;;;;English;Scientometrics;2-s2.0-85015612100;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper, based on an analysis of global technology foresight features, systematically summarizes and discusses academic studies, governmental practices, and policy applications regarding technology foresight in China, associated with bibliometrics, expert interviews, and desk research methods. The evidence of both theoretical studies and practical activities indicates that technology foresight has rapidly developed in China. This development process can be divided into three periods: the exploration, rapid development, and maturation periods. Technology foresight activities in China enable stakeholders to consult with each other, which leads to a technology foresight culture. Further, many problems in developing and planning with science, technology, and innovation can be solved when comprehensive approaches are adopted to conduct technology foresight activities, including large-scale Delphi survey, scenario analysis, technology roadmap, and bibliometrics, among others. Currently, technology foresight is not only an essential instrument, but is also widely applied in China to develop planning and policies regarding science, technology, and innovation activities. Alternatively, the methodology of Chinese technology foresight and its application to science and technology planning must further improve. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Academic studies; China; Governmental practices; Policy applications; Technology foresight";"Chen, K.; Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of ScienceChina; email: chenkaihua@casipm.ac.cn";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Experience from many countries shows that substantial policy decision making requires collecting and analysing a broad range of information to develop proactive and future-oriented policies. Accordingly, infrastructure providing this information as well as evidence for policy-making must possess the capabilities for collecting, assessing, and processing information. However, information in this context is highly specific and subject related information, which is frequently embodied within expert knowledge holders. Therefore, information management in this light imposes special challenges on infrastructure. The present study discusses some methodological approaches and practical studies to set up a network of STI Foresight network in Russia, integrated into the national Foresight and planning system. We outline the principles for goal setting, network architecture, creating a network of experts, selecting key information products, and methodological support.

However, foresight activities have not, by and large, resulted in well-developed policy initiatives. Three factors are relevant for improvement. First, foresight activities would benefit from being more informed by the convergence literature and global convergence experience over the past several decades, and should therefore incorporate organically the concepts of absorptive capacity and technology gap into foresight exercises. Second, certain preconditions – in particular the existence of a functional national innovation system – enhance the likelihood that foresight exercises will be successful. Third, in order to achieve wide buy-in and promote the sustainability of initiatives generated by the foresight activity, developing countries are advised to consult widely in the foresight process.

Shipbuilding has evolved into a high tech industry over the last few decades that is strongly driven by customer needs and wishes. Consequently economic development of the industry is now far more complex than previously. International competition in the shipbuilding industry is very strong in all segments of the industry. The article assesses the future development of the shipbuilding industry globally and evaluates the position and opportunities for Russian shipbuilding. International experience of estimating industries' future development shows that a necessary condition of success is building a vision of the industry's long-term future in the context of social and economic development. One way to create such a long-term vision is through developing scenarios based on factors including wild card events, global challenges, trends, threats, drivers, barriers, and limitations. One of the most effective approaches to enhance competitiveness of the industry is Technology Foresight. The paper presents results of Foresight for civil shipbuilding in Russia on the basis of benchmarking, expert procedures and scenario analysis. It demonstrates how Technology Foresight was adjusted to the special conditions of Russia as an emerging country and how the special features of strategic industries which are in the national interest of countries can be included in Technology Foresight studies. Finally the article derives strategies for policy making to set priorities for revitalizing the industry. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Forecasting; Foresight; Innovation; Priority setting; Russia; Scenarios; Shipbuilding; STI";"Vishnevskiy, K.; National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: kvishnevsky@hse.ru";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Processes of developing future oriented innovation policies are often unsuccessful and rarely inclusive. We conceptualize such processes as foresighting. We focus on how the ex-ante design of policymaking processes affects the actual process with a focus on inclusion, and we discuss how it affects policy effectiveness and innovation system transformation. Our argument is that processes of policymaking must be inclusive to affect and transform innovation systems because a set of distributed actors, rather than ministries and innovation agencies, is the gatekeepers of change. From this perspective, inclusion is a precondition rather than an obstacle for transformation. Based on the notion of innovation system foresight, we develop an analytical framework that we use to study design and processes in foresight cases in two emerging economies: Brazil and South Korea. We conclude that better systemic and innovation oriented foresight is needed to enhance inclusive development. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Emerging economies; Foresight, innovation systems; Inclusive development; Innovation policy";"Andersen, A.D.; Centre for Technology, Innovation and Culture (TIK), Oslo UniversityNorway; email: adahlandersen@gmail.com";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Achieving prominence in Japan and Western Europe, it attracted the attention of researchers and policy analysts in many parts of the world in subsequent decades. TF is often seen as a set of tools for informing decisions about STI priorities within established innovation systems. These priorities have necessarily changed as scientific knowledge, technological opportunities, and social demands have evolved. But so too have the ways in which innovation processes operate, and understandings of the roles that STI policies can play. Accordingly TF has also been applied to inform efforts to restructure innovation systems - and, indeed, it was often seen as also providing tools to assist in such efforts. The need for such restructuring has been particularly acute in countries undergoing massive transitions. These include transitions from centrally planned to market economies, from non-industrial to newly industrialized countries, and from being imitation-oriented to becoming innovation pioneers. Correspondingly, considerable effort has been put into TF in many such countries. But much of this TF effort has been largely invisible, or at best poorly documented. TF may itself require redesign, taking different forms in various contexts, and as experience with the tools has accumulated. This might involve different patterns of emphasis of, and ways of articulating: the methods that are employed; the stakeholders engaged; the linkages with STI policymaking; and so on. Informed by the contents of this Special Issue, this essay considers the issues arising from this diffusion and evolution of practice, outlining the main capabilities required to mount successful TF exercises in different contexts. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.";;"Miles, I.; Manchester Business School, University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

It is desirable in most developing countries to establish coherence between technological forecasting and science, technology, and innovation policies. This study demonstrates that national foresight has disadvantages in implementing such policies because of insufficient monetized information with discriminant power for investment. To compensate for such disadvantages, a logic model is indispensable, and can be achieved by subsequent foresight at the time of each decision rather than by one-time national foresight. The example of the Korean government emphasizes that decision-making involving consecutive value-based technological forecasting can act as an institutional framework to progress from catch-up development to being an advanced economy. Despite a tradition against aggressive R&D investment in Korea, quantitative ex-ante evaluations with a feasible value chain have given the financial authorities' confidence. This is what has made Korea's research boom possible. If developing or transition countries plan to achieve catch-up growth by expanding R&D investment, the institutional cases in this study will be an important reference. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Catch-up development; Innovation policy; Logic model; Research boom; Technological forecasting; Value chain";;Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Over the past decade, China has become an important alternative source of these technologies offering a range of technological choices for small scale and dispersed production of cheap consumer goods, particularly in the developing world. Preceding a national foresight exercise aimed at enhancing the capabilities of small-scale garment producers in Uganda, we examine the potential ‘inclusiveness’ of garment sewing machines imported from the Northern economies and China, and their individual potential to enhance the capabilities of poor garment producers, particularly, women and rural dwellers. Data for our study included a survey and semi-structured interviews with 147 garment firms and other key informants. Compared to the Chinese sewing machines, we found that the Northern machines have high acquisition cost, relies on scale and advanced infrastructure, and tend to exclude poor rural producers (often women). The transfer of Chinese technologies to Uganda, we also found is much easier, have larger spread effects, leading to smaller gaps in technological know-how between China and Uganda because of the context in which Chinese technological innovations are induced.

The case of nanotechnology demonstrated that discourses on those emerging technologies are increasingly shaped by techno-utopian narratives. We argue that these narratives are here to stay, because they are an expression of a contemporary medialization of science and technology. Since the RI community can neither ignore nor escape these techno-utopian narratives, it might engage in a hermeneutic reading of these visions as performative fiction.

With the ability to identify high-potential development directions, science foresight can be a useful tool to support the management and planning of future research activities. Science foresight analysts can choose from a rather large variety of approaches. There is, however, relatively little information about how the various approaches can be applied in an effective way. This paper describes a three-step methodological framework for science foresight on the basis of published research papers, consisting of (i) life-cycle analysis, (ii) text mining and (iii) knowledge gap identification by means of automated clustering. The three steps are connected using the research methodology of the research papers, as identified by text mining. The potential of combining these three steps in one framework is illustrated by analyzing scientific literature on wind catchers; a natural ventilation concept which has received considerable attention from academia, but with quite low application in practice. The knowledge gaps that are identified show that the automated foresight analysis is indeed able to find uncharted research areas. Results from a sensitivity analysis further show the importance of using full-texts for text mining instead of only title, keywords and abstract. The paper concludes with a reflection on the methodological framework, and gives directions for its intended use in future studies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.";"Knowledge gap identification; Life-cycle analysis; Science foresight; Sensitivity analysis; Text mining; Wind catcher";"Rezaeian, M.; Department of Economics, Management and Accounting, Yazd University, P.O. box 89195 - 741, Iran; email: mina.rezaiyan@ymail.com";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In Experiment 1, participants read an essay about baseball or dogs and then answered questions about the baseball essay to the best of their ability, as if they had not read the essay, or to the best of their ability, although they read about dogs. Participants also completed a quiz about baseball rules and terminology, which was an objective measure of expertise. Results demonstrated that as participants' baseball expertise increased, their inability to act as if they never read the essay also increased; expertise exacerbated the hindsight bias. To test the effects of subjective expertise on hindsight bias and investigate factors underlying the relationship, participants in Experiment 2 ranked five topics in order of expertise and gave feeling-of-knowing (FOK) ratings for questions from these topics. Foresight participants then saw each question again and answered the questions; hindsight participants saw the questions and answers and gave the probability they would have known the answers had they not been provided. Hindsight bias increased with subjective expertise as did average FOK ratings. In Experiment 3, we experimentally manipulated perceived expertise but found that neither average FOK ratings nor hindsight bias was affected by experimentally induced expertise. Taken together, the results demonstrate that expertise exacerbates both objective and subjective hindsight bias but that an FOK, which likely exists only when expertise is naturally acquired, is necessary to engender the detrimental effect of expertise on the hindsight bias.

In particular, the question whether the deployment of intelligent systems will be a chance or a threat to mankind has been considered by many researchers recently. This paper is devoted to an estimation of advanced ICT tools impact on the modes and progress of scientific research in various areas. We will present and discuss the development prospects of selected intelligent technologies such as Global Expert Systems (GES), bi-directional Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), or Creativity Support Systems (CSS). The forecasts of their development until 2025 has been presented in a series of papers resulting from a recent ICT foresight project. The above mentioned technologies are supposed to allow scientists to compete with the growing capabilities of intelligent systems to make autonomous decisions in dynamically changing environment. Such systems are referred to as Artificial Autonomous Decision Systems (AADS). We claim that a future scientist endowed with joint capacities of human brain and new technologies will be able to cope with big scientific data growth which exhausts the capacities of any individual researcher. We will present and discuss scenarios that may dominate the development of future scientific methodology. The first one will rely on automation of research, i.e. letting automated expert systems select and process knowledge up to the stage of an edited scientific paper, with relatively minor and ever-decreasing human intervention. The other assumes an intensive development of BCI as an enabling technology for future advanced hybrid intelligent systems. All mitigating approaches are expected to merge, but other optimistic or pessimistic scenarios are also possible. These will be discussed in the Conclusions section of this paper together with recommendations to researchers and R&D policy makers. © 2016 IEEE.;"AI foresight; Anticipatory networks; Brain-computer interfaces; E-science scenarios; Global expert systems";;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;9,78E+12;;;English;Proc. - IEEE Int.

Yet, a staggering wealth of new plankton observations, integrated with recent advances in marine ecosystem modeling, may shed light on marine ecosystem structure and functioning. A EuroMarine foresight workshop on the ""Impact of climate change on the distribution of plankton functional and phylogenetic diversity"" (PlankDiv) identified five grand challenges for future plankton diversity and macroecology research: (1) What can we learn about plankton communities from the new wealth of high-throughput ""omics"" data? (2) What is the link between plankton diversity and ecosystem function? (3) How can species distribution models be adapted to represent plankton biogeography? (4) How will plankton biogeography be altered due to anthropogenic climate change? and (5) Can a new unifying theory of macroecology be developed based on plankton ecology studies? In this review, we discuss potential future avenues to address these questions, and challenges that need to be tackled along the way. © 2017 Chust, Vogt, Benedetti, Nakov, Villéger, Aubert, Vallina, Righetti, Not, Biard, Bittner, Benoiston, Guidi, Villarino, Gaborit, Cornils, Buttay, Irisson, Chiarello, Vallim, Blanco-Bercial, Basconi and Ayata.";"Climate change; Habitat modeling; Macroecology; Plankton; Species distribution, functional diversity";"Chust, G.; Marine Research Division, AZTISpain; email: gchust@azti.es";Frontiers Media S.

This work concentrates on textual data and considers its use in foresight to address new research questions and integrate other stakeholders. This textual data can be accessed and systematically examined through text mining which structures and aggregates data in a largely automated manner. By exploiting new data sources (e.g. Twitter, web mining), more actors and views are integrated, and more emphasis is laid on the analysis of social changes. The objective of this article is to explore the potential of text mining for foresight by considering different data sources, text mining approaches, and foresight methods. After clarifying the potential of combining text mining and foresight, examples are outlined for roadmapping and scenario development. As the results show, text mining facilitates the detection and examination of emerging topics and technologies by extending the knowledge base of foresight. Hence, new foresight applications can be designed. In particular, text mining provides a solid base for reflecting on possible futures. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Big data; Data analysis; Foresight; Roadmapping; Scenario development; Text mining";"Kayser, V.; Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Breslauer Strasse 48, Germany; email: mail@vkayser.de";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Moreover, studies in which the enormous need have existed to design desired futures in natural disaster management have increased as well. In this paper, the authors try to elaborate the relations between ‘disaster management’, ‘risk management’, and ‘disaster risk management’ in Foresight philosophies and fundamental concepts. In this regard, different information has been gathered and analyzed. These include literature review in disaster management, Foresight, and related fields, as well as evidences of Foresight and disaster risk management projects. In addition, global statistical data related to natural disasters have been analyzed. Reviewing global trends of natural disasters reveal that disaster impacts are dramatically increasing. The uncertainties associated with future disasters have grown too. This will certainly surprise decision-makers in future disasters. Furthermore, the key stakeholders, who could apply the Foresight methods in managing natural disasters, are national and international policy-makers. They will have faced with a systematic failure in case of inability to follow a reliable long-term planning. To resolve this problem, there is a need for comprehensive, in-depth review of fundamental concepts of Foresight being specifically applied in managing disasters Considering the concept of the systematic approach to disaster risk management and key concepts of Foresight will respectively show the importance of Foresight in avoiding ‘systematic failures’ in case natural disasters occur. ‘Foresight studies’ are not common in ‘disaster management’ studies, therefore, the information collected and analyzed in this paper is based on theoretical and fundamental concepts of two fields of studies including ‘disaster management’ and ‘Foresight’, as well as available resources of the practical Foresight studies in disaster managing. To improve the insights of the related decision-makers, the common areas, and the key differences between the ‘disaster management’ approach and Foresight are compared. Moreover, the related viewpoints are also discussed after analyzing the basic concepts which can be viewed through Foresight. The results reveal that there are significant conceptual similarities and differences in these two fields of studies. These differences, in some cases, create a simplistic point of view to ‘Foresight’ in planning for disaster prevention. Thus, limited Foresight methods have been used in disaster management so far. To avoid this problem, the conceptual relationships among the Foresight and disaster management are outlined. The position of Foresight in the improvement of disaster management cycle has been identified as well. Disaster management tools are proposed to promote the application of Foresight in disaster management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;"Disaster management; Disaster risk management; Foresight; Futures studies";"Sayah Mofazali, A.; ACECR – Futures Studies Research Group of IHSSIran; email: Ardeshir.sayah@ihss.ac.ir";Elsevier Ltd;22124209;;;;English;Int.

What characterizes the research in this field? To answer this question we undertook a systematic literature review searching two library databases, Business Source Complete and ScienceDirect, for scientific articles related to the topic ´strategic foresight´ in the context of the organization. The search revealed 59 publications published between January 2000 and October 2014. The articles were systematically organized and analyzed. This review provides the status of this emergent research field. Although we witness a growth of academic interest in strategic foresight, we argue that this scientific field is weakly organized and there is a lack of theoretical progress. We have analyzed the research subjects addressed in the 59 articles, and from this a taxonomy of eight categories. Three categories dominate in terms of frequency of articles: methods applied, organizing practices, and experiences gained. There is only limited research on motivation and use, value contribution, and innovation. Explorative research dominates, and a variety of theoretical perspectives has been used. Some attempts to build conceptual foundations can be observed, but in general, we found no single perspective that deserves loyalty on which a coherent theoretical foundation of strategic foresight is built. Strategic foresight has a great potential of contributing more to the success of a firm if the research moves from today's dominating explorative research to also include more explanatory research. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Corporate foresight; Strategic foresight; Systematic literature review; Technology foresight";"Iden, J.; NHH Norwegian School of Economics, Helleveien 30, Norway; email: jon.iden@nhh.no";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

On the one hand, the degree of uncertainty is associated with the objective essence of randomness of the phenomenon, and on the other, with the subjective perspective of a man. Future-oriented perception of human activities is laden with an incomplete specificity of the analysed phenomena, their volatility, and lack of continuity. A man is unable to determine, with complete certainty, the further course of these phenomena. According to the author of this article, in order to significantly reduce the uncertainty while making strategic decisions in a complex environment, we should focus our actions on the future through systemic research of foresight. This article attempts to answer the following research questions: 1) What is the relationship between foresight studies in the system perspective to studies of the uncertainty? 2) What classes of foresight methods enable the research of uncertainty in the process of system inquiry of the future? This study conducted deductive reasoning based on the results of the analysis methods and criticism of literature. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

We chose the milk market as a case study, in line with the recent call from the EU Commission for governance tools which help to better address such highly volatile markets. Furthermore, on the first of April 2015, the new Common Agricultural Policy ended quotas for milk, which led to a milk crisis in the EU. Thus, we collaborated with milk experts to get their inputs for a new model to analyse the competitive environment. Consequently, we constructed graphs to represent the major factors that affect the milk industry and the relationships between them. We obtained several network measures for this social network, such as centrality and density. Some factors appear to have the largest major influence on all the other graph elements, while others strongly interact in cliques. Any detected changes in any of these factors will automatically impact the others. Therefore, scanning ones competitive environment can allow an organisation to get an early warning to help it avoid an issue (as much as possible) and/or seize an opportunity before its competitors. We conclude that Strategic Early Warning Systems as a corporate foresight approach utilising graph theory can strengthen the governance of markets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;"Corporate foresight; Graph theory; Milk market; Scanning; Scenario analysis; Strategic Early Warning System";"Bisson, C.; Department of Management Information Systems, Kadir Has UniversityTurkey; email: cbisson@khas.edu.tr";Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-85011342778;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, its use has been declining as both farm size and climate-related variability in forage have increased. Foresight studies examining food security have found that grasslands play an important role in allowing adjustments under different circumstances. Grazing can be used to ensure farm economic performance, address environmental challenges, and respond to consumer expectations. It is drawing ever increasing attention from the dairy industry and product distributors, as well as from legislators in certain countries. However, we currently lack a proper method for quantifying grazing practices (here, we describe a potential way to estimate the maximum contribution made by grazing to livestock production). We also need to establish shared European-level standards (in Germany and the Netherlands, to be considered grass fed, livestock must graze at least 6 h/day and 120 days/year).;"Basic diet; Change in time; Economic aspect; Estimation method; Europe; Forecast; Grassland; Grazing; New-Zealand; Seasonal variations";;Association Francaise pour la Production Fourragere;4292766;;;;French;Fourrag.;2-s2.0-85020441458;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Shaping of tomorrow is not possible without qualitative analyses. Therefore, the social and psychological dimensions of reality form an important part of technology foresight. Qualitative research will be needed to understand superficial and deep structures of social realities. So called push and pull factors are always linked to social behaviour. People's relationship to the use of technologies and the utilization of technologies is a complex and not a one-dimensional or monological issue. Monological methodological approaches can be harmful and confusing in the field of participatory foresight. We can conclude that the cycles of deductive and inductive logic are needed in science and in participatory foresight studies. Experts of the FTA community must have a higher level of methodological know-how in this research field and they should use qualitative methods in multi-faceted (external and internal) ways in foresight studies. Still the qualitative parts of many studies are quite monological and these studies can be quite problematic, even confusing. More critical methodological approaches should be taken into serious consideration. As a methodological approach, the principle of triangulation should be used more in the fields of participatory foresight studies and technology foresight. The key focus of this article in the use of qualitative and phenomenological approaches in the fields of FTA and foresight. The aim of this theoretically oriented discussion is to promote the professional use of qualitative methods in foresight and FTA studies. The strength of qualitative analyses is linked to deeper understanding of social change and social patterns and structures. Actually people create and constitute the markets, networks, and crowds where technologies are applied and used. Internal systemic understanding of social realities is an important part of foresight activities, especially in participatory foresight studies. Internal and external analyses can be seen as complementary approaches, like qualitative and quantitative approaches. The use of qualitative methods is a conventional part of the research process in participatory foresight projects. A typical problem may be that the use of methods is not planned carefully enough and people are unaware of the underlying key assumptions of applied methods. Experimenting with phenomenology is not a simple task in foresight research. Therefore, the views and informative platforms expressed and presented in this article may be useful for foresight practitioners. © 2016;"FTA tools and methods; Methodological development; Methodology; Participative foresight; Phenomenology; Qualitative research; Science; Triangulation";;Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-85009926797;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The sub-pillars for human factors for innovation of the Global Innovation Index (GII) (Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO, 2014) are used to develop a gap coverage matrix that is analysed using the Portman method (Chow et al., 2011), to enable the identification of an optimum portfolio of investments, taking into account the level of funding for each program and any interrelationships between them. The methodology could either be refined through a foresight exercise or provide inputs to a foresight study for innovation policy that would generate threshold values for the gaps and describe their relative importance. The latter could provide an explicit and quantitative guide to decision-makers in the implementation of the foresight results.

Research and innovation are increasingly expected to support such efforts, with limited resources. In this context of high expectations towards R&I, collaboration across borders, both in performing and in programming, is commonly seen as a way to get more results with the same or even less resources. Such collaboration across borders at a European or even global scale faces many challenges. The role of foresight as a supporting tool for transnational research programming has been analysed in a number of cases, but evaluation of its added value has to date largely been unexplored. Building on earlier work how to embed foresight in transnational research programming (TRP), this paper therefore aims to look at how the use of foresight in TRP can be evaluated, and what lessons can be drawn for its future use in support of TRP. Starting from the existing knowledge base on foresight evaluation, an evaluation framework for foresight in TRP is proposed, and tested against the foresight exercise that supported EU Russia S&T collaboration under the FP7 project ERA.Net RUS. The findings have implications for the role foresight can play in tackling societal challenges and increasing competitiveness at European and global level. © 2016 The Authors;"Coordination of innovation policy; Foresight evaluation; Transnational research programming";"Haegeman, K.; European Commission, Joint Research Centre, C/Inca Garcilaso 3, Spain; email: karel-herman.haegeman@ec.europa.eu";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In the RHT, decisions on releases from reservoirs are taken for a number of time steps ahead (the Forecasting Horizon – FH) through an optimization model, based on the present water availability in reservoirs and on some forecasts of future inflows over the FH. Only the decision concerning the first time step (the current month) is then implemented, as new information on reservoir levels and forecasts becomes available so that the process can start again with updated information. The paper investigates how the quality of forecasts and the length of the FH impact on the effectiveness of the decisions taken. The evaluation exercise is carried out in two different demand scenarios considering some deficit-related indices, such as TSSD, the Sum of Squared Standardized Deficits, over an Operation Horizon (OH) of forty years. The scenarios are designed to evaluate the role of different demand levels (corresponding to higher/lower stress) on system’s behaviour. Results show that in systems with over-year behaviour, effective forecasts (here simulated through the best possible: actually occurred inflows from the current month up to the end of water year) seem to add little value to system’s operation compared to the most naive forecast (average monthly values), especially in contexts characterized by high pressure on resources. Where there is less pressure on resources, good-quality forecasts are more effective to improve operation. A FH of 24 months seems to enhance significantly system’s performances compared to a FH of 12 months, while FHs longer than two years produce no improvements in system’s performances. The paper also tries to define the limits of a finite-horizon operation technique such as the RHT by benchmarking it with an idealistic release schedule obtained by a model that performs allocation with Perfect Foresight over the whole Operation Horizon. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;"Droughts; Rolling Horizon Technique; Water resources systems";"Arena, C.; Dipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, Ambientale, Aerospaziale e dei Materiali, Palermo UniversityItaly; email: claudio.arena@unipa.it";Springer Netherlands;9204741;;;;English;Water Resour.

Empirically, it aims to explore sectoral futures at European level in a range of different sectors (automotive, construction, textile, KIBS, wholesale & retail), to identify cross-cutting patterns of sectoral change, and to highlight implications that these may raise for European innovation policy. In order to do this in a systematic manner, it also has a conceptual and methodological ambition, namely to devise a sectoral innovation foresight methodology that builds explicitly on concepts derived from sectoral innovation systems approaches. This theory-led methodology allows exploring and interpreting future developments at sectoral level in a coherent and comparable manner. Technologies and knowledge, actors and organisations, user needs and demand, as well as institutional and policy frameworks are taken into account; elements that need to co-evolve for any innovation system scenario to unfold. This conceptual framework is translated into a sector innovation foresight methodology that was used to guide a multi-sector foresight initiative. Based on a meta-analysis of insights from five different sectors, cross-sectoral patterns of future change as well as cross-cutting policy issues are pointed out. Three areas of cross-cutting changes have been identified: a) the shift from products to systems and services, b) blurring boundaries between sectors, and c) sectoral and cross-sectoral integration of sustainability demands, and the governance of interactions between sectors. Foresight projects at sectoral level have been conducted rarely as compared to technology-centered or societal-issue centered foresights or retrospective sectoral innovation system studies. By relying explicitly on a theoretical framework of sectoral innovation systems, this paper explores the potential of better linking innovation theory to policy- and strategy-oriented foresight. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.";"Comparative analysis; Emerging technologies; Foresight; Key enabling technologies; Sectoral innovation systems";"Weber, K.M.; AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Innovation Systems DepartmentAustria; email: matthias.weber@ait.ac.at";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

These ecosystems extend across different layers including the organisational, sectoral, regional, national and international dimensions. The interconnectedness of these layers has not have received much attention in foresight literature and practise. However, both the development and diffusion of innovations are subject to framework conditions not only within, but also across, multiple layers of innovation ecosystems. The design and management of foresight exercises are thus liable to addressing and serving these different layers — especially when the goal is to improve the performance and impact of such “interconnected and interdependent systems”. This paper develops further the concept of ‘multi-layered foresight’ by addressing multiple layers of innovation ecosystems in foresight design and management. We explore the implications of applying this type of foresight on improving systemic understanding, enhancing stakeholder networking and developing innovation capacities across the layers of ecosystems. The theoretical underpinnings are tested through a case study of the ‘Personal Health Systems (PHS) Foresight’ project. This project explored international future developments in the health sector, which is characterised by multiple disciplines, communities of practise, technologies, and geographical contexts. In the case of PHS the emerging innovation ecosystems are often conditioned by fragmented development communities, major barriers to market development, and duplication of efforts. The project combined analytical, social networking, online envisioning and scenario building methods to address complexity and create impact in multiple layers. Possible futures for personal health systems were explored through intense dialogues with stakeholders and a desirable future state was sketched through the success scenario methodology. The implications and strategic issues for different groups of stakeholders were outlined, enabling these stakeholders to articulate their efforts as part of a broader agenda at the multiple layers of innovation ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Coordination; Governance; Innovation ecosystem; Multi-layered foresight; Personal health system";"Könnölä, T.; Insight Foresight InstituteSpain; email: totti.konnola@if-institute.org";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Foresight is an important part of creating smart specialization strategies. However, both the smart specialization concept and foresight have been criticized for lacking an empirical and theoretical foundation that can help guide their application in practice. This paper contributes to the theoretical foundation of smart specialization and regional foresight by drawing on the field of economic geography and elaborating a typology for patterns of smart specialization. We highlight that there are different paths to reaching smart specialization within the same industrial domain. The empirical research focuses on the offshore wind service sector in four regions around the North Sea. The findings corroborate a typology that offers four distinct patterns—diversification, transition, radical foundation, and modernization—all of which can enable the creation of new industrial activities where regions enter an emerging industry based on fundamentally different starting points. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight; Offshore wind servicing; Regional branching; Regional foresight; Renewable energy; Smart specialization dynamics; Smart specialization policy; Theory";"Tanner, A.N.; Centre for Innovation, Research and Competences in the Learning Economy (CIRCLE), Lund UniversitySweden; email: anne.tanner@circle.lu.se";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

We address key challenges faced by policymakers developing innovation strategies for emerging technologies. In particular, we explore ways that FTA might be structured to investigate the complex innovation system journeys of novel technologies as they are developed, diffused, and deployed. In doing this, we draw on concepts from technology and operations management and related literatures to more carefully characterise the: (1) ‘technical infrastrucutre’ required to develop emerging technologies; (2) key technology transitions involved in diffusion; and (3) complex industrial value networks into which they may eventually get deployed. We investigate the extent to which these categories are already used within national technology foresight exercises. In particular, we review over 240 international FTA-related policy, strategy, and analysis documents for ‘advanced materials’. We find that – although generally used inconsistently and unsystematically within FTA – these categories repeatedly emerge as important elements in many policies, strategies, and underpinning foresight exercises. We conclude by arguing that these categories should be carefully considered in initial FTA design. And that, by doing so, FTA exercises may better reveal potential ‘innovation system failures’ and help policymakers coordinate policy actions in response. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.";"Emerging Technologies; Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA); Industrial systems; Innovation systems; Lifecycle";"Featherston, C.R.; Centre for Science, Technology and Innovation Policy, Institute for Manufacturing, University of CambridgeUnited Kingdom; email: crf33@cam.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

This is especially the case for ICT-based ‘smart systems’, where an increasing number of different technologies and systems are interconnected to each other, involving a complex variety of actors. Roadmapping is a widely used tool to support such strategic policy processes, yet there remain significant challenges in terms of structuring and managing roadmapping exercises. This paper proposes a systematic process of managing roadmapping practices to develop effective strategies for standardisation in support of innovation. Based on literature regarding public-level strategy roadmaps and reviews of existing standardisation roadmapping exercises, a more systematic process has been developed, incorporating activities and tools to address increased challenges associated with standardisation in such complex areas. The findings of the research not only provide guidance on how roadmapping processes can be structured and organised to more effectively address standardisation issues in innovation strategies for smart systems, but also highlight policy implications, including potential roles for government in supporting standardisation efforts. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight; Roadmapping; Smart systems; Standardisation; Standards; Strategy";"Ho, J.-Y.; Centre for Science, Technology & Innovation Policy, Institute for Manufacturing, University of Cambridge, 17 Charles Babbage Road, United Kingdom; email: jyh25@cam.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

We initialize GCAM to reproduce observed agriculture and land use in 1990 and forecast agriculture and land use patterns on one-year time steps to 2010. We report overall model performance for nine crops in 14 regions. We report areas where the hindcast is in relatively good agreement with observations and areas where the correspondence is poorer. We find that when given observed crop yields as input data, producers in GCAM implicitly have perfect foresight for yields leading to over compensation for year-to-year yield variation. We explore a simple model in which planting decisions are based on expectations but production depends on actual yields and find that this addresses the implicit perfect foresight problem. Second, while existing policies are implicitly calibrated into IAMs, changes in those policies over the period of analysis can have a dramatic effect on the fidelity of model output. Third, we demonstrate that IAMs can employ techniques similar to those used by the climate modeling community to evaluate model skill. We find that hindcasting has the potential to yield substantial benefits to the IAM community. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.";"crop production; GCAM; Hindcast; integrated assessment model; land-use; model validation";;World Scientific Publishing Co.

While there are (numeric) indicators to map S&T developments such as patents, publications or standards, new indicators are required to map other areas of the innovation system. In this regard, one option is the examination of news reporting. News is a recognized channel for innovation diffusion and plays an important role in informing society. To contrast changes and developments in science and society, specifically the link between both is addressed in this article by comparing the content of news articles and scientific publications. Thus, the aim of this article is to first argue the benefit of integrating the media in the innovation system debate because of its recognized role in innovation diffusion and to develop a methodology to automatically compare scientific and media discourses. To process the volume of textual data according to a common analytical scheme, a text mining framework has been developed. The results offer valuable input for examining the present state of themes and technologies and, thereby, support future planning activities. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight; Future technology analysis; Innovation system; Media analysis; Publications analysis; Text mining";;Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

A novel combination of a qualitative method - Systematic Qualitative Foresight (SQF) - and quantitative simulation using discrete choice stated preference methods is applied. The main dataset is a travel behaviour survey of over 2000 residents of London and Glasgow. Three illustrative SQF-based scenarios are developed incorporating society, technology and climate dimensions. For each scenario, the choice of long-distance travel mode by two groups of respondents generated by cluster analysis is simulated using stated preference survey data to describe the choices likely to be made by actors within each scenario. We demonstrate the importance of considering a wide range of variables when creating instruments for infrastructure planning decisions. Our results show that weather-related disruption has consequences for travel behaviour, with a considerable number of travellers deciding not to travel despite the importance of their trip. However, the vast majority of travellers would still travel. This should be considered by policy makers, and those responsible for transport infrastructure, in order to increase its resilience to extreme weather and demand, and better devise contingency plans to contain, and minimise, the effect of the disruptions on the users. The method described has wider implications for infrastructure planning, particularly in its ability to engage a broader range of stakeholders and to avoid linear models of prediction. By emphasising the creation of a plausible decision space, it offers the possibility of increased robustness and resilience in infrastructure planning. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Climate; Discrete choice; Resilience; Scenarios; Technology; Transport";"Zanni, A.M.; Independent Researcher and Consultant, Brighton and HoveUnited Kingdom; email: amz@albertomzanni.com";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Thefindings suggest that the employment of intuition in dynamic settings is indeed common but, contraryto previous beliefs, it is much more nuanced. Not only do various professional groups utilize differentkinds of intuition, they also adjust its use to the specific type of activity. A distinction has been detectedin particular between approaches to task-related versus people-related activities. The understandingwhich organizational player and under which conditions relies on intuition, provides new insights intoknowledge generation in modern organizations. © 2017 by IGI Global.

Proteomics is a Big Data technology and a next generation biomarker, supporting novel system diagnostics and therapeutics in psychiatry. Proteomics technology is, in fact, much older than genomics and dates to the 1970s, well before the launch of the international Human Genome Project. While the genome has long been framed as the master or “elite” executive molecule in cell biology, the proteome by contrast is humble. Yet the proteome is critical for life—it ensures the daily functioning of cells and whole organisms. In short, proteins are the blue-collar workers of biology, the down-to-earth molecules that we cannot live without. Since 2010, proteomics has found renewed meaning and international attention with the launch of the Human Proteome Project and the growing interest in Big Data technologies such as proteomics. This article presents an interdisciplinary technology foresight analysis and conceptualizes the terms “environtome” and “social proteome”. We define “environtome” as the entire complement of elements external to the human host, from microbiome, ambient temperature and weather conditions to government innovation policies, stock market dynamics, human values, political power and social norms that collectively shape the human host spatially and temporally. The “social proteome” is the subset of the environtome that influences the transition of proteomics technology to innovative applications in society. The social proteome encompasses, for example, new reimbursement schemes and business innovation models for proteomics diagnostics that depart from the “once-a-life-time” genotypic tests and the anticipated hype attendant to context and time sensitive proteomics tests. Building on the “nesting principle” for governance of complex systems as discussed by Elinor Ostrom, we propose here a 3-tiered organizational architecture for Big Data science such as proteomics. The proposed nested governance structure is comprised of (a) scientists, (b) ethicists, and (c) scholars in the nascent field of “ethics-of-ethics”, and aims to cultivate a robust social proteome for personalized medicine. Ostrom often noted that such nested governance designs offer assurance that political power embedded in innovation processes is distributed evenly and is not concentrated disproportionately in a single overbearing stakeholder or person. We agree with this assessment and conclude by underscoring the synergistic value of social and biological proteomes to realize the full potentials of proteomics science for personalized medicine in psychiatry in the present era of Big Data. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.;"Big data; Futures studies; Innovation management systems; Precision medicine; Proteomics; Technology foresight";"Özdemir, V.; Department of Public Relations, Faculty of Communications, Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, and the Office of the President, International Technology and Innovation Policy, Gaziantep UniversityTurkey; email: vural.ozdemir@alumni.utoronto.ca";Springer-Verlag Wien;3009564;;JNTRF;26645377;English;J.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey of Canadian CI practitioners who are SCIP members (Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professional), using a revision to a previously used instrument designed to examine competitive intelligence practices. Findings: Canadian SCIP member competitive intelligence practices seem to be more formalized than those found in the global SCIP study in 2006 with 84.8 per cent having a manager with CI responsibilities, 61 per cent with a formal centralized CI unit and only 9 per cent responding that CI was done informally. Intelligence units were generally smaller with 38 per cent having one full-time CI resource and 41 per cent having between 2 and 4 full-time resources. Additional findings on information sources used, analytical techniques used, evaluation methods and communication methods are reported. Research limitations/implications: Despite getting responses from close to 50 per cent of SCIP members, the small sample size (79) makes it difficult to generalize the results beyond the Canadian SCIP environment and limits the testing that can be done. Originality/value: The last study on Canadian competitive intelligence practices was in 2008, thus part of the originality of the study was getting more recent information on corporate intelligence practice. In addition, this is the first Canadian study to focus specifically on known intelligence practitioners (SCIP members). Past studies focused on companies in general regardless of whether respondents knew what competitive intelligence was or practiced CI. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Competitive intelligence; Strategic management";"Calof, J.; University of OttawaCanada; email: Calof@telfer.uottawa.ca";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85034594226;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the author’s 25 years of experience designing, running, and studying Canadian Government CI programs, a classification scheme to classify these programs has been developed and used. Also, by using program review information, this paper looks at evidence for program impact on regional and sectoral economic development. Findings: This paper identifies a broad range of federal and provincially sponsored CI programs aimed at helping both government officers and those outside the department make better decisions. The review identified several roles that the government can play in using CI: creator of CI (both for their own purposes and also for helping Canadian companies), CI environment skills builder (helping Canadian companies develop skills in developing their own CI) and CI partner (working jointly with Canadian companies in developing CI). While there have not been many formal program reviews of the CI programs sponsored by Canadian Government departments and agencies, anecdotal evidence (from training program participant evaluations) and a comprehensive review of a small community CI-based economic development program support positive sectoral and regional economic development results arising from these programs. Practical implications: CI programs can be used as part of a government’s regional and sectoral economic development approach. CI can be used to assist with decision-making both within and outside the government. This paper identifies several different kinds of programs that can be used to further a government’s economic development agenda. Originality/value: There are very few articles that examine how governments have helped companies to develop CI and how they have used CI, and none has looked at the impact of these on regional and sectoral economic development. This paper, based on the author’s experiences, provides a view of the Canadian programs and their impact on regional/sectoral economic development. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Competitive intelligence; Economic development; Economic intelligence; Foresight; Government intelligence; Program review";"Calof, J.; Telfer School of Management, University of OttawaCanada; email: Calof@telfer.uottawa.ca";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85014858291;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It firstly investigates the complexity of the relationship to the value generated by these economies by highlighting the double movement of demonetization and remonetization of the value identified in the different aspects of these economies. It then problematizes a second issue in the diversity of forms of relationship to values in the different forms of economic exchange systems that characterize these economies. At the reflective and methodological level, the approach developed in the article makes it possible to grasp the need to evolve, as far as these economies are concerned, toward hybrid and systemic methods able to meet the emerging social demand for statistical institutes. It identifies the need to jointly develop with economic and political actors a common system of reference embedded in a regulatory framework. © De Boeck Supérieur.;"Circular economy; Collaborative economy; Decommodification; Methodological innovations; Value production";;Boeck Universite;342971;;RPVIA;;French;Reflets.

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, best international practice was analyzed that provided a solid basis for Russian S&T Foresight 2030 (section “Nanotechnology and new materials”). The study used a wide range of advanced Foresight methods adapted to Russian circumstances. During the Foresight study, the authors integrated “market pull” and research “technology push” approaches including both traditional methods (priority-setting, roadmaps, global challenges analysis) and relatively new approaches (horizon scanning, weak signals, wild cards, etc.). Findings: Using the methods of the Foresight, the authors identified trends with the greatest impact on the sphere of nanotechnology and new materials, promising markets, product groups and potential areas of demand for Russian innovation technologies and developments in this field. The authors assessed the state-of-the-art of the domestic research in the area of nanotechnologies and new materials to identify “white spots”, as well as parity zone and leadership, which can be the basis for integration into international alliances and positioning of Russia as a center of global technological development in this field. Originality/value: The results of applying Foresight methodology toward revelation of the most prospective S&T areas in the field of nanotechnologies and new materials can be used by a variety of stakeholders including federal and regional authorities, technology platforms and innovation and industrial clusters, leading universities and scientific organizations in formulation of their research and strategic agenda. Russian businesses including both large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises can use results of the study in creating their strategic R&D programs and finding appropriate partners. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Advanced materials; Convergence; Foresight; Nanotechnologies; NBIC technologies; New materials";"Vishnevskiy, K.; National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: kvishnevsky@hse.ru";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85018743570;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Back in 1985, before the popularity of personal computers as business machines, the idea of a paperless office was just a glimmer on the distant horizon. At a fledgling company in America, an ambitious young executive with a hunch decided that paper should be handled electronically, but he did not have ten million dollars to spend on R&D. He had guessed correctly that in a world of mainframes, where microcomputers were still being viewed as novelties, this view would change in the near future and impact global commerce. Armed with the knowledge that being first to market often translates into competitive advantage, he hired a small team of software engineers on a shoe string budget. Six months later, the paperless office system went online in Chicago, Detroit, and Los Angeles. Within a year, it was implemented in all the company’s regional offices scattered throughout the USA. Today, the firm is a multinational corporation enjoying a formidable market share. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.;;;Taylor and Francis;;"9781315471129; 9781138203686";;;English;Global Bus.

In the light of technology and innovation policy, many individual Foresight studies are undertaken which are separate and little linked with the broader policy scope and ambition. This paper aims to look at an approach towards a consistent Foresight system which is linked closely to science, technology and innovation policy. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides an in-depth case study of the Russian Foresight system. The case study is based on desk research and extensive experience of the authors with the system. Findings: Russia has developed a systematic approach towards organising Foresight which involves and serves multiple stakeholders, including government, ministries, federal and regional agencies, higher education institutions, public research institutes, state-owned companies and private businesses and a large range of associations. Under the auspicious of a dedicated commission, targeted Foresight is undertaken with clearly defined scope for each. The paper finds that the Russian system is unique in its organisational structure and in the integration of Foresight with science, technology and innovation policy measures. Originality/value: The paper describes all facets of the Russian Foresight system which has not been done before. It also outlines the practical steps to further develop and leverage the system. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Foresight; Foresight implementation; Foresight network; National foresight; Science; STI priority setting; technology and innovation policy";"Meissner, D.; Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge, National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: dirk.meissner@gmail.com";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85029827116;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the author performs an ex post evaluation of the Foresight study. The methods used are the literature review of the research and analytical publications that appeared after 2014, policy analysis of new national energy regulations and technologies, interviews and expert panels, and performing a final SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis of the Foresight study. Findings: As a result of the study, the expediency, efficacy, process efficiency, quality, impact and process improvement of the National S&T Foresight 2030 were assessed. Moreover, the SWOT for the National Foresight and its energy-related outcomes were identified. The National Foresight methodology and its outcomes are critically reviewed, and recommendations for their refinement are made. Research limitations/implications: Future research on the topic may include subsequent ex ante and ex post evaluations of energy technology foresights that will include revised lists of technologies, given the rapidly changing energy markets, as well as an assessment of the integration of the study results in the energy and S&T policy documents. Practical implications: The practical implications of the study are linked with turning the prospective R&D areas identified through the Foresight into state priorities for funding energy research. Energy companies may utilize the study results in their development plans and R&D strategies. Originality/value: This paper offers a valuable insight in the future of energy research and technologies in Russia. It is a comprehensive study that covers all energy aspects from extraction of hydrocarbons to fuel cells and nuclear energy. An ex post assessment of the study is made with implications for the future research. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Energy research; Energy technologies; Ex post evaluation; Foresight; Russia";"Proskuryakova, L.; Science and Technology Studies Lab, National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: lproskuryakova@hse.ru";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85018748907;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At times, they intentionally ignore the changes taking place around them. At other times, their situational dynamics (e.g. location, industry, business focus) obscure their view to see what is transpiring. New knowledge stays buried in the academic journals, inaccessible and hidden from businesspeople. Then suddenly, from the left field, they are hit by a dramatic change and find themselves unprepared; and in the aftermath, ask questions such as why did Blockbuster not see Netflix coming? or why did Borders fail to become Amazon? To develop strategic foresight, it is important for business leaders to sometimes take a moment away from what seems real and pragmatic and explore the new developments. This article will walk businesspeople through the interdisciplinary scientific developments taking place in one manifestation of the amazing world of artificial intelligence: inventing consciousness. For businesspeople, (borrowing the term from Pink-Floyd’s album) this Momentary Lapse of Reason can provide a break from the comfortable and monotonous known. Moreover, businesspeople may discover that these developments are temporally closer than they had anticipated and their strategic plans need to incorporate such innovative scenarios. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.";;"Naqvi, A.; Millikin UniversityUnited States";Taylor and Francis;;"9781315471129; 9781138203686";;;English;Global Bus.

Utilizing a helpful, four-part structure, the authors indicate how corporate foresight is fundamental to interpret and lead change, focusing on the two cornerstones of organization and management. They advocate the separation of Research (oriented to the market of tomorrow) from Development (oriented to the market of today), the establishment of a Foresight unit and the concentration of research activities mainly on the acquisition and recombination of external know-how. After an overview of state-of-the-art literature on forecasting methods, they further propose the implementation of a “future coverage” methodology, which will enable companies to measure and verify the consistency between trends, strategic vision and offered products. These organizational and managing tools are then tested in a case study: the Italian company Eurotech SpA, a leader in the ICT sector. A useful resource for both managers and researchers, the book will help readers gain the tools necessary to tackle change and navigate complexity in organizations. © 2017 Alberto F.

Energy harvesting can ensure wireless and lossless energy supply to energy dependent technological solutions with independence of infrastructure. Electrical energy created through piezoelectricity occurs as soon as electrically balanced crystals are deformed through mechanical pressure. The purpose of this paper is to examine key academic interest in the field and presents a foresight of this interest into the future. Data from 2005 until today show an exponential growth of published scientific articles. In contrast to this, is found a low level of ability to convert the technology from academia to commercialization. A decision making model is proposed including a requirement for better understanding of niches, niche definitions and configuration of energy harvesting design considerations. © 2017 The Authors.

Currently, patent activity indicators are often used for technology foresight and for competitive intelligence as well. Nevertheless, causal relationship between these indicators, on the one hand, and strategic and tactical decisions in the sphere of technological development on meso- and microeconomic level, on the other hand, are not adequately investigated to solve practical tasks. The goal of the work is to systemize the challenges of technology trends analysis, which could be effectively solved on the base of patent landscape analysis. The article analyses the patent landscaping methodology and tools, as well as their use for evaluating the current competitive environment and technology foresight. The authors formulated the generalized classification for the criteria of promising technologies for a selected region. To assess the compliance of a technology with these criteria, we propose a system of corresponding indicators of patenting activity. Using the proposed methodology, we have analysed the patent landscape to select promising technologies for the Sverdlovsk region. The research confirmed the hypothesis of the patent landscapes performance in evaluating such technology indicators as stages of the life cycle stage, universality (applicability in different industries), pace of worldwide development, innovations and science availability in the region and potential possibilities for scientific collaboration with international research institutions and universities. The results of the research may be useful to the wide audience, including representatives small and medium enterprises, large companies and regional authorities for the tasks concerned with the technology trends analysis and technology strategy design.;"Decision-making; Development strategy; Lifecycle; Patent analysis; Patent family; Patent indicator; Patent landscape; Scientific collaboration; Technological development; Technological trend; Technology";"Kortov, S.V.; Ural Federal University, 19, Mira St., Russian Federation; email: s.v.kortov@urfu.ru";Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences;20726414;;;;Russian;Econ.

It was organised as a complex project involving dozens of organizations performing particular tasks under the overall coordination by the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and more than 2,000 experts in various S&T fields. Design/methodology/approach: Its methodology embraced a set of qualitative and quantitative methods and combined technology push and market pool approaches. For seven S&T areas (information and communication technologies, biotechnologies, medicine and health, new materials and nanotechnologies, rational use of nature, transportation and space systems, energy efficiency and energy saving), the following types of results have been obtained: global trends, national challenges and windows of opportunities; new markets and niches; innovation products and services; prospective technologies and R&D fields (50 thematic groups, over 1,000 items for all areas); assessment of the country’s positions vis-à-vis global leaders; recommendations for S&T and innovation policies. Findings: The paper covers prospective drivers of economic growth and relevant implications for anticipatory evidence-based policy; discussions of national challenges and building a common vision of the future among key stakeholders; the role of Foresight in particular as a communication platform that helps integrating stakeholder interests; strengthening existing and developing new capacities to increase national competitiveness; and to move up along existing and emerging global value chains. Originality/value: The Russian S&T Foresight, being deeply integrated in the national policy, can be considered as an exemplar tool for “wiring up” the national innovation system (NIS) of an emerging economy with its specific features and problems facing large-scale challenges. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Foresight; Grand challenges; Russia; Science and technology";"Sokolov, A.; Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge, National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: sokolov@hse.ru";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85029888439;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes Houston Framework Foresight Method. Findings: The percentage of students that are traditional college-age, those most interested in living on campus, is becoming smaller. Increasingly, the markets of growth for colleges and universities is found by engaging students at a distance. Additionally, even students that live within commuting distance to campus often attend classes by virtual means and improved delivery technologies will only make this option more attractive. Many on-campus housing strategic plans contain buildings that meet the needs of the students of today not the students of tomorrow. By assessing the impact of the key trends, administrators can make better choices for their campus. Research limitations/implications: Recommendations are based on a combination of the best available research and analysis and is not intended to act as a predictor of the future. This paper presents only one of many possible futures that were developed based on recognized forecasting methods.

A number of recent developments like drops in oil prices, increasing global conflicts, mass immigration and economic stagnation have had disruptive effects on long-term policies and strategies. The purpose of this paper is to provide a dynamic and adaptive Foresight approach as required by the fast-changing global landscape. Design/methodology/approach: The scenario approach presented in the paper aims to develop multiple time horizons by bringing together short-term forecasts and long-term exploratory and visionary scenarios. Each time horizon allows for re-considering and dynamically changing drivers and assumptions of scenarios and thus builds not a single linear, but multiple and dynamic pathways into the future. Following the presentation on the background and description of the methodology, the paper illustrates the proposed approach with a case study on science and technology (S&T) development in Russia. Findings: The flexible scenario approach allows developing and strategies with similar adaptability and flexibility. Practical implications: The scenario approach presented in the paper may be applicable for Foresight exercises at all levels of governance, including national, international, regional and corporate.

Design/methodology/approach: Literature overview discusses how glocalization, changing funding structures and digitalization affect campus management. Empirical part explores how these forces affect management processes through 36 interviews on multiple embedded cases in the main campuses of Aalto University in Finland and the University of Melbourne in Australia. Findings: Major challenges include future foresight, institutional sharing, economical paucity and functional flexibility. Heterogeneous user behaviors challenge absolute spatial measures as bases for designing learning and working environments. Finding a balance between long-haul portfolio maintenance for the university and future users and short-haul flexible pilots for the current user communities is crucial. Research limitations/implications: The results derive from interviews of 36 campus management professionals from two campus management organizations limiting the validity and the reliability of the study. Further studies should be conducted by replicating the study in another context, by interviewing end users and clients and by investigating case investments and impacts over time. Practical implications: Campus managers can answer the challenges through practical applications such as big data collection and sharing in physical environments, integrated service provision to thematic communities, cross-pollination of user communities and open access to information and infrastructure services. Originality/value: This paper provides insights and tools to strategic alignment by comparing campus management of two fundamentally different systems in the context of higher education and on-going digitalization. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Campus management processes; Corporate real estate management; Finland and Australia; Higher education; Learning organizations; Strategic alignment";"Rytkönen, E.; Department of Civil and Environmental Technology, Aalto UniversityFinland; email: eelis.rytkonen@aalto.fi";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;1463001X;;;;English;Journal of Corporate Real Estate;2-s2.0-85019065007;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

All sections are logically combined with each other and are scheduled in a global way where the integration between geology and engineering is taken as the guide, reservoir stimulation as the focus, maximizing production as the target, and factory-like operation as the measure. The fundamental geological and engineering factors that affect the productivity is analyzed, and the adaptivities of well completion and fracturing techniques are systematically assessed with in-depth investigations into the reservoir physical properties, geomechanics, fracture features, well layout and drilling, reservoir stimulation, and liquid discharge for production, et al. Assisted by effective organization, management, and operation practice, rapid accumulation and enrichment of operation experiences and multi-disciplined knowledge covering well drilling and cementation, fracturing, and production and its test production are achieved. Economic development is fulfilled in tight reservoirs by hierarchically and dynamically optimizing engineering efficiency and development profit that arise from continually adjusting and perfecting technical projects related to well drilling, fracturing, and so on. © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.;;;Society of Petroleum Engineers;;;;;English;Soc.

The analysis leads to a discussion on the present state of the Russian agroindustry and possible future strategies for adaptation in the context of the rapidly changing global environment. Design/methodology/approach: The design of this study is based on the application of the core methods of Foresight. First, a trend analysis is undertaken using reviews and expert methods. Trends identified are mapped using a social, technological, economic, environmental, political and value (STEEPV) framework to ensure that a broad range of trends are covered, which may be stemming from various factors affecting the agriculture sector. The analysis of the big picture of global trends and challenges, interacting with country-specific structural factors, translates are translated into the opportunities and threats, which will in turn help to develop possible strategies for adaptation. Findings: This study develops two adaptive strategies for the development of the Russian agroindustry that are feasible in different short- and long–term time horizons. The first strategy is considered to be the most likely choice for the period before 2020. It includes radical imports’ substitution (of commodities as well as machinery and high-tech components) for ensuring national food security with inevitable temporary setbacks in efficiency and labour productivity. The second strategy, which becomes feasible after 2020, considers re-integrating Russia into global supply chains and expanding commodities exports (volumes and nomenclature) based on full-scale technological modernization with the use of international capital. Research limitations/implications: The study design is based on the assumption that Russia’s position as a country, which is highly self-sufficient on basic agricultural products and large exporter of crop commodities and fertilizers, will remain unchanged in the horizon of at least 20 years. However, long-term forecasts should also scrutinize the possibility of radical structural changes. Therefore, future research should concentrate on wild cards that can completely disrupt and transform the Russian agriculture industry and as well as the whole economy. Practical implications: This paper suggests a number of recommendations on national science and technology policy for the three main industries of the Russian agricultural sector: crop husbandry, animal breeding and food processing (the fisheries sector is excluded from the scope of this paper). In addition, this paper proposes a number of measures towards alleviating the institutional barriers to raise the investment attractiveness of the sector. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in the originality of the research topic and methodology. The Russian agricultural sector has rarely been studied in the context of global agricultural challenges and threats taken on the highest level of aggregation beyond commodity market analysis or agro-climatic and logistics factors. There are few or no studies that lay out a map of possible long-term strategies of Russian agroindustry adaptive development. The Foresight methodology applied in this study is customized to better fit the practical purposes of the study. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Agriculture; Biotechnology; Food; Foresight; Russia; Trends";"Saritas, O.; Higher School of Economics, National Research UniversityRussian Federation; email: osaritas@hse.ru";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85018781416;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Owing to a number of potential application areas of nanotechnologies within this sector, the purpose of this study is to take defense as a case and propose a strategic roadmap for the use of nanotechnologies in the Turkish Defense Industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study presented in this paper uses a bibliometric analysis of the most cited publications in the past decade with the aim of identifying the trends in the development of nanotechnology. Interviews were carried out with experts based on the featured words of bibliometric analysis (nanoparticles, nanostructure, self-assembly, drug delivery, graphene, etc.) to reveal the commercialization time of nanotechnology products and applications. After that, a survey was carried out with engineers for determining the possible emergence time of nanotechnology applications and/or products used in military up to year 2035. Finally, a roadmap was created based on the obtained data from bibliometric analysis, interviews and survey results. Findings: Nanotechnology roadmap was prepared, one which would contribute to the preparation of the defense industry for the future and help in keeping up with technological developments. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Interviews and surveys have limitation with the bounded rationality of corresponders. Practical implications: The paper proposed a nanotechnology roadmap for the defense sector with a data-led foresight practice. Originality/value: Performing such a study is considered to be crucial for the armies of developed and developing countries, so that the military sector also avails benefits from this revolutionary technology. Quantitative and qualitative methods were mixed for developing the roadmap. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Bibliometric analysis; Defense; Defense industry; Military; Nanotechnology; Roadmapping";"Aydogdu, A.; Turkish Armed Forces FoundationTurkey; email: aydogdu@gmail.com";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85026902641;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach: Having reviewed existing global energy forecasts made by reputable multilateral and national government agencies, major energy corporations and specialised consulting firms, the authors noticed that most of them are by and large based on the extrapolation of conventional long-term trends depicting gradual growth of fossil fuels’ demand and catching-up supply. Unlike this approach, the paper focuses on the possible cases when conventional trends are broken, supply–demand imbalances become huge and the situation in the global energy markets is rapidly and dramatically changing with severe consequences for the Russian economy, seriously dependent on fossil fuels exports. Revealing these stress scenarios and major drivers leading to their realisation are in the focus of the research. Based on the Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Values (analytical framework) (STEEPV) approach, the authors start from analysing various combinations of factors capable to launch stress scenarios for the Russian economy. Formulating concrete stress scenarios and assessing their negative impact on the Russian economy constitute the next step of the analysis. In conclusion, the paper underlines the urgency to integrate stress analysis related to global energy trends into the Russian national systems of technology foresight and strategic planning, which are now in the early stages of development. Findings: The analysis of global energy market trends and various combinations of related economic, political, technological and ecological factors allowed to formulate four stress scenarios particularly painful for the Russian economy. They include the currently developing scenario “Collapse of oil prices”, and three potential ones: “Gas abundance”, “Radical de-carbonisation” and “Hydrogen economy”. One of the most important conclusions of the paper is that technology-related drivers are playing the leading role in stress scenario realisation, but it is usually a specific combination of other drivers (interlacing with technology-related factors) that could trigger the launch a particular scenario. Research limitations/implications: This study’s approach is based on the assumption that Russia’s dependence on hydrocarbons exports as one of the main structural characteristics of the Russian economy will remain intact. However, for the long-term perspective, this assumption might not hold true. So, new research will be needed to review the stress scenarios within the context of radical diversification of the Russian economy. Practical implications: This paper suggests a number of practical steps aimed at introducing stress analysis as one of the key functions within the energy-related sectoral components of the Russian national systems of technology forecasting and strategic planning. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper is determined both by the subject of the analysis and approach taken to reveal it. In contrast to most of research in this area, the main focus has been moved from the opportunities and potential benefits of contemporary technology-related global energy shifts to their possible negative impact on the national economy. Another important original feature of the approach is that existing global energy forecasts are used only as a background for core analysis centred around the cases when conventional energy trends are broken. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Energy; Energy market forecasting; Global energy trends; Scenario; Stress scenarios; Technological shifts";"Bereznoy, A.; Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge, National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: abereznoy@hse.ru";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-85018777290;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our case concerns the food system. The inherent properties of complex adaptive systems make the exact trajectories of these systems unforeseeable. However, since the systems unfold into a common direction, we can say something about the qualities of the milestones toward which these systems navigate. Attractors configure the evolution of complex adaptive systems. Since attractors are the most stable and robust elements in these systems, they are more feasible targets for foresight than the several variants that they configure and effectuate. We have depicted attractors of sustainable local food systems by futures images: through working with an appropriate level of abstraction, by leaning on a multi-perspective approach and by breaking the linear relationship between the present and the future. In this context they were sustainability-oriented trading and delivery systems, food cultures, product development projects, food brands and transparent food systems. We also located hot spots of structural change and agency within the food system. These insights may inform transition management efforts, but they must be updated frequently, since sustainable development is a journey. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Complex adaptive systems; Food systems; Futures images; Sustainability transitions";;Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The researchers were entrusted with the task of identifying the specifics of modern teenagers vision of the future; predicting of most promising media professions-from the point of view of young people; evaluating the possibilities of the emergence of new types of media and attitude towards the impending digital future. Session moderators used a variety of research methods, such as emotional deep problems study, survey of all participants with both open-end and close-end questions, elements of pedagogically organized team play offering different levels of generalization, joint analysis of the results, and divergent presentations of outcomes. The survey findings were confirmed in the course of the team game, where the schoolchildren acted as experts and provided the prognostic description of 2035 media reality. During visualization of the ideas at a higher abstraction level the obtained images were identical to those that occurred during the game.From the results of Media Environment in 2035 Foresight Session, the moderators concluded that modern teenagers feel neither threatened, nor scared of the impending future and that is significantly different from media behavior of adults. © 2016 Zhilavskaya et al.";"Environment; Forecasts; Foresight; Future; Generation Z; Media reality";"Zhilavskaya, I.; Moscow State University of EducationRussian Federation; email: zhiv3@yandex.ru";IJESE;13063065;;;;English;Int.

Box 10332, Nakasero, Kampala, Uganda; Mawejje, J., Economic Policy Research Centre, Makerere University Campus, 51 Pool Road, P.O. Box 7841, Kampala, Uganda";;;Background: Availability of reliable energy supply plays a critical role in the social, economic, and cultural transformation of society. The Uganda electricity sector has suffered long standing supply side constraints that resulted in suppressed demand and outages. Recent developments, including the completion of the 250 MW Bujagali project in 2012, have resulted in sustained growth in peak demand. However, this growth in peak demand appeared to stagnate by 2013. This study examines the recent trends as well as forecast the medium term path of electricity peak demand in Uganda. Methods: This study uses descriptive data exploration analysis and polynomial functions augmented by empirical estimations of structural break equations to account for the observed trends in electricity peak demand. The study applies the double exponential forecasting model to forecast total peak electricity demand. Results: The results show that the recent surge in electricity peak demand is due to increased electricity exports. Moreover, the results show a shift in electricity demand from peak to nonpeak time-of-use, possibly due to changing consumption patterns in the industrial sectors. Conclusions: The study draws two major conclusions. First, the growth in Uganda’s electricity demand in general and peak demand in particular has not stagnated as such but rather partially shifted from peak to nonpeak time-of-use zone. Second, electricity exports have contributed to growth of electricity peak demand. Importantly, higher electricity exports need to be considered in line with the system capacity given the current electricity spinning reserves of Uganda are less than 15 % of Uganda current installed capacity. © 2016, The Author(s).;;"Mawejje, J.; Economic Policy Research Centre, Makerere University Campus, 51 Pool Road, P.O.

First, Twitter is discussed as a data source for retrieving input to roadmapping or scenarios. Therefore, an analysis framework is introduced and illustrated for the case of #quantifiedself. Second, options are outlined how to interact with a global network of people using Twitter as communication platform, e.g., for being used during foresight workshops or receiving input for scenario development. As the results show, both, the monitoring of topics and technologies, but also the active user engagement, are supported.

A comparison of these forecasts with reality for recent years is given. The lack of a series of important events and tendencies in the world development is found in this report. Sometimes authors consider that fact as a forecast error in other cases as an attempt to place the USA and the consequences of their activity in a good light. Methodology of long-term forecasting of NIC is close to foresight. First of all the authors are interested in estimation of new role of the USA in changing World. They have constructed two global indexes of state power: one to estimate relative diplomatic power, the other to estimate relative material power. Forecasts were obtained with imitation computer model ""International Futures"" which included 6 relative dynamic sub-models with more than 2000 indicators on 70 states and regions of the world. It allowed consider different scenarios of development. Special part of the report was devoted to revolutionary technologies and economic growth. Many conclusions on demographic, urbanization trends, economic growth, shortage of water etc. are realistic. Weights of Russia, China, Japan in world economy are diminishing. China will leave behind the USA economically until 2030. Crisis of Eurozone and its disintegration are discussed in the report. Really, the consequences of ""Color revolutions"" and ""Arabian spring"" in which the USA undoubtedly took part are not estimated properly. The role of the USA in many cases as a factor of peace and development is overestimated. Thesis about ""damping of Islamic terrorism"" is not true. Problem of Ukraine isn't even mentioned. Crisis of Eurozone with millions refugees is underestimated. Non-controllable Islamic migration into Europe was not predicted. Disintegration of 15 countries is pointed out as possible. However, this list doesn't contain the Great Britain, Canada and other countries. As it is known, 29 American states want to leave the USA peacefully. Anti-Russian sanctions and Russian counter-sanctions, new groups BRICS, TIKKS are not taken into account. Consequences of shale revolution were mistaken. New integration and disintegration processes are going. Divergence of forecasts and reality is inevitable. In some cases it is due to quick changes of the world and in others due to subjective point of view of the forecaster.";"Foresight method; Global problems; Long-term forecasting; World economy";;Primakov National Research Institute;1312227;;;;Russian;World Economy Int.

An online survey of 950 Australian citizens was conducted to identify five distinct views of the future. These myths of the future are ‘social crisis’, ‘eco-crisis’, ‘techno-optimism’, ‘power and economic inequality’, and ‘social transformation’. We discuss how these myths relate to the scenario archetypes as commonly employed in foresight literature. This analysis reveals how psychological and cognitive considerations may contribute to the literature and could be incorporated in the running of foresight exercises. Among the 5 myths, techno-optimism describes beliefs that science and technology are likely to create innovations that can improve our quality of life. It provides a firm anchor between scenario archetypes, myths of the future, and the STEEP (social, technological, economic, environmental, and political) framework, by holding a similar meaning in all three settings. Our analysis also elucidates how attitudes towards technological development are not value-free and are influenced by beliefs regarding how society and the environment should be managed, and to what extent technology itself can be a positive or negative force in this management. © 2016;"Attitudes to technological development; Cognitive science; Forecasting; Future archetypes; Futures studies";"Boschetti, F.; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial OrganisationAustralia; email: Fabio.Boschetti@csiro.au";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Today globalization radically transformed the range of economic activities that developing countries can perform. Production is fragmented and organized along global value chains. Dense flows of knowledge and technology are available, but need to be fully employed in the framework of coherent industrial strategies. This paper examines how and to which extent TF programs are needed in developing countries given the new prevailing global context. It argues that the TF and industrial strategy are and must be mutually consistent and they need to be taken seriously, coherently designed and implemented in light of their role to shape and economic growth. We provide preliminary support to this argument by discussing the theoretical foundations and justification of TF and industrial strategy, and then reviewing some relevant examples from Brazil, Chile and South Korea. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.;"Catch up; Global value chains; Industrial policy; Innovation policy; Technological change; Technology foresight";"Puppato, F.; Friedrich Schiller University and the Max Planck Institute of Economics, 8k Bachstraße, Germany; email: fernanda.puppato@gmail.com";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Among the key premises for developing a methodology are: (1) the increasing number of data sources addressing different phases of the STI development, and thus requiring a more holistic and integrated analysis; (2) the need for more customized clustering approaches particularly for the purpose of identifying trends; and (3) augmenting the policy impact of trends through gathering future-oriented intelligence on emerging developments and potential disruptive changes. Thus, the TTM methodology developed combines and jointly analyzes different datasets to gain intelligence to cover different phases of the technological evolution starting from the ‘emergence’ of a technology towards ‘supporting’ and ‘solution’ applications and more ‘practical’ business and market-oriented uses. Furthermore, the study presents a new algorithm for data clustering in order to overcome the weaknesses of readily available clusterization tools for the purpose of identifying technology trends. The present study places the TTM activities into a wider policy context to make use of the outcomes for the purpose of Science, Technology and Innovation policy formulation, and R&D strategy making processes.

Methods: The comparative analysis of the expert-analytical support of strategic management, socio-economic planning and economic design in the Russian Federation and a number of foreign countries, carried out in this article, let us conclude that the system of expert-analytical support in general meets the level of the leading developed countries. Findings: One of the main scientific tasks in this area is to improve the mechanisms and algorithms of the current support of strategic management in the Russian Federation, as well as to minimize and overcome the negative trends in the economy. The article considers the principles and selection algorithm for research and expert-analytical support that should be used in the further development of national foresight projects. The authors have formulated recommendations for improving the overall efficiency of the system of strategic management, socio-economic planning and economic design which allow creating conditions for a more active involvement of System Expert Societies (SES) to solving strategic problems of the economy. The main differences of the proposed algorithm from the current practice are as follows: A competitive and transparent nature; the possibility to form analytical teams on the principle of efficiency; ensuring the required level of quality of the final outcomes before the competition (since the required level of quality is determined by the SES status of participants that all contestants have). Application/Improvements: It is necessary to create a national system of expertanalytical communities, whose planning and forecasting results should be accounted for in the strategic management system, socio-economic planning and economic design at the national and regional levels.";"Budget planning; Economic potential; Macroeconomic forecast; Socio-economic planning; Strategic management of the economy";"Akhmadeev, R.G.; Plekhanov Russian University of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: ahm_rav@mail.ru";Indian Society for Education and Environment;9746846;;;;English;Indian J.

Until recently, roadmapping was used mainly for strategic planning, either from a technological or a market research perspective. Roadmaps emphasized either technological development or satisfaction of market demands but rarely both. Consequently, roadmaps either excessively stress the technology side, which might lead to technically sophisticated solutions that lack applicability, or overstress customer needs, neglecting business competence-building. Therefore, this paper develops a new integrated roadmapping approach that combines these two perspectives: it focuses on strategic planning by firms and public authorities for the long run goals of social and economic development, bringing together the market “pull” and technology “push” approach. This dual technique provides the potential for alternative means of choosing the most effective resource allocation. Integrated roadmaps include the various development stages of prospective innovations, e.g. stages of the existing innovation value chain, including R&D, manufacturing, market entry, services, and market expansion as well as prospective stages, including new technologies, products and services. The value of integrated roadmapping lies in its responsiveness to the challenges in innovation planning schemes for firms and sectors; it takes into consideration both future market requirements and the future resource basis for satisfying market needs, an approach not currently offered by traditional techniques. The paper develops a roadmapping methodology that can be used for planning firms' and public authorities' long-term innovation strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.";"Foresight; Innovation strategies; Integrated roadmap; Market pull; Market route; Roadmapping; Scenario; Technology push";"Vishnevskiy, K.; National Research University Higher School of EconomicsRussian Federation; email: kvishnevsky@hse.ru";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Under the term “Smart City,” numerous technology-based initiatives are emerging to help cities face contemporary challenges while the concept itself is evolving towards a more holistic approach. Nevertheless, the capability of smart initiatives to provide an integrated vision of our cities is still very limited. Eventually, many of these initiatives do not fulfill satisfactorily their initial objectives because they fail to understand the complexity, diversity, and uncertainty that characterize contemporary cities. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to display an urban functional system, capable of interpreting the city in a more holistic way, and to incorporate foresight tools so as to formulate Smart City visions in a more participatory way with the involvement of local stakeholders. © 2016 The Society of Urban Technology.;"foresight tools; smart city; systemic approach; urban complexity; urban visions";"Fernández-Güell, J.-M.; School of Architecture, Universidad Politécnica de MadridSpain; email: josemiguel.fernandez@upm.es";Routledge;10630732;;;;English;J.

Modern 'national security states' describe the world as dangerously uncertain, yet fall prey to a misplaced confidence in their ability to anticipate and prevent threats. I argue that classical realism, especially that of Clausewitz and Morgenthau, is a valuable resource for handling uncertainty more reflexively. Classical realism counsels that governments should go beyond attempts to improve foresight. They should try to check against the fallibility of their assumptions, marshal their power more conservatively, insure against the likelihood of predictive failure by developing the intellectual capability to react to the unknown, and avoid misplaced confidence in their ability to bring order into chaos. © 2016 British International Studies Association.;"Carl von Clausewitz; Classical Realism; Hans Morgenthau; National Security; Uncertainty";"Porter, P.; Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter, Streatham Drive, United Kingdom; email: p.porter@exeter.ac.uk";Cambridge University Press;20575637;;;;English;Europ.

Tourism destinations and hotels have suffered paradigmatic shifts from Fordist to post-Fordist and then to neo-Fordist modes of production and consumption. The current century is bringing us new neo-Fordist forms of hotel businesses, and due to the industry’s steady growth, more and more companies are required to develop new perspectives in order to stay relevant and to gain competitive advantage in the various fragmented markets. In an era of impermanency and fluidity, destinations and their businesses are forced to be dynamic and innovative. Considering the current and unforeseen developments in technology, consumption, management and operations, the hotel of tomorrow will not be incrementally but radically different from today. In this context, this article focuses on describing, interpreting and anticipating the changes the hotel industry is expected to face in the coming years.

Five key questions are addressed concerning the skills and abilities of PhD holders: What competencies do researchers have at present? What competencies are currently used? How valuable are they at the present time? Will they be in demand in 10-15 years? And how relevant are these competencies for working on projects in priority areas of science and technology development? Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was based on data collected by two empirical studies conducted in 2010-2013. A survey of researchers and engineers described the issues with competencies related to the areas of science, technology and innovation. Study among 1,884 PhD holders employed in research institutes, universities and enterprises was carried out. In addition, 30 in-depth interviews were also conducted with experts representing the most promising areas of science and technology development in Russia – nanotechnology, biotechnology and the power engineering sectors. Findings: The results from quantitative and qualitative analyses indicate that general competencies such as fundamental theoretical knowledge, ability to work on projects, teamwork and creativity will be in demand in 10-15 years, rather than highly specialized skills. Employers tend to develop needed skills of researchers involved in innovations directly on the workplace, during the realization of a project. Originality/value: This is the first paper to use solid broad statistical evidence to outline a clear idea of the technological and scientific research competencies that would be required in the future. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Engineer; Innovation; Labour market; Researcher; Skill; Technological foresight";"Shmatko, N.; National Research University Higher School of Economics, Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of KnowledgeRussian Federation; email: nshmatko@hse.ru";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-84977551195;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In a number of spheres of policy, it appears uncertainty has intensified in the face of globalisation, economic instability, climate change, technological innovation and changing consumer preferences. How can planners and policymakers plan for an uncertain future? There is growing interest in, and use of, techniques that can help decision-making processes where deep uncertainty is involved. This paper is based upon one of the most recent international examples of a foresight exercise employed to examine uncertainty - specifically that which concerns uncertainty over the nature and extent of future demand for car travel. The principal focus of the paper is on the insights and guidance this examination of uncertainty brings forth for transport planning and policymaking. To accommodate deep uncertainty requires a flexible and open approach in terms of how policy and investment possibilities are formulated and judged. The paper argues for a focus upon the Triple Access System of spatial proximity, physical mobility and digital connectivity as a framework for policy and investment decisions that can harness flexibility and resilience. Uncertainty becomes an opportunity for decision-makers with the realisation that they are shaping the future rather than (only) responding to a predicted future. The paper outlines two forms of policymaking pathway: regime-compliant (in which adherence to trends and the nature of the world we have known pushes policy) and regime-testing (in which the nature of the world as we have known it is brought into question and vision pulls policy decisions). Stronger orientation towards regime-testing to assist in managing an uncertain future is advocated. © 2016 The Authors.;"Accessibility; Future mobility; Peak car; Policymaking pathways; Real options analysis; Uncertainty";"Lyons, G.; Centre for Transport and Society, Faculty of Environment and Technology, University of the West of England, Frenchay Campus, United Kingdom; email: Glenn.Lyons@uwe.ac.uk";Elsevier Ltd;9658564;;;;English;Transp.

To mimic different forecasting skill levels for inflow time series, rest-of-year inflows from regression-based forecasts were blended in different proportions with representative inflows from a spatially distributed hydrologic model. The statistical approach mimics the simpler, historical forecasting approach that is still widely used. Revenue was calculated using historical electricity prices, with perfect price foresight assumed. With current infrastructure and operations, perfect hydrologic forecasts increased annual hydropower revenue by $0.14 to $1.6 million, with lower values in dry years and higher values in wet years, or about $0.8 million (1.2%) on average, representing overall willingness-to-pay for perfect information. A second sensitivity analysis found a wider range of annual revenue gain or loss using different skill levels in snow measurement in the regression-based forecast, mimicking expected declines in skill as the climate warms and historical snow measurements no longer represent current conditions. The value of perfect forecasts was insensitive to storage capacity for small and large reservoirs, relative to average inflow, and modestly sensitive to storage capacity with medium (current) reservoir storage. The value of forecasts was highly sensitive to powerhouse capacity, particularly for the range of capacities in the northern Sierra Nevada. The approach can be extended to multireservoir, multipurpose systems to help guide investments in forecasting. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

In parallel, the key challenge of the pulp and paper industry (PPI) is how to achieve a transformation towards a bioeconomy, as well as to realize the necessary new green innovations. Climate change, material resource scarcity and ecosystem decline are among the ten major sustainability megaforces identified by KPMG (2012), globally influencing business environments. However, the relative importance of these megaforces in the context of pulp and paper sector transformation is yet unknown. We therefore investigate the significance of these megaforces and their relation to the drivers of sustainability-related investments in the European pulp and paper sector, and identify threats and opportunities that these business environmental changes may bring about. Our results are based upon a three-round dissensus-based Delphi approach carried out with a sample of 30 high-level European PPI experts collected in 2014. The panelists identified a greater demand for energy, volatility in the fossil fuel markets and increasing material resource scarcity as the most significant sustainability megaforces shaping European PPI over the next 15 years. However, all the megaforces - except for global ecosystem decline and water scarcity - were perceived more as opportunities rather than threats to European PPI business, indicating that designed energy and environmental policies have the potential to advance a paradigm change towards a bioeconomy rather than curbing the future of the European PPI. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;"Corporate sustainability; Delphi; Foresight; Megatrends; Pulp and paper; Sustainability megaforces";"Toppinen, A.; Department of Forest Sciences, University of Helsinki, P.O.

Referred to as ‘Big Data’, this scientific, social and technological trend has helped create destabilising amounts of information, which can challenge accepted social and ethical norms. Big Data remains a fuzzy idea, emerging across social, scientific, and business contexts sometimes seemingly related only by the gigantic size of the datasets being considered. As is often the case with the cutting edge of scientific and technological progress, understanding of the ethical implications of Big Data lags behind. In order to bridge such a gap, this article systematically and comprehensively analyses academic literature concerning the ethical implications of Big Data, providing a watershed for future ethical investigations and regulations. Particular attention is paid to biomedical Big Data due to the inherent sensitivity of medical information. By means of a meta-analysis of the literature, a thematic narrative is provided to guide ethicists, data scientists, regulators and other stakeholders through what is already known or hypothesised about the ethical risks of this emerging and innovative phenomenon. Five key areas of concern are identified: (1) informed consent, (2) privacy (including anonymisation and data protection), (3) ownership, (4) epistemology and objectivity, and (5) ‘Big Data Divides’ created between those who have or lack the necessary resources to analyse increasingly large datasets. Critical gaps in the treatment of these themes are identified with suggestions for future research. Six additional areas of concern are then suggested which, although related have not yet attracted extensive debate in the existing literature. It is argued that they will require much closer scrutiny in the immediate future: (6) the dangers of ignoring group-level ethical harms; (7) the importance of epistemology in assessing the ethics of Big Data; (8) the changing nature of fiduciary relationships that become increasingly data saturated; (9) the need to distinguish between ‘academic’ and ‘commercial’ Big Data practices in terms of potential harm to data subjects; (10) future problems with ownership of intellectual property generated from analysis of aggregated datasets; and (11) the difficulty of providing meaningful access rights to individual data subjects that lack necessary resources. Considered together, these eleven themes provide a thorough critical framework to guide ethical assessment and governance of emerging Big Data practices. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.";"Big data; Bioethics; Ethical foresight; Ethics; Information ethics; Medical ethics";"Mittelstadt, B.D.; Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, 1 St Giles, United Kingdom; email: brent.mittelstadt@oii.ox.ac.uk";Springer Netherlands;13533452;;;26002496;English;Sci.

A forecast of Russia’s economic growth was constructed based on separate regional strategies, and its basic parameters were assessed. The forecast results from regions’ “collective foresight” are verified. The study is based on materials of publicly available strategies of socioeconomic development drawn up by federal subjects for the period up to 2020–2030. The research methods include collection and systematization of forecasts developed as part of the strategies; bringing of the expected results of implementation of strategies to a comparable form and their aggregation by federal districts; comparative analysis of the consolidated forecasts for federal districts with a comprehensive forecast for Russian economic development based on the interregional input–output model. It is found that optimistic expectations in the forecast for gross regional product growth often lead to overstated estimates that do not coordinate with the required investment. The attainability of the predicted estimates for regional economic development was assessed by spatial input–output model, which can take into account resource constraints and effects of interregional and intersectoral interactions on a nationwide scale. Moderate forecasts are more characteristic of subjects with high levels of economic development. The extent of predominance of excessively optimistic projections over balanced forecasts is indicative of interregional competition for investment resources. The extent of a deficit of labor resources can be estimated by comparing the consolidated demographic forecast and the existing Rosstat forecast. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.";"interregional input–output model; long-term forecast; strategic planning";"Mel’nikova, L.V.; Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of SciencesRussian Federation; email: melnikova@ieie.nsc.ru";Pleiades Publishing;20799705;;;;English;Reg.

Much of government spending is well anticipated over a one year horizon. Once news and surprise shocks are treated as different shocks, there is no depreciation puzzle for news shocks while it is still there for surprise shocks. Fiscal foresight seems to lie at the heart of the different exchange rate responses to news and surprise shocks, depending on the timing of the anticipated budget adjustment following the shock. Indeed, the results are broadly consistent with the prediction of a DSGE model with spending reversals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;"Fiscal foresight; Government spending; News shocks; Non-fundamentalness; Spending reversals; Survey of professional forecasts";"Gambetti, L.; Departament d'Economia i d'Historia Economica, Edifici B, Office B3-1130, Universitat Autònoma de BarcelonaSpain; email: luca.gambetti@uab.cat";Elsevier B.V.;221996;;;;English;J.

Here we present a scenario-building framework based on the Global Business Network (GBN) method to help energy industries to develop more resilient conservation policies when faced with unpredictable and external uncertainties. The approach combines several foresight methods such as Delphi; Political, Economical, Social, and Technological (PEST) analysis, and Cross-Impact Analysis (CIA). In addition, a strategic foresight software program (MICMAC) was applied in the scenario-building phase. The proposed integrated scenario-based robust planning approach builds on the strengths of traditional scenario planning, but overcomes its weaknesses by offering a systematic process for scenario creation and easy implementation. The outcome of this approach is a limited range of core strategies. We use Iran as the case for a more detailed application of the method. Foreign investments in the energy industry, external economic sanctions, and the domestic energy consumption growth were found as the key drivers and critical uncertainties in the Iranian energy industry. Three scenarios based on these critical uncertainties and expert information were developed: Technology-driven, Stagnation, and Self-sufficiency scenario. For these scenarios, a range of robust strategies was determined. National energy efficiency and productivity increases emerged as the key factors for robustness. The main macro-level result was that economic and political drivers will be the most important factors for Iran's energy futures followed by technological and social factors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.";"Energy; Foresight; Iran; Robust planning; Scenario; Strategy";"Alizadeh, R.; Technology Foresight Group, Department of Management, Science and Technology, Amirkabir University of TechnologyIran";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Methods We review the body of literature on the role of episodic foresight in anxiety, from both proximate and ultimate perspectives. Results We propose that anxious feelings associated with episodic simulation of possible threat-related future events serve to imbue these simulations with motivational currency. Episodic and semantic details of a future threat may be insufficient for motivating its avoidance, but anxiety associated with a simulation can provoke adaptive threat management. As such, we detail how anxiety triggered by a self-generated, threat-related future simulation prepares the individual to manage that threat (in terms of its likelihood and/or consequences) over greater temporal distances than observed in other animals. We then outline how anxiety subtypes may represent specific mechanisms for predicting and managing particular classes of fitness threats. Conclusions This approach offers an inroad for understanding the nature of characteristic future thinking patterns in anxiety disorders and serves to illustrate the adaptive function of the mechanism from which clinical anxiety deviates. © 2015 The British Psychological Society.;"anxiety disorders; delay discounting; episodic foresight; evolution; foresight biases; mental time travel; prospection; worry";"Bulley, A.; University of QueenslandAustralia; email: adam.bulley@uqconnect.edu.au";John Wiley and Sons Ltd.;1446657;;BJCPD;25777789;English;Br.

We compare three different expectation mechanisms: Perfect foresight, myopic foresight, and adaptive expectations, focusing, in particular, on this last one. We show that the steady state is the same under each mechanism, and we prove its global stability for perfectly foresighted agents. After investigating local stability conditions under myopic expectations, we study in detail the case of adaptive expectations. We show that, under both reduced rationality mechanisms, if the share of time devoted to labor in the second period of life is large enough, periodic and complex dynamics can occur. Moreover, deepening the investigation through numerical simulations, we study the global stability behavior under adaptive expectations. Such complex scenarios also include the coexistence between the stable steady state and a periodic or chaotic attractor, giving rise to multistability, which does not arise under myopic expectations. Finally, we provide some considerations about the possibility for the agents to improve their forecasts by observing the forecasting error time series. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.;;;American Institute of Physics Inc.;10541500;;;;English;Chaos;2-s2.0-84959568197;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Functionally, intertemporal choices between smaller but immediate and larger but delayed rewards may be made without such episodic foresight. However, we propose that explicit simulations of this sort enable more flexible and adaptive intertemporal decision-making. Emotions triggered through the simulation of future situations can motivate people to forego immediate pleasures in the pursuit of long-term rewards. However, we stress that the most adaptive option need not always be a larger later reward. When the future is anticipated to be uncertain, for instance, it may make sense for preferences to shift toward more immediate rewards, instead. Imagining potential future scenarios and assessment of their likelihood and affective consequences allows humans to determine when it is more adaptive to delay gratification in pursuit of a larger later reward, and when the better strategy is to indulge in a present temptation. We discuss clinical studies that highlight when and how the effect of episodic foresight on intertemporal decision-making can be altered, and consider the relevance of this perspective to understanding the nature of self-control. © 2016 American Psychological Association.;"Delay discounting; Episodic foresight; Evolution; Intertemporal choice; Prospection";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Elasticity allows applications to rapidly change their configuration on-the-fly (e.g., the amount of used resources) in response to dynamic workload fluctuations. In this work we face this problem by adopting the Model Predictive Control technique, a control-theoretic method aimed at finding the optimal application configuration along a limited prediction hori-zon in the future by solving an online optimization problem. Our control strategies are designed to address latency constraints, using Queueing Theory models, and energy consumption by changing the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support available in the modern multicore CPUs. The proactive capabilities, in addition to the latency-and energy-awareness, represent the novel features of our approach. To validate our methodology, we develop a thorough set of experiments on a high-frequency trading application. The re-sults demonstrate the high-degree of flexibility and configurability of our approach, and show the effectiveness of our elastic scaling strategies compared with existing state-of-the-art techniques used in similar scenarios. © 2016 ACM.;"Data Stream Processing; DVFS; Elasticity; Model Predictive Control; Multicore Programming";;Association for Computing Machinery;;9,78E+12;;;English;Proc ACM SIGPLAN Symp Prins Pract Parall Program PPOPP;2-s2.0-84963752273;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Undoubtedly, understanding the future paths of nutrition science in the current era of Big Data remains firmly on science, technology, and innovation strategy agendas around the world. Nutrigenomics, the confluence of nutrition science with genomics, brought about a new focus on and legitimacy for 'variability science' (i.e., the study of mechanisms of person-To-person and population differences in response to food, and the ways in which food variably impacts the host, for example, nutrient-related disease outcomes). Societal expectations, both public and private, and claims over genomics-guided and individually-Tailored precision diets continue to proliferate. While the prospects of nutrition science, and nutrigenomics in particular, are established, there is a need to integrate the efforts in four Big Data domains that are naturally allied-agrigenomics, nutrigenomics, nutriproteomics, and nutrimetabolomics-that address complementary variability questions pertaining to individual differences in response to food-related environmental exposures. The joint use of these four omics knowledge domains, coined as Precision Nutrition 4.0 here, has sadly not been realized to date, but the potentials for such integrated knowledge innovation are enormous. Future personalized nutrition practices would benefit from a seamless planning of life sciences funding, research, and practice agendas from 'farm to clinic to supermarket to society,' and from 'genome to proteome to metabolome.' Hence, this innovation foresight analysis explains the already existing potentials waiting to be realized, and suggests ways forward for innovation in both technology and ethics foresight frames on precision nutrition. We propose the creation of a new Precision Nutrition Evidence Barometer for periodic, independent, and ongoing retrieval, screening, and aggregation of the relevant life sciences data. For innovation in Big Data ethics oversight, we suggest 'nested governance' wherein the processes of knowledge production are made transparent in the continuum from life sciences and social sciences to humanities, and where each innovation actor reports to another accountability and transparency layer: scientists to ethicists, and ethicists to scholars in the emerging field of ethics-of-ethics. Such nested innovation ecosystems offer safety against innovation blind spots, calibrate visible/invisible power differences in the cultures of science or ethics, and ultimately, reducing the risk of 'paper values'-what people say-and 'real values'-what innovation actors actually do. We are optimistic that the convergence of nutrigenomics with nutriproteomics, nutrimetabolomics, and agrigenomics can build a robust, sustainable, and trustworthy precision nutrition 4.0 agenda, as articulated in this Big Data and ethics foresight analysis. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.;;"Özdemir, V.; Faculty of Communications and Office of the President, International Technology and Innovation Policy, Gaziantep UniversityTurkey; email: OJIB@liebertpub.com";Mary Ann Liebert Inc.;15362310;;OMICA;26785082;English;OMICS J.

Data is extracted, transferred, processed, and utilized - be it from wearable devices, refrigerators, or motorcycles. It also spans areas such as public facilities, transportation networks, and major industrial assets. In the sphere of petroleum asset management data analytics is certainly not a new concept. For decades, equipment condition data has been explored and exploited. Internal data networks, repositories, and historians, along with the condition monitoring, predictive diagnostics, and performance optimization applications show a long tradition of utilizing data to gain useful insight. Methods, Procedures, Process: Current asset management technologies can identify what is going on, where, why there are challenges, and how they can be resolved. Yet, new prognostic analytics emphasizes data-driven forecasts addressing ""when"" questions, such as ""When will my compressor have a malfunction?"". Presently, such forecasts have no real proxy in petroleum asset management. The questions ""When will my bearing fail?"", ""When is my last chance for plant revision?"", and ""When will turbine replacement be cheaper than refurbishment?"" are widely asked but rarely answered. Results, Observations, Conclusions: We will review herein which major challenges prognostics faces in the petroleum industry sphere, how they are currently being resolved, and what benefits can be achieved. We present, in addition, a detailed example of an application of prognostics in a petrochemical manufacturing plant. Condition and process data of a cracked gas compressor is utilized to generate remaining useful life distributions and future malfunction risk profiles.

Snøtun H.;Using data to create foresight and create value from volume;2016;Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Western Regional Meeting;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978471949&partnerID=40&md5=592c51a330bab6a36bf80dbf9e1284c1;AGR Software, Norway;Snøtun, H., AGR Software, Norway;;;With the recent downturn in oil price, more of the fields in the arctic seem less financially viable and many projects have been postponed, or altogether abandoned. In an industry where companies are unable to change the market price and cost becomes the main differentiator, projects in the arctic have added worries because of an inhospitable climate, lack of infrastructure and severe environmental concerns. This means that companies have to plan better, but also plan differently in the arctic in order to stay competitive. All planning should be data driven with a focus on learning from past experiences and projects, but how one handles data determines how much value can be extracted from volume, and how much insight and foresight one can expect. We have found that there are four main obstacles to using data effectively. Firstly, it can be hard to find the correct data, but even more importantly, it can be hard to determine what data is missing. By some estimates, geologists use 60% of their time looking for data and less than 20% looking for oil. Secondly, even though a lot of data is sometimes available, the data might not be accessible, and a lot of time is lost in planning from converting esoteric formats, different units of measure and a plethora of curve values. The third obstacle to use data is that the context for the data might be missing, which is even more important in the arctic, because it might be hard to determine if experiences obtained in one area can be transferred to arctic projects. Finally, data is often aggregated before the planning stage it might hard because of time constraints to investigate whether anomalies in the data is caused by error in the data or outliers that can add risk or cost to the project. We will show how efficient use of Big Data techniques and statistical analysis can mediate the effects mentioned above, and how normalization and standardization of data can allow users to spend their time interpreting data. Although the use of data does not eliminate risk, it can help manage it by identifying which risks should be focused on, but also identify where the project moves into uncharted territory in terms of equipment, location, rig or other factors.

The phenomenon concerns the availability and accessibility of large stream of data from diverse sources including those from social media networks. Analyzing these data provides foresights and insights for better decision making. This paper attempts to identify those business organizations that have committed substantial investments in information technology (IT) and business intelligence (BI) initiatives and are able to take advantage of the resultant knowledge and insights due to successful implementation of BI initiatives. Data were collected from 132 larger scale business organizations from Malaysia. The results indicated that larger organizations in terms of sales revenue, number of employees employed, and number of IT/BI employees employed tend to be more successful in BI initiatives implementation (measured in terms of BI maturity level). There was also correlation between duration of BI implementation and BI maturity level, although we did not find significant difference in BI maturity level between the types of industry. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.;"BI initiative implementation; Business intelligence; Data analytics; Maturity level";"Luen, W.K.; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Perak Campus, Malaysia; email: wongkl@utar.edu.my";IEOM Society;21698767;9,78E+12;;;English;Proc.

The goal is achieved by formulating the problem as a series of finite-horizon mixed integer linear programs (MILPs), each with a limited, partial foresight on future inflows. The MINLPs are then solved sequentially over a long-run planning horizon for determining the minimum reservoir capacity required for meeting a specified reservoir yield at a certain level of reliability. The results indicate although it is generally true that the required reservoir capacity will increase if the foresight on future inflows becomes more limited, an opposite result is also possible to occur depending on the system's characteristics and hydrology. Moreover, knowing about future inflows does not help any more after a certain level of foresight horizon. These findings provide insight into the issue of uncertainty of future inflows and their forecasts in the design and operation of reservoir systems. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As such, it addresses two distinct gaps in foresight knowledge and literature namely the link between foresight and entrepreneurship; and longitudinal assessments of foresight activities in specific policy areas. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of foresight on entrepreneurship over a long term perspective. In 1993, the results of an eighteen month foresight visioning exercise, Wales 2010, were published. It set out an enterprise vision built on engaging the ideas and views of a range of economic and social actors, and recommended a programme of interventions to help develop an entrepreneurship culture. Seven years after the setting of this vision, the Entrepreneurship Action Plan was developed, the first of its kind in Europe. Over the following years to 2005, entrepreneurial activity in Wales grew significantly outpacing the UK as a whole. However, a loss of focus on entrepreneurship in the years between 2005 and 2011, due to institutional factors and a lack of foresight renewal, was accompanied by a decline in entrepreneurial activity, which has only recently recovered. Wales 2010 created a foresight legacy: the foresight exercise was an antecedent to the development of entrepreneurship policy and to notable growth in entrepreneurial activity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.";"Case study; Entrepreneurship; Foresight; Impact; Longitudinal; Policy";"Rhisiart, M.; South Wales Business School, University of South WalesUnited Kingdom; email: martin.rhisiart@southwales.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The authors review the major trends of global value chains' development, specific features of Russia's participation in them, and the necessary steps to increase the quality and efficiency of this participation, in particular in the changing geopolitical context. Special attention was paid to the theoretical, methodological, and empirical aspects of GVC research which are far from adequate (we primarily mean international databases such as TiVA and WIOD developed with the participation of the OECD and the WTO): they need to be supplemented with advanced tools to improve their forecasting potential, as well as their practical and strategic orientation. To this end, approaches which would make it possible to research the interconnections between global processes and trends with regional and national innovation-based development tendencies become of crucial importance. The application of Foresight methodology may significantly contribute to researching the GVC phenomenon, being a major logical step towards creating advanced research and policy tools to mobilise available resources and coordinate stakeholders' actions to increase global competitiveness. The paper presents several case studies which describe the practical application of Foresight methodology to analyze Russian participation in various GVCs, giving examples of specific product and service groups. The authors conclude that both full-scale Foresight studies and specific components thereof could be applied for the purposes of GVC analysis, strategic planning, and political decision making. © 2015 National Research University Higher School of Economics.;"Competition; Foresight; Global value-added chains (GVCs); Globalization; Innovation; Trade";;National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics;23129972;;;;English;Foresight STI Gov.;2-s2.0-84983147514;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, planners will always need to prepare for uncertain futures, and understand driving forces and global trends that affect future urban mobility. In this paper, we present an ongoing foresight study on Singapore’s urban transport and mobility up to 2030. Our objectives are to develop a shared understanding of the current state of the transportation system, highlight long-term challenges and opportunities, and establish networks between stakeholders. Through environmental scanning and expert interviews, our preliminary findings indicate that mobility-on-demand services, multi-modal transport, and e-commerce are the dominant future drivers of change in the urban mobility landscape. In addition, ageing population, growing population and travel demand, inefficiencies in urban freight, shortage in skilled manpower, and a general resistance to big policy changes are the key challenges facing Singapore urban mobility in future. Finally, in terms of technology, autonomous vehicles, real-time traveller information, and shared mobility are seen as potential game-changers for the future. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.;;"Zahraei, S.M.; Engineering Systems and Design, Singapore University of Technology and Design, 8 Somapah Road, Singapore; email: zahraei@sutd.edu.sg";Springer Verlag;21945357;9,78E+12;;;English;Adv.

In recent years, increased computational power and data availability have led to the emergence of new techniques that are potentially useful for foresight and forecasting. As a result, there are now many techniques that might be used in FTA exercises. This paper reviews and qualifies quantitative methods for FTA in order to help users to make choices among alternative techniques, including new techniques that have not yet been integrated into the FTA literature and practice. We first provide a working definition of FTA and discuss its role, uses, and popularity over recent decades. Second, we select the most important quantitative FTA techniques, discuss their main contexts and uses, and classify them into groups with common characteristics, positioning them along key dimensions: descriptive/ prescriptive, extrapolative/normative, data gathering/inference, and forecasting/foresight. © The Author 2016.

We also reveal that – on average – the longer the maturity, the greater the term premium, both in the boom and in the recession. The other significant feature of the term premia for all maturities is that the boom premia are many times smaller than their recession counterparts. For the maturities of 35 weeks and over, the yield spread is a good predictor of future changes in the short interest rate. For other maturities it turns out to be a downwards biased predictor. Except for the two shortest maturities, all restricted perfect foresight spread regressions, i.e. those ignoring the change of premia with the business cycle and their breaks, are misspecified. © 2016 Wrocław University of Economics.;"Expectations hypothesis; Fourier approximation; Perfect foresight spread; Term structure of interest rates; Time-varying term premium; US dollar LIBORs";"Miłobędzki, P.; Department of Econometrics, Faculty of Management, University of GdańskPoland";Wroclaw University of Economics;12335835;;;;English;Argum.

That study defined three scenarios likely to shape the innovation process in coming years. One of those scenarios was the Hollywood model, in which scientists, engineers, and innovators no longer work for a single firm but rather contract out their services to individual projects and then move on to other projects and companies. Over the course of six months, an IRI Research working group conducted four workshops with R&D leaders at IRI member companies to explore how talent management would be affected in this scenario. The workshops identified challenges and opportunities associated with the Hollywood model as a paradigm for industrial R&D, focused around eight critical aspects of current talent management practice. Although the Hollywood model faces significant infrastructure and legal impediments today, its employment of external R&D workers with diverse experiences and perspectives is likely to create a greater opportunity for significant innovation. © 2016, Industrial Research Institute.;"Futures; Hollywood model; IRI research; IRI2038; Talent management";;Taylor and Francis Inc.;8956308;;RTMAE;;English;Res Technol Manage.;2-s2.0-85038076789;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The process of technology foresight has become a growing need for organizations to keep up with the significant and rapid changes of technology in their core business and to better understand its business impact in order to support their decision making process. This paper will focus on functional textiles, an emergent sector amongst the textiles industry with a high economic potential, in which there are several opportunities for the development of new products and the creation of added value based on multifunctional effects for new technical applications. This sector, also called smart textiles, offers a versatile framework for incorporating sensing, monitoring, and information processing devices that enables smart textiles to sense and react to environmental conditions or stimuli. This sector is a clear priority for the future of textiles and clothing in the developed countries. The functional textiles sector encompasses, the fiber itself, the fabric, the textile finishing and new materials applied in fiber of fabrics as well. Their applications are broad, such as in the aerospace industry, in the medical area, on sustainable construction, in the military equipment, on the sports goods, etc. A survey of the scientific and technological developments in functional textiles was carried out, using patents and scientific papers with the time frame from the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2014 in order to identify technological trends. This encompasses the right selection of databases, the establishment of the search strategy and keywords to be applied, the screening of the retrieved information and the analysis and consolidation of all data gathered. A list of emergent technologies was created based on the mentioned survey and used to generate a questionnaire that was assessed by a panel of Brazilian experts in a two round Delphi method approach. Experts were asked, among other questions, to judge the diffusion rate of each technology in Brazil in the next five years and in the next fifteen years, as well as to appraise the conditions of local production in the next fifteen years. This paper will present the preliminary results of this Delphi panel, aiming to create a basis for understanding how companies in this sector can explore more efficiently the technological opportunities, as well as identifying constraints and shortcomings to implement these technologies in Brazil.;"Delphi; Multifunctional Textiles; Patents; Technology foresight";;International Association for Management of Technology Conference (IAMOT) and the Graduate School of Technology Management, University of Pretoria;;"0981581781; 9780981581781";;;English;IAMOT - Int.

Our study develops a unified sequential model that elucidates the complexities, processes and factors that lead to dissolution. We illustrate our theoretical analysis using the contemporary case of ST-Ericsson's (2009-2013) dissolution. Our study uncovered three distinct stages in the disbandment process. These stages provide insights on declaration of intent, forming of the dissolution team, distribution of assets and liabilities, and the aftermath. Our study highlights how an entrepreneurial venture so well-conceived can eventually dissolve after few years in operations.

Climatic changes are correlated with the degradation of biosphere. It is a question of saving life on our planet. We should begin taking strong measures, else Earth has a chance to repeat the destiny of Mars and Venus, as some scientists are afraid of. So reasoning like “When will it be and will it be at all” is for lazy, careless and selfish people. Now, because of the industrial emission of greenhouse gases, the temperature of the atmosphere is growing, the climate is changing: sudden temperature differences, snowfalls where it used to be impossible, thickness of arctic ice decrease is about 40% (a great ice-hole has been found on the north pole), repetition of droughts has increased in 8 times, power of hurricanes – 2 times, increased power of floods. This is the result of lack of foresight, over-materialism and greediness, unwillingness to see the consequences because of the momentary advantages. How it is possible to trap CO2, SO2 and other gases? Commercially gas purification at thermoelectric power stations, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy plants, cement and chemical plants is being made with filters and cyclones, that trap solid parts, and using different absorptive and adsorptive methods. Unfortunately at present there is no effective method of CO2 trapping. © SGEM2016.;"Carbon dioxide trapping; Climate change; Direct osmosis; Greenhouse gases";;International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference;13142704;"9786197105568; 9786197105599; 9786197105629; 9786197105643; 9786197105667; 9786197105698";;;English;Int.

Taking into consideration the speed with which changes are happening nowadays authors are pointing that intellectual skills are the only resource that allows to cope with the speed with which new knowledge is created nowadays. That’s why one of the crucial ways to develop workforce potential is to advance its “intellectualization” - intellectual skills and modern education is supposed to solve this task. The main goals of society and state in creating strategic workforce potential consist in long-term educational goals and strategy setting the way that take in consideration the ever accelerating pace of technologic lifestyle, forecasts and foresights in economy, social life, basic sciences and technologies; uniform national approach to motivation; higher education and corresponding additional courses modification in terms of both form and content. © 2016, Econjournals.

Design/methodology/approach: A study based on a quantitative approach has been designed. Data have been collected through closed questionnaires from a sample of firms. The study has been conducted in the electronics industry in Italy based on the dynamism of the setting. Through SPSS-AMOS application, path analysis has been performed to conduct a first assessment of the theoretical model. Findings: The dimensions of strategic agility are relevant capabilities for improving competitive activity. Furthermore, increasing strategic agility in the three dimensions (customer, operational and partnering) depends on the ability to improve other dynamic capabilities of the organization, including IT competency, systematic insight and strategic foresight. Finally, strategic agility results to be the only variable able to leverage the firm’s competitive activity. Research limitations/implications: The study presents some limitations linked to the response rate and the ability to conduct further analysis. However, it highlights the main dimensions that managers and entrepreneurs should develop to improve the competitive activities of the firm. Practical implications: The paper addresses practitioners’ need to identify the main variable to leverage in order to increase firms’ competitivity. Social implications: The results of the study offer the opportunity for new reflections when designing business executives’ training programs and defining recruitment pathways.

To identify the drivers of disease emergence, we analyzed infectious disease threat events (IDTEs) detected through epidemic intelligence collected at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) between 2008 and 2013, and compared the observed results with a 2008 ECDC foresight study of projected drivers of future IDTEs in Europe. Among 10 categories of IDTEs, foodborne and waterborne IDTEs were the most common, vaccine-preventable IDTEs caused the highest number of cases, and airborne IDTEs caused the most deaths. Observed drivers for each IDTE were sorted into three main groups: globalization and environmental drivers contributed to 61% of all IDTEs, publichealth system drivers contributed to 21%, and social and demographic drivers to 18%. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that four of the top five drivers for observed IDTEs were in the globalization and environment group. In the observational study, the globalization and environment group was related to all IDTE categories, but only to five of eight categories in the foresight study. Directly targeting these drivers with public health interventions may diminish the chances of IDTE occurrence from the outset. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.";"Drivers; Epidemic; Infectious diseases; Pandemic; Threat";;Blackwell Publishing Inc.;778923;;ANYAA;27434370;English;Ann.

In Russia 'Rapid Foresight' technique was worked out by Agency of Strategic Initiative and now it is quite actively used. Several Profession Atlas versions showing expert opinions of professional societies about the changes which may appear in the structure and quality of personnel in different spheres in remote future were developed with the helpof Rapid Foresight Technology usage. With the help of 'Rapid Foresight' technique perspectives for education and service sphere professions and personnel competencies were developed. On the base of the present technique the authors of the article have carried out an investigation on robotization trend in service and tourism spheres. The investigation showed that the opinions of employers and educational institutes' representatives are splitted into two equal parts: one half thinks that in service robotization will prevail and the other half says that the human factor will predominate. Hence, the results of New York Federal Reserve Bank investigation, which forecasted the growth of non-routine labor and connected with that crucial necessity for such catering, service, hospitality and tourism personnel competencies as thought flexibility, ability to settle non-typical problems and use of creative approach in servicing clients.

It describes how the early detection of medium- to long-term developments in the broader business environment, including social and market developments, is integrated into innovation and strategy processes. The purpose of this paper is to give an account of foresight practice in an automotive company that (1) covers the full range of roles and practices of a mature foresight group, (2) describes case examples how such roles and practices are played out in practice and (3) concludes with general recommendations for organizational design and processes. The paper highlights five major fields of foresight practice which encompass strategic issues in different working fields: early detection in new business environments, trend research for the generation of product innovations, prospective evaluation of innovation ideas, exploration and development of new business, and cross-functional dissemination of future-related issues. Practice examples in each field detail features of the integration of foresight in corporate processes. The paper finishes with characterizing the organizational architecture of a mature corporate foresight group, a discussion and overall conclusions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Automotive business; Business environment; Corporate foresight; Future research; Innovation management; Strategic planning";"Ruff, F.; Daimler AG, Society and Technology Research Group, Mahdentalstr. 96, Germany; email: frank.ruff@daimler.com";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In this regard, identification of strong and weak aspects of Foresight design and implementation, a quality of outputs and a degree of impact as well as learning from this practice is of great importance. Strong evaluation procedures contribute to further Foresight development and its effectiveness.Literature analysis reveals the diversity of different approaches and criteria for Foresight evaluation at the national level however its basic principles are not yet consolidated and spread for use. The purpose of this paper is to start such consolidation through the development of an integrated approach for ex-post national Foresight evaluation.

The paper proposes an organizational futurist role as an internal champion and broker to facilitate the integration process. It builds on the direct experience of one of the authors in crafting the role by revisiting and critically reviewing the papers reporting on findings from that experience. A literature review is then used to reflect on the gaps identified and to stimulate new conceptualizations in order to ground the role in a more suitable academic approach. The paper proposes several tangible approaches for how an organizational futurist role might respond to three principal challenges to the integration of foresight identified and confirmed by a review of the literature. The paper concludes with a research agenda to explore those approaches. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Corporate foresight; Foresight; Integration; Organizational futurist";"Hines, A.; University of Houston, 4800 Calhoun Rd, 110 Cameron Building, United States; email: ahines@uh.edu";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Foresight is believed to be having a positive impact on triggering organisational ambidexterity, especially explorative (radical) innovation. Very little empirical research has been done so far to test the probability of this theory with higher constraint designs. This paper reports on the results of a survey involving 230 manufacturing companies in Lithuania. It confirms the importance of organisational foresight, recognising its contribution to both explorative and exploitative innovations, i.e. organisational ambidexterity. Based on a conceptual model that describes organisational foresight as a set of environmental scanning, strategic selection and integrating capabilities, this paper proposes testable measures of organisational foresight. We empirically test the model and provide evidence to the theoretical relationship between organisational foresight and organisational ambidexterity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Capabilities; Exploitation; Exploration; Organisational ambidexterity; Organisational foresight";"Paliokaite, A.Kestučio st. 4/14, Lithuania; email: paliagne@stud.ism.lt";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Strategic management, specifically the dynamic capabilities approach and vast literature on corporate and strategic foresight argue that deficiencies like one-dimensionality, narrow-sightedness and myopia of closed corporate processes are remedied by incorporating external sources. A broad knowledge base promises to especially benefit foresight in multiple ways. Thus, created an analytical framework that integrates the dynamic capabilities approach with existing results on potential value contributions of foresight, enriched with existing findings in networked foresight and organizational design in the light increasing importance of inter-organizational networks. We conducted a series of interviews and a survey among foresight practitioners in a network to explore the perceived value proposition of networked foresight for the network partners and the network itself. The analysis is based on data drawn from the EIT ICT Labs network of large industry corporations, small-and-medium sized companies, and academic and research institutes. Our study shows that network partners use the results primarily for sensing activities, i.e. data collection and to a lesser extend activity initiation. More sensitive and fundamental organizational aspects such as strategy and decision-making or path-dependency are less affected. Especially SMEs may benefit substantially from network approaches to foresight whereas MNEs are more confident in their existing corporate foresight processes and results. The value for the network itself is substantial and goes beyond value creation potential for companies as discussed in literature. The development of a shared vision-relatable to organizational learning and reconfiguration capabilities-was identified as particularly valuable for the network. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Collaboration for innovation; Corporate foresight; Dynamic capabilities; Innovation networks; Networked foresight; Open innovation";"Heger, T.; Chair for Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship, University of Potsdam, August-Bebel-Straße 89, Germany; email: tobias.heger.ac@googlemail.com";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Box 800, Groningen, 9700 AV, Netherlands";;;The goal of this introductory article to the Special Issue on Corporate Foresight is to provide an overview of the state of the art, major challenges and to identify development trajectories. We define corporate foresight as a practice that permits an organization to lay the foundation for a future competitive advantage. Historically we distinguish and discuss four main phases: 1) birth of the field (1950s), 2) the age of scenarios (1960s-1970s), 3) professionalization (1980s-1990s), and 4) organizational integration (2000-). A systematic literature search revealed 102 articles on foresight, 29 of them on corporate foresight. Based on these articles and those in this Special Issue, we identify four main themes. Two more mature themes, namely 'organizing corporate foresight', and 'individual and collective cognition', and two emerging themes 'corporate foresight in networked organizations', and 'quantifying value contributions'. In the conclusion we make a plea for establishing corporate foresight as a separate research stream that can adopt various theoretical foundations from a number of general management research traditions. To help the field move forward we identify three areas in which corporate foresight research can build on theoretical notions in general management, and can contribute to such on-going debates. © 2015.;"Corporate foresight; Historical development; Review; Strategic foresight";"Rohrbeck, R.; Aarhus University, Business and Social Sciences, Department of Management, Bartholins Allé 10, Denmark; email: rrohr@mgmt.au.dk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

We seek to deepen this understanding by applying a cognitive lens. We mainly explore how and why foresight can influence ways of processing information, first conceptually and then empirically through the case of the Cisco Technology Radar. Through consulting multiple individuals, opposed to focusing solely on statements from top managers or observable outputs on the firm level, we uncover a broad set of ""hidden values"" from this technology foresight initiative. We conclude that a critical mechanism of a system such as the radar is its probing of analytical thinking, as well as its way of making people connect and exchange views across functions and departments. We also observe that deeper and more frequent involvement corresponds with greater perceived value of the system. Our findings have implications for research seeking to further understand through which mechanisms foresight creates value, and for the practice of designing, implementing and motivating for participation in technology foresight. © 2014 The Authors.";"Cognition; Decision-making; Dual process theory; Mental models; Organizational future orientation; Technology foresight; Technology radar";"Boe-Lillegraven, S.Bartholins allé 10, Denmark; email: Siri@badm.au.dk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

This joint project investigated several cases according to a set of criteria and compared the content. The aim of the project was mutual learning and the results revealed that the differences can be found on different levels like the understanding of the terminology (not only language), cultural understandings, the background of the innovation system and contexts of the roadmaps and the understanding of the objectives. The way the process is performed differed significantly whereas the differences in the processes themselves, the number of participants or the topic fields were rather similar.

This research advances knowledge on the practice of foresight in long-term planning through a comparative analysis of planning approaches in two organisations linked through common ownership. Data generated from planning documentation and the foresight practice of strategy personnel in the two cases (transport and banking) provided support for a dynamic model of foresight integrated LT planning. The ongoing collection and synthesis of strong and weak signals, and their continual assimilation into scenarios depicting alternative futures was structurally supported by a community-of-practice. The community-of-practice widely engaged strategists located across organisational levels in conversations about emerging futures and about strategies through which to engage those futures. The findings encourage managers and researchers to view long-term planning as an ongoing interrogation of implemented and envisioned strategies within emerging, alternative futures. Such an approach stimulates strategic entrepreneurship and prepares the organisation for engaging in future environments. © 2013.;"Community-of-practice; Foresight; Long-term planning";"Jarratt, D.G.; School of Business, University of Western Sydney, Parramatta Campus ED G:43, Locked Bag 1797, Australia; email: d.jarratt@uws.edu.au";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The main objective is not to determine where to invest but how to help agents to discover where to invest in a decentralised and bottom-up logic. The methodology accepted in Lithuania departs from the traditional approach to priority setting focused on identification of research fields or economy sectors, and builds on the concepts of long term challenges and critical technologies. Choosing challenge-based priorities allows to better develop synergies and integrated policies, thus reducing fragmentation. A mixed qualitative and quantitative method approach is applied, including the expert panels, surveys, statistical and bibliometrical analysis, roadmaps, and analytical studies on the emerging trends and long term challenges. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.;"Entrepreneurial discovery; Foresight; Long term challenges; Research and innovation priorities; Smart specialisation";"Paliokaite, A.; Visionary Analytics, JSC, Kestučio st. 4/14, Lithuania; email: agne@visionary.lt";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

It uses a structured FTA approach to offer guidance for the design of foresight exercises supporting such priority setting, drawing on the case of S&T cooperation between EU Member States, countries associated to the FP7, and Russia. A framework is proposed for thematic priority setting through the application of Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA) and for achieving clear policy impacts by including principles for impact optimisation. A combination of foresight methodologies such as expert workshops, a Delphi survey, roadmapping elements, and prioritisation techniques was applied to select relevant topics for a joint research call. The paper shows how foresight can be embedded in a multilateral S&T programme cooperation using a set of coordination dimensions and design principles. Strategies for achieving policy impact and for communicating foresight results are also outlined.

With increasing unpredictability, under pressure of time and in multi-agency situations, however, traditional foresight and strategic management fail. In this paper, we redefine a foresight process for real time network management instructed by the extreme case of collaboration in global disaster management. We use an actor-network approach to explore on global and local levels emerging networks. We find that ad hoc and long term network dynamics are governance structures for unpredictable collaboration just as traditional goal setting and targeting is conducive to stable environments. Altogether five dynamic network patterns are found that underlie successful ad hoc collaboration: (1) identification of heterogeneous network actors and early alignment of interests (2) development of a shared vision for heterogeneous goals (3) use of boundary objects (4) punctual directness and distance among implementing actors (5) intense local integration of the focal actor. Governmental decision makers, corporate actors and voluntary associations who are cognisant of dynamic network patterns can use them for rapid collaboration instead of long-range foresight and constituent planning. To base leadership on dynamic network principles instead of traditional strategic management means to adopt a new real-time foresight for collaborative innovation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.;"Collaborative innovation; Dynamic network principles; Real time foresight; Sustainable global relief";"Weber, C.; SCE, University of Applied ScienceGermany; email: christina.weber@sce.de";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

A variety of foresight tools are in place to support top management's strategic decision-making. However, leaders cannot claim to have the full scope of knowledge and capabilities required for creating a long-term, robust and implementable strategy. Today, many experts with the relevant detailed knowledge about future developments and organisational capabilities can be found in middle management, which needs to be reflected in an integrative approach towards strategy development.In this paper, an approach is presented that describes how a foresight-based strategy development approach can be designed in order to leverage the potential of middle management. This approach is applied in strategy development to the supply chain management of a multinational manufacturing company. The case focuses on Asia, and includes 37 middle managers plus their staff - totalling approximately 70 employees - from 13 countries. The results indicate that top and middle management were willing to follow the highly structured process, contributing to strategy development in terms of ideas, data, time, resources and analytical work. The developed strategy integrated the middle management's perspective successfully and strategy implementation started immediately. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Corporate foresight; Middle management; Scenarios; Strategy development; Strategy-as-practice";"Darkow, I.-L.; Department of Business Studies and Economics, University BremenGermany; email: Darkow@uni-bremen.de";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

To this end, Shaping Future has developed an original participatory foresight methodology that is centred on design know-how and promotes innovative forms of preference articulation.This paper presents the approaches and findings that guided the project and its results, including the developed methodology.

Hyperopia is a metaphorical term adopted from ocular science referring to long-sightedness-a condition of being able to focus clearly on that which is far away but not that which is nearby. Managerial hyperopia describes a managerial approach that focuses with acuity on that which is far off (temporally, spatially or cognitively) whilst failing to interpret and manage that which is close at hand. Hyperopia is pathology of a managerial approach that habitually favours the long term to the extent that the short-term is marginalised. Hyperopia is thus distinct from far-sightedness, or foresight, which is an understanding of that which is to come about. As a response to environmental flux, the emergence of managerial hyperopia contradicts existing theory which predicts short-sighted managerial responses. Based on longitudinal empirical evidence from a single qualitative case study we argue that managerial hyperopia can emerge from an over-emphasis on foresight activities in a top management team in a period of time considered as turbulent. Further, we suggest that without counterbalancing operational attention, goal-oriented foresight activities may compound this and unintentionally lead to detrimental organizational performance in the here and now. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresightful learning; Hyperopia; Myopia; Scenario planning; Unintended consequences";"Burt, G.; Stirling Management School, University of Stirling, Cottrell Building, United Kingdom; email: george.burt@stir.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

A variety of methods have been developed to support and improve the technological scanning process but the success of corporate foresight activities depends initially and heavily on the quality of information processing at the 'front end of innovation'. Since this information activity involves individual members of the organization it is important to examine the general cognitive and intuitive abilities of these individuals. In order to enrich existing knowledge in this context, this paper explores the technology identification and evaluation process from a psychological standpoint, looking in particular at the concept of cognitive prototypes and intuition of technological gatekeepers. The findings of this study show that technological gatekeepers possess specific cognitive prototype models and thinking patterns, which exert an influence on identification and evaluation of technologies and that the number of features a thinking pattern contains is correlated with the number of years spent in a position in the organization as technological gatekeeper. Our exploration of the role of intuition also highlighted a discrepancy between the individual and the organization. While it is perceived on an individual level as a valuable tool, it is seen by technological gatekeepers as inappropriate on an organizational level. As a result, gut feeling is not always acknowledged or communicated within the organization in the technology identification and evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;"Cognitive prototype; Corporate foresight; Gut feeling; Technological gatekeeper; Technology evaluation; Technology identification";"Scheiner, C.W.; Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Lange Gasse 20, Germany; email: christian.scheiner@fau.de";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

However, relatively little attention has been devoted to what and how individuals - such as managers and strategists - learn from participation within strategic scenario processes. The paper focuses on the learning effects of scenario processes on participants, using the Futures Literacy Hybrid Strategic Scenario (FL HSS) method. It presents an evaluative framework for capturing the learning and cognitive effects of using the imaginary future, and the learning benefits derived by participants in intensive scenario processes. The paper outlines how scenario activities change the capabilities of the individuals and organizational systems to understand the nature and role of the future for what they perceive and what they do. Cognition is the domain of the individual rather than the organization and, as a result, the micro processes through which individuals learn and challenge mental models appear to be antecedent resources to collective mental model changes within organizations. This suggests that companies should invest in pedagogically rich scenario processes that develop the capability of managers to sense changes. The learning generated by scenario processes can strengthen the 'sensing' dynamic capabilities of firms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Learning; Scenarios; Strategic foresight";"Rhisiart, M.; South Wales Business School, University of South WalesUnited Kingdom; email: martin.rhisiart@southwales.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Wind energy production has become an interesting option for alpine regions. In addition to grid reliability, public acceptance is an important factor that currently limits wind energy's market penetration.An interdisciplinary research team explored, through socio-economic and technical approaches, the current and future acceptance of wind energy production in the Swiss energy region of Goms, an alpine valley at 1300. m above sea level. The focus of this paper is on research questions comprising future societal challenges for the local population. For this purpose, the focus-group discussion has proven to be a valuable participatory method.Concerning future development of wind energy in the Alps, regional value creation (including workplaces) and the placement of systems where man-made infrastructure is already present were the main visions mentioned by workshop participants.So far, wind energy as implemented in the valley of Goms has not been perceived as a topic of conflict by the local community. Crucial components towards local acceptance of wind turbines are questions of aesthetics, technical performance and economic feasibility. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.;"Focus group; Future energy generation; Local acceptance; Participatory foresight; Societal challenges; Wind energy";"Spiess, H.; Institute of Sustainable Development at ZHAW Zurich University of Applied SciencesSwitzerland; email: spha@zhaw.ch";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Civil security technologies and their implementation are generally characterized by high complexity, multi-stakeholder involvement and a high level of regulation. Due to these characteristics and the influence of societal aspects, it is extremely difficult to evaluate the future developments and applications of emerging security technologies. This is why only a small number of studies have addressed this issue so far and empirical insights into these aspects are still scarce. Our paper addresses this research gap by applying scenarios to consider different societal aspects and their impacts on emerging security technologies and their applications. Based on quantitative and qualitative data and are used as the evaluation background for emerging security technologies. The results show that this approach is suitable to consider technological and non-technological drivers and barriers, and to derive measures and recommendations.

We estimate a threshold vector autoregression (TVAR) model on US quarterly data for the period 1984-2010. We employ the spread between BAA-rated corporate bond yield and 10-year treasury constant maturity rate as a proxy for credit conditions. We find that the response of output to fiscal policy shocks is stronger and more persistent when the economy is in the 'tight' credit regime. Fiscal multipliers are significantly different in the two regimes: they are abundantly and persistently higher than one when firms face increasing financing costs, whereas they are feebler and often lower than one in the 'normal' credit regime. The results appear to be robust to different model specifications, fiscal foresight, alternative threshold variables, different measure of variables and sample periods. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;;"Fagiolo, G.; Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Institute of Economics and Laboratory of Economics and Management, Piazza Martiri della Libertà 33, Italy; email: giorgio.fagiolo@sssup.it";John Wiley and Sons Ltd;8837252;;;;English;J.

Today, it includes both qualitative and quantitative elements. The aims of this scoping review are to give an overview of the application of the scenario method in the fields of health care and to make suggestions for better reporting in future scenario projects. Methods: Between January 2013 and October 2013 we conducted a systematic search in the databases Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Eric, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cinahl since inception for the term 'scenario(s)' in combination with other terms, e.g. method, model, and technique. Our search was not restricted by date or language. In addition, we screened the reference lists of the included articles. Results: A total of 576 bibliographical records were screened. After removing duplicates and three rounds of screening, 41 articles covering 38 different scenario projects were included for the final analysis. Nine of the included articles addressed disease related issues, led by mental health and dementia (n∈=∈4), and followed by cancer (n∈=∈3). Five scenario projects focused on public health issues at an organizational level and five focused on the labor market for different health care professionals. In addition, four projects dealt with health care 'in general', four with the field of biotechnology and personalized medicine, and additional four with other technology developments. Some of the scenario projects suffered from poor reporting of methodological aspects. Conclusions: Despite its potential, use of the scenario method seems to be published rarely in comparison to other methods such as the Delphi-technique, at least in the field of health care. This might be due to the complexity of the methodological approach. Individual project methods and activities vary widely and are poorly reported. Improved criteria are required for reporting of scenario project methods. With improved standards and greater transparency, the scenario method will be a good tool for scientific health care planning and strategic decision-making in public health. © 2015 Vollmar et al.;"Decision-making; Forecasting; Foresight; Health planning; Planning techniques; Policy making; Public health administration; Scenario method";"Vollmar, H.C.; Institute of General Practice, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, Germany";BioMed Central Ltd.;14712288;;;26475601;English;BMC Med.

This aspiration inevitably resonates with technology developers and suppliers, yet is only valid if 'smart' is truly smart and not doing what we already do more efficiently - there is an imperative to re-engineer our cities to live within what our planet can provide and protect it for future generations, while prioritizing peoples' wellbeing. Herein lies the greater, more inspiring, challenge, and one that provides the focus for sensor technology development. This paper outlines the Liveable Cities and UK Foresight Future of Cities projects, and a method for future-proofing proposed urban interventions. However, the above neglects the existing fabric of our cities - the context in which new interventions must operate effectively. This is where remote sensing, and GPR in particular, has a crucial role to play. Mapping the Underworld, and it successor Assessing the Underworld, make explicit GPR's potential and, crucially, shifts the focus of attention from buried pipes and cables to the road structure and the ground (which supports them both). The research is predicated on the potential for combined sensors, deployed at the surface and in-pipe, to reveal the layout and condition of the urban shallow subsurface. An intelligent combination of widespread instrumentation and remote sensing could move cities towards a far more sustainable and resilient, and therefore truly smart, future - GPR is a core part of this future. © 2015 IEEE.;"asset management; future cities; infrastructure";"Rogers, C.D.F.; University of Birmingham, School of Civil EngineeringUnited Kingdom; email: c.d.f.rogers@bham.ac.uk";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;9,78E+12;;;English;Int.

The integration of capital markets is seen as one such area of transformation. The research presented in this article studies one integration initiative that took shape around the proposed combination of a number of key European securities marketplaces through the development of a cross-border settlement system. Taking a sociotechnical approach, the research presents the positions of the key actants identified in relation to key controversies regarding the development of the settlement system and shows how the relations between the controversies and the positions of the actants involved in them evolve. By examining the role of ICTs in the evolution of these relations, the study seeks to illuminate the complex causalities between the social and technical aspects of cross-border capital market integration. The article argues that in addition to enabling the interconnecting of an expanded set of transacting parties, ICTs bring important cognitive dimensions that enable the inspiration, planning, and foresight necessary for both developers and market participants to formulate their plans, strategies, and positions vis-à-vis the expanded and transformed marketplace arrangements. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.;"CSDs; Globalisation; Integration; Marketplace; Markets; Securities; Settlement; Technology";"Panourgias, N.S.; School of Management, University of LeicesterUnited Kingdom; email: np220@le.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Disasters such as Katrina (2005), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) Floods (2013), and Super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are examples that highlight the vulnerability of communities to natural hazards and the crippling effect they have on the social and economic well-being. Through foresight and scenario planning, such events can be expected but can they be predicted to support resilience and enable suppression of the impacts? With consideration of emerging and systemic risks and inherent uncertainty associated with surprising events, planning for and managing risk, crisis and disasters requires understanding of the outliers that challenge our resilience. 'Black Swans' represent the unpredictable. They represent ""... our misunderstanding of the likelihood of surprises"" (Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, 2007). A 'Black Swan' is described by Taleb (2007) as that which is an outlier, that which is outside the realm of regular expectations which carries with it an extreme impact such as natural disasters, market crashes, catastrophic failure of complex socio-technical systems and terrorist events such as 9/11. Sornette (Int J Terraspace Sci Eng 2(1):1-18, 2009) identifies a different class of extreme events (outliers) that he calls 'Dragon Kings'. Sornette (2009) argues that Dragon Kings may have properties that make them not only identifiable in real time but also predictable. The evolving science on complexity (and, more specifically, on complex networks) and on resilience suggest that modeling and simulation of such extreme events can assist in the predictability and the suppression of low probability extremely high consequence events such as natural hazards (flood, earthquake, wildfire, tsunami, extreme weather), cyber-attacks, and financial events. Furthermore, the science of complex networks is developing rapidly and has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of complexity, potentially leading to innovative methods for the prediction of emergent behavior on natural and technological networks, as well as specific strategies for designing networks that are more resistant (resilient) to both failure and attack. Governments and owners of critical physical and digital infrastructure may benefit from analyses, advice and exercises that involve predictable and suppressible ""Dragon-King"" type of low probability extremely high consequence extreme events, as well as from the utilization of recent advances in complex network theory, to ultimately enhance resiliency. This chapter contributes to the discourse on Dragon Kings arguing for continued and concerted efforts to explore this domain. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

With the rapid development of communication technologies and mobile devices, educational data have been generated at an unprecedented pace. The emerging highly flexible and scalable approaches to data processing and analysis allow us to extract new insights and meaningful information from educational data that can benefit students, teachers and the whole education ecosystem. This paper introduces some new opportunities for Big Data analytics to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of students' learning and maximise their knowledge retention. First, we propose to use supervised learning algorithms, i.e. classification or regression, to try to predict student academic performance and thereby give an an early feedback for the expected achievements, both, during the course and before the course selection process. Second, we propose to use these predictions to guide the modules, courses and content recommendation that maximizes students' potential reflected in their learning abilities, areas of interest, goals of education and career. Third, we propose to focus on the mechanics of the students' learning process and try to identify the optimal format, style, pace and organisation of the knowledge acquisition process that would lead to measurable improvements in the attained academic performance and knowledge retention in the long run. Finally, we take the introduced learning optimisation approaches together and try to formulate flexible delivery via personalization of the individual students' journeys through the educational curriculum that leave them satisfied with more knowledge delivered quicker and retained longer. © 2015 IEEE.;;;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;"9781479980581; 9781479980581";;;English;Int Conf Dig Signal Process DSP;2-s2.0-84961303714;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

First, we derive an eight-step scenario approach and add the identification of emerging technologies as well as their respective effects on each scenario. Second, we illustrate this combined method in the field of personalized medicine (PM). Existing literature on method combination often focuses singular challenges and benefits associated with the scenario technique. In this paper, however, we integrate the results of a bibliometric analysis at each step of the scenario technique. Herein, we refer mainly to the co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling network. Third, we describe the findings of our case study for every step of the application of the scenario technique. In doing so, we offer practical guidelines for applying this novel combined method in other contexts. The overall benefit of the method combination is the integration of scientifically based information that exceeds the knowledge bases of the scenario team and other experts. Most notably, the examination of vast amounts of technology-specific information facilitates the identification of emerging technologies. Moreover, the combined method allows for a more precise projection of future states when narrowing the scenario funnel. Using this eight-step scenario approach, we build three scenarios for the field of PM, discuss disruptive events, and identify and integrate emerging technologies into each scenario. Finally, we explore strategic decisions for various stakeholders in the PM field. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..;"Bibliometrics; Emerging technologies; Method combination; Personalized medicine; Scenario technique; Technology foresight";"Stelzer, B.; Institute of Technology and Process Management, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstraße 22, Germany";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The study gives science-based insights for a future integrated estuarine water management in the Yangtze (Changjiang) Estuary. The hindsight focuses on the evolution and fate of riverine dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in the Yangtze Estuary from 1999 to 2010. A significant correlation between phosphorus and suspended particulate matter (SPM) was established. This shows that, in the past decade, the estuary has changed from being a source of DIP to being a sink, and from a heterotrophic system to an autotrophic system. The ecosystem shift may be explained by the combined impact of the construction of dams that retain SPM but not nutrients, and to increasing nutrient fluxes to the estuary due to increasing usage of fertilizer and sewage. The foresight study is based on likely future scenarios for 2050. These are estimated using historical data and the stratified and a muddy-LOICZ model, which takes stratification and adsorption-desorption of phosphorus into account. We forecast that in 2050 the effective DIP inflow into the Yangtze Estuary will increase by a factor of 1.5 if the SPM remains at the current annual average of 700mgL-1, and by a factor of 3.3 if the SPM decreases to 200mgL-1 as a result of the dams, which will further degrade the estuary. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"Autotrophy; Dams; Heterotrophy; Phosphorus; Suspended particulate matter; Yangtze Estuary (Changjiang)";"Chen, Z.; State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal ResearchChina";Academic Press;2727714;;ECSSD;;English;Estuar.

This paper aims at describing the long-run outcomes emerging from possible alternative growth strategies, differentiated between CEECs and EU15 countries, that had historically grown on the basis of two different development strategies. The analysis involves the development of scenarios over a time span of 18. years, from 2012, the latest year with actual data, up to 2030. Results show that the effects of Eastern countries' development strategies are highly influenced by the strategies chosen by the Western ones, while the opposite does not hold. Moreover, a scenario in which both groups of countries increase the quality of their original strategies, but remain in their actual productive specialization trajectories, is the least expansionary. In all cases, a strategy of modernization of CEECs economies leads to a more expansionary scenario; this strategy pays the most for Eastern countries if Western countries also move towards an industrial strategy. Finally, the most expansionary scenario is one of an advanced industrial Europe, and interestingly enough, this is also associated to lower increases in regional disparities. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..";"Competitive strategies; Economic crisis; European regions; Globalization; Quantitative foresight; R11; R15; Regional growth";"Caragliu, A.; Politecnico di Milano, Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Italy";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Due to ongoing social change and the resulting changes in the requirements for democracy, the participative elements of democracy are constantly evolving. Consequently, in recent decades, the methods and instruments of public participation have developed and adapted to the changing demands in western democracies. Where, however, is public participation headed? This question remains unanswered, and the research at hand aims to answer it. To structure the current, at times controversial, discussion and gain insight into the future of public participation, we use a Delphi survey. Our survey focuses on expectations about the future of public participation using data from German administration professionals. The panelists evaluate 10 future projections on developments in public participation in Germany until the year 2020. Based on the obtained data, we identify the projections for which the panel agrees on the expected probability of occurrence. Moreover, we analyze the projections with dissent among the panelists in more detail and examine the evaluations for consensus within different subgroups. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.;"Delphi survey; E-participation; Futures studies; Public participation; Social change; Strategic foresight";"Vogt, S.; University of Giessen Germany, Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurship, Licher Str. 62, Germany";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

While the Delphi method has been a widely accepted foresight technique, prediction markets have been a very recent innovation to the existing decision and foresight support systems. Though, traditional prediction markets have been quite successful recently, our extension to the traditional prediction market methodology allows us to extract more valuable market information than any other prediction market since our approach provides not only a market forecast but also delivers an entire forecast distribution. The forecast distribution is generated by the aggregation of another unique characteristic of the suggested market structure namely that financial market professionals have to submit an interval forecast rather than point forecast. Based on our analysis, we demonstrate that our market is weak-form efficient and hence contains all publicly available information. In terms of forecasting accuracy, we conclude that the precision of our market improved over time and overall outperformed its benchmark. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Decision and foresight support system; Delphi method; Forecasting; Information integration; Prediction market";"Prokesch, T.; EBS Business School, Gustav-Stresemann-Ring 3, Germany";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Currently, specialized IT systems can support various strategic foresight methods and foresight activities, but these are generally focused on isolated applications rather than providing a holistic solution.This article contributes to the field of foresight support systems by documenting and demonstrating the development and implementation of a foresight support system tailored for the German Federal Armed Forces. We draw on a literature-based design for foresight support systems and demonstrate how our system addresses issues raised in the literature.

There is a growing interest in the design, accessibility, application and development of ICT-based systems for foresight processes by foresight practitioners and researchers alike. The foresight discipline applies more than 30 different techniques to obtain valid and profound conclusions about future developments and scenarios. Until now, only a fewof these techniques have been transferred into reliable software applications. However, this situation is changing quickly and many prototypes and ICT applications are being developed throughout theworld.Moreover, there has been a recent trend to develop even more complex software suites that embed and interlink multiple techniques. In order to respond to the dynamic progress in the field, we introduce this Special Issue on the future role of ICT in foresight.We selected nine informative articles that present the most recent research on foresight support systems, which form the basis for ongoing scientific debate in this new research stream. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;;"von der Gracht, H.A.; Friedrich-Alexander-University (FAU) Erlangen-Nuremberg, Lange Gasse 20, Germany";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

We argue that engaging in foresight (1) enables clusters and organizations to face discontinuous change, (2) avoids lock-in of business clusters by networking and knowledge exploitation and that (3) collaborative foresight can support such networking. As systemic instruments that connect stakeholders and support continuous foresight processes, FSSs are especially suited to achieve these results. We present five basic premises to conceptualize an FSS and concretize them by a requirement analysis for an FSS funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the course of Germany's Leading-Edge Cluster Logistics. The requirements lead to the conceptualization of a foresight database, a digital future workshop application, and a prediction market application integrated in a futures platform. All applications are interlinked to support users through a guided, web-based, multi-method foresight process. The implementation of the FSS in business clusters and insights acquired during the three-year project are discussed. Overall, we present insights on how regionally implemented foresight contributes to regional innovation systems and thereby contribute to the emerging research stream on FSS. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Cluster; Foresight support systems; Information technology; Prediction market; Regional innovation; Trend database";"Keller, J.; EBS Universitaet fuer Wirtschaft und Recht, EBS Business School, Konrad-Adenauer-Ring 15, Germany";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Two categories of measures were used to compare results between cases; participation characteristics, such as the number and type of participants involved, and interaction characteristics, such as the number of variables and opinions incorporated, the mechanisms of analysis, etc. The systems studied were found to have substantial impact on the early stages of the scenario process, in particular: increased participation in terms of both amount and diversity, increased volume and speed of data collected and analyzed, increased transparency around driver selection and analysis, and decreased overall cost of project administration. These results are discussed in the context of emerging issues and opportunities for scenario planning, particularly for public scenario projects, and how such tools and platforms might change scenario practice over time. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.";"Crowdsourcing; Online participation; Public policy; Scenario planning; Strategic foresight";"Raford, N.; Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London, Gower Street, United Kingdom";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The simulation has been run for the first case study of Mobile Stroke Units (MSUs). In the highly time sensitive setting of acute stroke, MSUs are an innovative approach as they aim to reduce 'time-to-thrombolysis'.The ProHTA approach focuses on interdisciplinary work related to forecasting with hybrid simulation consisting of system dynamics models for macro-simulation and agent-based models for micro-simulation.Results of the simulation show that MSUs save up to 49. min of time between ambulance call and therapy decision. Whereas without MSUs, only 0.2% of patients fall in the group with the most favourable time interval between 0 and 90. min, up to 16.6% of patients treated in MSUs fall into this group of early onset times to thrombolysis. As a flexible and primarily quantitative decision-making tool for foresight, ProHTA adds value to existing methodologies for pre-assessing health technology at a very early stage of technology research and development. With its emphasis on strategic planning, ProHTA helps to improve the efficiency of health care delivery in different settings using hybrid simulation techniques. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.";"Early technology assessment; Foresight; Health care; Medical device; Simulation; Stroke";"Kolominsky-Rabas, P.L.; Interdisciplinary Centre for Health Technology Assessment and Public Health, University of Erlangen-NurembergGermany";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In this research, we apply Scenario Analysis in order to identify the barriers affecting the decision to invest in the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) sector in Morocco. Our results aim at facilitating the process of defining different paths in strategic political and policy actions. Using data from a survey on a panel of experts, the Cross Impact Analysis (CIA) and the Cross Impact Matrix System (SMIC) techniques are applied. The advantage of these techniques is that they allow including in the analysis the interlinkages between the events that will define the future scenarios. However, their limitation is that the number of events analyzed cannot be too high since the information collected from the experts increases exponentially according to the number of events introduced. We thus expand our analysis with a new methodological approach, combining the use of prospective and statistics techniques. This approach allows addressing the mentioned limitation and applying these techniques, initially restricted to 6 events in its common application, to a large number of events. The results show that uncertainty and informality would be key factors in promoting the arrival of companies in this sector. Additionally, regarding companies that already have a presence in Morocco's renewable energy sector, an increase in activity would be achieved through improvements in the easing of financial and legal barriers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"Cross Impact Analysis (CIA); CSP sector; Foreign investment barriers; Renewable energy; Scenarios design; SMIC technique";"Medina, E.; Department of Applied Economics, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Ciudad Universitaria de CantoblancoSpain";Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-84936996979;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite their popularity in IT for Foresight, a major obstacle is the complexity of strategic decisions and the resulting multitude of scenarios. Therefore choices need to be made, which scenarios to fully work out, by which experts and in which level of detail. This paper presents an approach to support making these trade-offs between accuracy and resources spent by prioritising scenarios based on their significance for the decision even on the basis of incomplete information. This approach combines theoretical findings in decision theory with results that were elicited in interviews and workshops with decision-makers and experts. In this manner, we ensure to adhere to time and effort constraints of the involved experts, while taking into account the decision-makers' preferences and requirements. The emergency management use-case shows that the resulting reduced set of scenarios leads to the same ranking of decision alternatives as the entire set of scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Complexity; Distributed scenario construction; Emergency management; Scenario prioritisation; Scenario relevance; Scenario similarity; Strategic decision making";"Comes, T.; Centre for Integrated Emergency Management, University of AgderNorway";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Policy makers and industrial communities use roadmapping methods to predict future industrial growth, but the existing bibliometric/workshop methods have limitations when analyzing the full-lifecycle industrial emergence, including the transitions between science, technology, application, and the mass market. This paper, therefore, proposes a framework that integrates bibliometrics and a technology roadmapping (TRM) workshop approach to strategize and plan the future development of the new, technology-based industry. The dye-sensitized solar cell technology-based industry in China is selected as a case study. In this case, the bibliometrics method is applied to analyze the existing position of science and technology, and TRM workshops are used to strategize the future development from technology to application and marketing. Key events and impact on the development of the new, technology-based industry have been identified. This paper will contribute to the roadmapping and foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic industry researchers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Bibliometrics; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Emerging industry; PV industry; Technology roadmap";"Zhou, Y.; School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua UniversityChina";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Biomass energy in Turkey is one of the most important renewable energy sources in terms of energy potential. Traditional biomass (wood and dung) in Turkey has a significant energy production rate. This ratio has been decreased with the decline of forests and the reduction seen in animal husbandry, recently. Traditional biomass is usually used in the form of non-commercial fuel and meets a quarter of the domestic energy production. Traditional biomass energy production has been planned 7530 Btep in 2020. In Turkey, the use of modern biomass energy is important in terms of the country's economy, and the environment pollution. Turkey has the potential to provide an alternative source of energy from the most appropriate and most cost-effective agricultural products according to its ecological conditions. Modern biomass started with 17 Btep in 2000. However, there has not been the foresight to future production. Whereas traditional biomass energy production should increasingly be reduced and modern biomass energy production should be increased. This situation will offer new investment fields to investors. This study shows that biomass energy continues to be the main source of energy for climate change mitigation and energy sustainability in Turkey, particularly in its traditional forms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the presence of demand learning, the firm needs to make a decision, whether to actively learn the market through a greater initial investment in the AFS network or defer the commitment since an overly-aggressive investment often results in sub-optimal AFS locations. To illustrate this trade-off, we introduce a two-stage location model, in which the service provider enters the market by deploying a set of stations in the first stage under uncertainty, and has the option to add more stations in the second stage after it learns the demand. The demand learning time (length of the first stage) is endogenously determined by the service provider’s action in the first stage. To solve this problem, we develop an efficient solution method that provides a framework to achieve a desired error rate of accuracy in the optimal solution. Using numerical experiment, we study the trade-off between active learning and deferred commitment in AFS deployment strategy under different market characteristics. Further, we find that the lack of planning foresight typically results in an over-commitment in facility investment while the service provider earns a lower expected profit. © 2014, US Government.;"Alternative fuel station operations; Demand learning; Facility location; Maximal covering problem";"Lim, M.K.; Department of Business Administration, University of IllinoisUnited States";Kluwer Academic Publishers;2545330;;;;English;Ann.

We contribute to this discussion by examining foresight through the lens of established theory building literature to map what constitutes a theory in the first place and how it applies in foresight. The main guiding question is ""What does a theory of foresight mean?"". We fist draw on the literature on theory development in social sciences to discuss a framework for theorizing and then examine the scope of theorizing through it. Our main argument is that when we propose developing (a) theory of foresight, we need to separate three levels of analysis: one is foresight as knowledge creating activity, second is foresight as a process and as a social/organizational intervention, and foresight as theorizing about the future of a given socio-technical system. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.";"Epistemology; Foresight; Theorizing; Theory development";"Piirainen, K.A.; Technical University of Denmark - DTU, DTU Management Engineering, Technology and Innovation Management, Produktionstorvet, Building 426, Denmark; email: kalpii@dtu.dk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

After the crisis of late 1990s, the government declared science and technology (S&T) as one of national priorities and started increasingly investing in this sector but it has not led to the tangible output like a bigger volume of high-tech exports or a higher share of international publications. A number of policy instruments have been introduced to increase the efficiency of STI policies. One of them is S&T Foresight. The activities aimed at identification of national S&T priorities and series of Foresight studies have helped to understand which areas are most promising for sustaining existing competitive advantages and building new ones via gradual shift from the resource-based economy towards the technology-oriented one. The paper presents the design and organisation of a large-scale Russian S&T Foresight exercise as a fully-fledged instrument of the national STI policy and discusses the achieved results and their use for policies at different levels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd;"Foresight methodology; Priority research areas; Science and technology Foresight; Science, technology and innovation policy";"Sokolov, A.; Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge, National Research University Higher School of Economics, Myasnitskaya str., 20, Russian Federation; email: sokolov@hse.ru";Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-84963576474;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Water safety testing for pathogens currently depends on surrogate measures such as fecal indicator bacteria (e.g., E. coli). Metagenomics concerns high-throughput, culture-independent, unbiased shotgun sequencing of DNA from environmental samples that might transform water safety by detecting waterborne pathogens directly instead of their surrogates. Yet emerging innovations such as metagenomics are often fiercely contested. Innovations are subject to shaping/construction not only by technology but also social systems/values in which they are embedded, such as experts' attitudes towards new scientific evidence. We conducted a classic three-round Delphi survey, comprised of 107 questions. A multidisciplinary expert panel (n = 24) representing the continuum of discovery scientists and policymakers evaluated the emergence of metagenomics tests. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first Delphi foresight study of experts' attitudes on (1) the top 10 priority evidentiary criteria for adoption of metagenomics tests for water safety, (2) the specific issues critical to governance of metagenomics innovation trajectory where there is consensus or dissensus among experts, (3) the anticipated time lapse from discovery to practice of metagenomics tests, and (4) the role and timing of public engagement in development of metagenomics tests. The ability of a test to distinguish between harmful and benign waterborne organisms, analytical/clinical sensitivity, and reproducibility were the top three evidentiary criteria for adoption of metagenomics. Experts agree that metagenomic testing will provide novel information but there is dissensus on whether metagenomics will replace the current water safety testing methods or impact the public health end points (e.g., reduction in boil water advisories). Interestingly, experts view the publics relevant in a ""downstream capacity"" for adoption of metagenomics rather than a co-productionist role at the ""upstream"" scientific design stage of metagenomics tests. In summary, these findings offer strategic foresight to govern metagenomics innovations symmetrically: by identifying areas where acceleration (e.g., consensus areas) and deceleration/reconsideration (e.g., dissensus areas) of the innovation trajectory might be warranted. Additionally, we show how scientific evidence is subject to potential social construction by experts' value systems and the need for greater upstream public engagement on metagenomics innovations. © 2015 Birko et al.";;;Public Library of Science;19326203;;POLNC;26066837;English;PLoS ONE;2-s2.0-84935462912;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Among nine experimental foresight workshops at the inaugural Emerge conference at Arizona State University, many focused on producing physical objects or media, one modeled and expanded upon a method pioneered by architect and polymath R. Buckminster Fuller. At a time when many of the capabilities to realize Fuller's specifications for big data have matured, I investigate whether comprehensive design as framed by Fuller's method shows promise as a trend enabling ecologically sustainable innovations.

However, often these studies overlook the soft factor of employee competences which is critical to adopting technological and organizational changes and to developing the necessary innovation capabilities. This study investigates the theoretical and methodological underdeveloped relationship between technological innovation and social initiated change and the impact on individual competences in a dynamic sector. The setting of our study is the turbulent creative industries as a whole, where creative and artistic expression merges with changing technological progress. In a scenario study we mainly conducted in 2010, we developed a scenario model for competences to combine individual competences with a scenario approach to investigate how competences are important to the sector shift or need to be enhanced in the future. We use primary qualitative data from expert interviews and workshops and secondary data from industry reports to identify thirty-seven influence factors. An influence matrix calculation and a cluster analysis are used to project three different scenarios presenting how future developments of the creative industries will influence the competences needed for creative occupations. Now, five years later, we reflect the accuracy of the developed scenarios via a comparison of today's situation with the situation in the scenarios. We discuss theoretical contributions for the foresight literature and practical implementations for the future of work in general, and in particular for the creative industries case. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.;"Competences; Convergence; Creative economy; Creative industries; Digital; Entertainment; Foresight; Futures studies; Human capital resource; Media; Microfoundations; Scenario; Skills; Strategic human resources; Technological impact; Work";"Kamprath, M.; Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau, Hochschulring 1, Germany; email: Martin.Kamprath@ime.uni-potsdam.de";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

These dynamics have a direct influence and will trigger off service innovation. Firstly, the drivers of the service economy are presented, many of them fostering service innovation as a way to face new societal and business challenges. Secondly, emerging developments are discussed to identify the most promising service innovation dynamics. Finally, foresight scenarios demonstrate possible future trends of the new service economy. These scenarios are based on a methodology developed and applied in the context of an EC-funded project on Sectoral Innovation Systems. This exercise is performed for the overall set of services activities although a particular focus is given on activities such as knowledge intensive business services and distributive trade services. Results indicate that emerging developments are those related to the reconciliation between industrialisation and customisation associated with ICT, ageing population, sustainable development and service regression and extension dynamics. The cases of knowledge intensive services and distributive trades have shown how different drivers and emerging developments are interrelated and establish different scenarios for future development. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Europe; Foresight; Future; Knowledge-intensive services; Services; Wholesale and retail trade";"Gallouj, F.; Faculty of Economics and Sociology, University Lille 1, Cité scientifiqueFrance";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The conventional net present value (NPV) presents a static picture that does not account for the value of waiting for better market conditions to proceed with a DG investment. On the contrary, real options (RO) analysis does account for the managerial flexibility to switch between options over the investment horizon. In this paper we argue that the value of a DG wind-based project can be revisited by means of Longstaff-Schwartz method, originally intended for the evaluation of American financial options. The adaption of this method to the wind power DG setting provides a means for (i) efficiently dealing with the several stochastic processes involved (spot electricity prices and possibly various wind speed processes) avoiding the curse of dimensionality, (ii) accounting for the decaying capital cost of DG, and (iii) solving the perfect foresight problem presented by Monte Carlo conventional simulations. We present in this paper the procedure to follow when applying the method to the wind power DG setting. Particularly, we discuss the standardization of the wind speed and spot price processes, and the advantages of building a state space model that includes all the correlated processes by adequately transforming Box-Jenkins and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Also we discuss the representation of the capital cost forecast by means of learning curves. On the whole, we put together this multivariate setting and show how it is translated to the Longstaff-Schwartz framework. The developed methodological approach allows us analyzing the sensitivity of the RO value to the site and DG capacity factor, the risk-free rate, the current forward projections of global installed capacity, and the aggregation of DGs under a common owner. On the whole, we conclude that the RO analysis is best employed to analyze DG settings in which the NPV yields a close to negative assessment: low power production, for instance. In such cases, RO analysis shows advantages in producing delayed optimal investment times. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"Learning curve; Real options; Stochastic processes; Wind energy conversion";"Díaz, G.; Dep. of Electrical Engineering, University of Oviedo, Campus de Viesques, s/n, Spain; email: guzman@uniovi.es";Elsevier Ltd;3062619;;APEND;;English;Appl.

Prior studies typically use the midpoint to evaluate analyst reaction to range forecasts, implicitly assuming that analysts place equal weights on the upper and the lower bounds of management range forecasts. We empirically test this restrictive assumption and provide strong evidence of unequal weights - analysts place significantly more (less) weight on the lower (upper) bound of forecast ranges. Moreover, such overweight on the lower bound is more pronounced when analysts face higher ambiguity, consistent with the ""max-min"" axiom, which predicts that decision-makers tend to assign higher probability to the worst-case scenario when facing ambiguity.

To achieve such efficiency, a multitude of technological and process-related approaches are currently being developed. The aim of this paper is to utilize technology foresight to identify the technologies and processes, which might be relevant for sustainable production in the German automotive industry in the future. Therefore, we conducted a Delphi survey with practitioners and practice-oriented researchers concerning future technologies and their postulated effect on sustainability goals in the automotive industry. The assessments were grouped into five categories: short-term developments, uncertain short-term to mid-term developments, (certain) short-term to mid-term developments, mid-term developments, and long-term developments. These categories provide insight regarding potential drivers (cost reduction, customer demands, and legal requirements) and hindrances (costs associated with large investments) for the implementation of various technologies. Major automotive suppliers are expected to adopt new sustainable technologies faster than small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) since they have the financial means to make investments and sufficient production volumes for automation, and modify production arrangements more often. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Automotive; Sustainable production; Technology Delphi; Technology foresight";"Förster, B.; University of Paderborn, Chair of International Business, Warburger Straße 100, Germany";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In order to reach this goal, the following intellectual traditions are introduced to review the philosophical and historical contexts that affect the very foundations of futures studies: (a) religions, (b) utopias, (c) historicism, (d) science fiction, and (e) systems thinking. The first phase (beginning in 1945 to the 1960s) was the era of scientific inquiry and rationalization of the futures characterized by the prevalence of technological forecasting, the rise of alternative futures in systematic ways, and the growth of professionalization of futures studies. In the first phase, futures had become objects of rationalization removed from the traditional approaches such as utopia, grandiose evolutionary ideas, naive prophecies, science fiction, religious attitudes, and mystical orientation. The second phase (the 1970s and the 1980s) saw the creation the global institution and industrialization of the futures. This era was marked by the rise of worldwide discourse on global futures, the development of normative futures, and the deep involvement of the business community in futures thinking. In the second phase, futures studies-industry ties were growing and the future-oriented thoughts extensively permeated the business decision-making process. The third phase (the 1990s - the present) reflects the current era of the neoliberal view and fragmentation of the futures. This phase is taking place in the time of neoliberal globalization and risk society discourses and is characterized by the dominance of foresight, the advance of critical futures studies, and the intensification of fragmentation. In the third phase, futures practice tends to be confined to the support of strategic planning, and hence is experiencing an identity crisis and loss of its earlier status of humanity-oriented futures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"Fragmentation of futures; History of western futures studies; Industrialization of futures; Intellectual tradition; Periodization; Rationalization of futures";"Son, H.; Chonbuk National University, 567 Baekje-daero, South Korea";Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-84922466393;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And yet is it the purpose of foresight studies to provide highly detailed analyses and to predict or produce the future in a precise way? Surely not, says Georges Amar, or at least not exclusively. As he suggests in this article, the important thing today in the foresight field is ""rather, to open up the future, to give it some air, some room for manoeuvre."" That is why Amar argues here for a non-predictive form of foresight, more focussed on the paradigm shifts that are likely to happen and on the possibilities opened up by the emerging paradigms. In support of his argument, Georges Amar draws on the paradigm shifts underway in the transport world (the emergence of the ""transmodal"", ""mobile life"" etc.) and their socio-economic effects (in terms of usage, and tools and resources, but also on the actors in the sector). Understood in this way, this foresight approach, which he describes as ""conceptive"", enables new cognitive resources to be identified, offering a fertile, open future both for the actors of today and for future generations.";;Amar, G.;Futuribles;0337307X;;;;French;Futuribles Anal.

However, informing the public about what the future holds based on the development of S&T is an equally important role of TF. Since the introduction of the first TF in 1994, Korea has conducted four such studies. TF in Korea has become a key process in setting S&T policy, such as the Science and Technology Basic Plan (S&T Basic Plan). The S&T Basic Plan determines the national strategic technologies by ref lecting on future technology. The S&T Basic Plan is a mandatory legal planning process established every five years by the Korean government. It is the top-level policy document affecting S&T-related policy making in Korea. TF in Korea primarily utilizes the Delphi method. The third and fourth TFs have strengthened the links between S&T and society by determining future technologies capable of solving future needs. The fourth TF presented scenarios and special illustrations to show members of the public the future technologies and their implications for society. Additionally, the fourth round of TF analyzed the potential negative impacts of future technologies.;"Delphi method; S&T strategies; Science and technology (S&T) policy; Technology assessment; Technology Foresight";;;23129972;;;;English;Foresight STI Gov.;2-s2.0-84988273440;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The dashboard uses advanced analytics to assess programme applications and programme inquiries to assess whether the programme is being used properly. Via an integrated intelligence process, it monitors the external environment to ensure that programme assumptions in terms of what technologies are most appropriate remain valid.

The country's plans to further research and innovation in the sector impact the world energy outlook. The paper examines the energy block of the Russian SandT Foresight 2030, developed by experts in 2011-2013 and approved by the Prime minister in January 2014. The official document, which covers six areas, including 'Energy efficiency and energy saving', defines the key science and technology (SandT) areas Russia has to embark upon in order to boost its competitiveness. The energy part of the study covers global challenges, threats, and opportunities for Russia, prospective innovative markets for its products and services. Moreover, Russia's innovative technologies and products are assessed, including the potential demand and competition aspects and benchmarking against global leaders. The paper features major outcomes of the energy block and puts the exercise in a comparative perspective with similar international studies of Kazakhstan, Germany, Canada, the UK, USA and international organizations. The author concludes that in Russia energy efficiency and energy saving priorities dominate the policy agenda, with relatively little attention to advancing renewable energy technologies. The Foresight horizon is also markedly shorter than that of similar studies in the OECD countries. Following international practice, in 2015 Russia plans to perform a new government-led SandT Foresight for the energy sector alone. © 2015 The Authors.

Edgeman R.;Strategic resistance for sustaining enterprise relevance: A paradigm for sustainable enterprise excellence, resilience and robustness;2015;International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management;10.1108/IJPPM-10-2014-0155;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923335370&doi=10.1108%2fIJPPM-10-2014-0155&partnerID=40&md5=dd1a40f790c7ca41d3a888f038c6f1b4;Business and Technology Department & Interdisciplinary Center for Organizational Architecture, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark;Edgeman, R., Business and Technology Department & Interdisciplinary Center for Organizational Architecture, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark;;;Purpose – Enterprise sustainability is the capacity to create and maintain social, economic, and environmental benefits. While sustainability connotes survival, excellence is the capacity to thrive across critical performance domains. Enter resilience and robustness. Resilience is enterprise ability to self-renew through innovation, changing and reinventing itself by adapting its responses to political, social, economic and other competitive shocks or challenges. Robustness is enterprise resistance or immunity gained through strategies, policies, partnerships, and practices that maintain or advance competitive position when shocks or challenges arise. Resistance as herein constructed is a composition or blend of revival, striving, surviving and thriving. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – A sustainable enterprise excellence, resilience and robustness (SEER2) model and assessment regime is proposed. SEER2 integrates excellence and sustainability principles, methodologies, and standards to optimize enterprise performance across the triple bottom line people, planet, and profit domains. Findings – A Springboard to SEER2 model blending simplicity, applicability, and usability by a range of enterprises is introduced. Its enablers include data analytics and intelligence, human ecology, and social-ecological innovation. Springboard technology includes an assessment regime that yields actionable feedback and foresight. These inform next generation strategy, activities and performance that support identification and implementation of best and next best practices and sources of competitive advantage. Practical implications – The Springboard to SEER2 enterprise self-assessment approach restricts itself to sustainability, excellence, resilience and robustness considerations. Originality/value – A model integrating SEER2 in relation to strategic resistance is introduced. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Business excellence; Business performance; Innovation; Modelling; Self-assessment; Sustainability";"Edgeman, R.; Business and Technology Department & Interdisciplinary Center for Organizational Architecture, Aarhus UniversityDenmark";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;17410401;;;;English;Int.

Traditionally, foresight activities involves Delphi, focus group, or Estimate–Talk–Estimate techniques to collect opinions of an expert panel. Often, these techniques are not computerized and data visualization is rudimentary. Our highly-interactive FSS solves a number of inherent issues during the data collection, analysis, and results visualization processes. Despite that MCDM methods have been recommended for technology foresight, a validation with a real field experiment was still required. To evaluate our approach and FSS, we conducted a foresight exercise for the Swiss mobile payments market. Our research confirms that the use of MCDM methods supported with a computerized tool can enhance the foresight processes and results. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;"Foresight support systems; MCDM methods; Technology foresight";"Ondrus, J.; ESSEC Business SchoolFrance";Kluwer Academic Publishers;9262644;;;;English;Group Decis.

Foresight technology is the most appropriate one. The purpose of this article is to give a brief description of the foresight as a technology of foreseeing and identifying the most promising points of regional capacity, aimed at improving the competitiveness on the example of a particular region of the Russian Federation - the Republic of Adygea. The authors note that conducting the regional foresight project must be preceded by an analysis of economic, natural, innovative, and information-technological capacity of the region. The article reviews the methods for foresight, gives the characteristics of natural, economic, innovation and information-technological capacity of the Republic of Adygea. In the article the development problems of the region, uncertainty factors and trends of socio-economic changes in the republic have been identified. The implementation of the foresight project will allow to form the basis for social partnership of government, business and social community in order to better exploit opportunities and the implementation of the economic capacity of the region. © 2015, Econjournals.

In other words, participants create knowledge about the future. Interaction between the participants is a key ingredient of foresight, yet this dynamic interaction has rarely been studied from the perspective of knowledge creation. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by looking at how, and through what kinds of dynamics, knowledge is created in a foresight workshop; how it is manifested; and what are the special characteristics of futures knowledge. We develop a typology of knowledge in foresight workshops, and construct an exploratory methodological approach for analysing the knowledge creation dynamics in transcribed workshop discussions. Based on the results from the analysis of two workshop discussions, we argue that futures knowledge is founded on the knowledge base formed by the participants and new knowledge is created both through cumulative discussion flow and revelatory statements which reframe the discussion or challenge implicit assumptions. We argue that the typology of knowledge as well as the exploratory method aid in understanding futures expertise and support the planning of foresight processes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.";"Foresight; Foresight process; Futures knowledge; Knowledge creation; Knowledge typology; Workshop";"Dufva, M.; VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Tekniikankatu 1, Tampere, P.O.

Weak signals, also conceptualised as trends, can be considered the most relevant input for developing foresight in an organisation. While detecting weak signals has traditionally relied on the news media, cultural products such as literature, movies, art, or computer games appear to have been neglected in the practice of foresight.However, literary genres such as novels can be a valuable source for developing foresight. Literature can be characterised as delivering ""thick descriptions"". Not only do novels describe social practices, but from them the reader also gains, for instance, deep insights into the feelings and emotions of the characters.These thick descriptions are even more interesting in the context of foresight when one considers that these descriptions play a role in the construction of social reality and therefore can influence, over time, reality, or rather translate fiction into fact. It can be argued that the new departs from cultural products, before translating into widely accepted social practices or mass-market products. The value of using literature in foresight also appears to be related to the notion that these narratives can be read as scenarios, revealing the potential of literature. Because of their narrative structure, these scenarios can overcome cognitive barriers in the development of foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.";"Cultural products; Foresight; Narratives; Trends";"Schwarz, J.O.; Aarhus University, Business and Social Sciences, Department of Business Administration, Bartolins Allé 10, Denmark";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a reconstruction of the guiding ideas that have been used for designing the social foresight course. Findings – As far as anticipation is concerned, the authors’ understanding of anticipation is still cursory, and the novelty of the perspective may conceal the difficulty implied by this otherwise refreshingly new vision. The theory is at such an early phase of development that it still lacks a unified conceptual language for theorizing and operationalizing anticipation to facilitate cross-disciplinary conversations. Originality/value – The ability to anticipate in complex environments may improve the resilience of societies under threat from a global proliferation of agents and forces by articulating insecurities through anticipatory processes.

Based on the word phren, phronesis means 'thought, 'intellectual perception, 'sense, 'prudence, 'practical wisdom, while prudentia is derived from prouidentia, meaning 'ability to look ahead, 'forecast, 'foresight and also 'Providence. Why, although their etymological roots were apparently different, did the Romans choose the word prudentia in order to translate Greek phronesis And how did such a translation alter the evolution of the philosophical concept of prudence in Latin culture It seems that Cicero offers a new analysis of prudentia by dividing the term prouidentia, from which it was formed, into two parts. The prefix pro- alludes not only to Aristotelian phronesis (a virtue especially related to the future and most important in political field), but also to Stoic pro-noia (or Pro-vidence) on a cosmological level, while the Latin verb videre ('to see) leads Ciceronian prudence, in ethics, towards a theoretical, i.e. contemplative, wisdom (sophia), inspired by Plato. © koninklijke Brill Nv, Leiden 2014.;"Cicero; Greek and Latin philosophy; phronêsis; prudence; prudentia";"Aubert-Baillot, S.; Université Stendhal-Grenoble 3, UFR LLASIC, 1180 avenue centrale, France";Brill Academic Publishers;267074;;;;French;Mnemosyne;2-s2.0-84923941972;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Results based on generalised impulse responses suggest that fiscal spending multipliers in recessions are greater than one, but not statistically larger than those in expansions.

In future, these developments could radically transform the oil, gas, and electricity markets. Therefore there is a greater need for improved forecasting methods that take into account the dynamics of market factors, primarily those related to the use of new technologies. We analyse the difficulties of forecasting demand for liquid fuels in conditions of uncertainty related to future technological developments in car transport. We classify the technologies driving demand for motor fuels by the nature of their impact on the demand for petroleum products: technologies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of traditional cars, as well as drivers of inter-fuel competition, both in terms of direct and indirect substitutes for petroleum products. To resolve the problem of limited input information, the methodology incorporates clustering instruments, which enable us to group countries according to certain criteria. The use of economic and mathematical tools with optimizing units enables us to make integrated calculations that model the market for liquid fuels and assess its interactions with the markets of other energy resources. Our proposed system for forecasting demand for liquid fuels, including petroleum products, can be used as an instrument to assess the future impact of technological innovation on the development of the oil industry when carrying out Foresight studies.;"Alternative fuel; Automotive transport; Energy efficiency; Forecast of demand; Oil products; Technology";;;23129972;;;;English;Foresight STI Gov.;2-s2.0-84953310163;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Risk management deals with the issue of uncertainty. In particular it aims to reduce uncertainty by envisioning possible scenarios and making forecasts on the basis of what it is considered probable within a range of possibilities. For this reason in order to properly adapt the risk management process to the field of architectural design it is necessary to understand the meaning and the relationship between: uncertainty, probability, range of possibilities and foresight. Moreover, it is also necessary to make clear the state of the art with reference to risk management process, as regards: terms, definitions, steps and methods. The risk management process has been defined many times and many different versions have been given over the last decades. In the current context the voluntary standards have unified terms, definitions, frameworks and steps of the process of risk management. The framework offered by the International Standards is particularly important in order to systematize knowledge from literature from various fields and to create a common ground to deal without either misunderstanding or ambiguity. Finally, applications of the risk management process in various context are reported and is introduced the possibility of using such approach in architectural design to control risks over building use and maintenance is introduced. * © The Author(s) 2015.;"Monte Carlo simulation; Probability; Risk; Risk assessment; Risk management; Uncertainty";;Springer Verlag;2191530X;;;;English;SpringerBriefs Appl.

Despite this fact, managerial fixation on short term performance objectives, their penchant fear of the unpredictable future and their sheer inability to face the alternative futures generated in the scenario planning exercises has led to little value capture from this activity. The paper analyzes the factors that determine the willingness of decision-makers, to be actively involved in scenario planning. The authors suggest that effective incentives to promote the interest in this activity and its impact can be found, if we consider the decision-makers, as 'consumers' of certain ideas, concepts, expectations, and competencies. In particular, the paper hypothesizes and validates the assumptions that the selection of appropriate targets for scenario planning, commitment to achieving them, expectations of positive outcomes, increasing the frequency of scenario planning exercises are more likely to be expressed in the growing interest of managers and stakeholders to develop scenarios. The presented results are tested on the most common - intuitive logic approach to scenario planning. The authors expect future research to go further to empirically test the proposed hypotheses, and if possible, ascertain whether similar hypotheses could be generated in the context of other tried and tested scenario planning methodologies such as the probabilistic modified trends, competitive intelligence and cross impact analysis.;"Conceptual consumption; Intuitive logics methodology; Scenario planning; Strategic foresight";;;23129972;;;;English;Foresight STI Gov.;2-s2.0-84953320726;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The proposed methodological approach and the relevant selected results of the research carried out using neural networks and contextual matrices are presented. Contextual matrices were used for the graphical presentation of a strategic position of the critical materials surface engineering technologies. Critical technologies are such having best development prospects and/or key significance in industry. For the purpose of preparing forecasts and analyses, expert studies were carried out with the e-Delphix method using information technology. The probabilistic multivariant scenarios of future events concerning materials surface engineering were created based on the data acquired from experts according to the results of computer simulations made using artificial neural networks. The original data from the experts also served to perform further investigations into the importance of the new technologies, according to the new approach, and the correctness of such approach was verified by comparing the results of heuristic research with the results of classical materials science research for 35 diverse technology groups. The strategic positions of 140 critical materials surface engineering technologies were determined by acting in consistency with the new approach and using own software and custom conceptual matrices. Hidden expert knowledge was thus converted, using the analytical tools and quantitative methods dedicated to this task, into a publicly available open knowledge. The relevant technologies were described and characterized by harmonized criteria using roadmaps and technology information sheets. The new approach described in this chapter, supported with extended information technology, is suitable for direct applications in other areas of knowledge while maintaining economically reasonable costs. © Springer-Verlag London 2015.

We show how some of the technologies highlighted may impact future space programmes, in particular novel ideas to enable future long-life large telescopes to be deployed. The study's final report was presented to ESA's High level Science Policy Advisory Committee (HISPAC) in late 2014. The goals of the study were to forecast the development of breakthrough technologies to enable novel space missions in the 2030-2050 timeframe, and to identify related partnerships through synergies with non-space specialists. It was not prepared to serve as a definitive guide for very specific technologies to be developed for future space missions, but to inform on and flag up the main developments in various technological and scientific areas outside space that may hold promise for use in the space domain. The report does this by identifying the current status of research for each domain, asserting the development horizon for each technology and providing some entry points, in the form of key European experts and institutions with knowledge of the domain. The identification of problems and solutions specific to the space area led us to focus the discussion around the concept of ""Overwhelming Drivers"" for space research and exploration, i.e. long-term goals that can be transposed into technological development goals. Two of these overwhelming drivers are directly relevant to ambitious future telescope projects, and we will show how some of the technologies we identified such as biomimetic structures, nanophotonics, novel materials and additive manufacturing could be combined to enable revolutionary new concepts for space telescopes. © 2015 SPIE.";;;SPIE;0277786X;"9781628417685; 9781628417685";PSISD;;English;Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng;2-s2.0-84951207108;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The producer plays an essential role in filmmaking, as they provide the funding required to turn out quality blockbusters for cinemagoers. Film production is a risky business, as illustrated by the examples of films that fail to cover costs every year. In this respect, tools capable of predicting movie profitability are of potential use to producers as a decision-making tool for deciding whether or not to produce a movie project. In this paper we report a study using historical data on over 100 films produced in the United States (including their genre, opening month, duration, budget, etc.). Decision trees were extracted from these data in order to forecast whether or not a film will be profitable even before it is produced. Decision trees are models commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence as decision support tools. The results show that the resulting model forecasts whether or not a movie will be profitable with an accuracy of over 70%, and this model can be used as a decision support tool for film producers. The proposed approach is not designed to be used as a standalone tool; it should rather round out other forecasting methods, including producers' foresight and judgement. The approach presented here could be equally applicable to other branches of the entertainment business, such as the music or video game industries.";"Data mining; Decision Support Systems; Decision trees; Movie industry; Movie profitability prediction";;Newswood Limited;20780958;9,79E+12;;;English;Lect.

The region's ability to effectively meet these challenges will require foresight, investment, and cooperation. As a contribution to this special issue, this paper presents one plausible 50-year scenario of the emergence of these challenges and the region's response to them. In it, early signs of economic, environmental, and governmental vulnerability are not adequately addressed. Investments aren't made to provide needed funding for monitoring and evaluation. The region's intellectual and environmental capital isn't leveraged, limiting the region's ability to address its economic and environmental challenges and compete with the rest of the world. The pursuit of local self-interest and short-term survival outweighs cooperation across jurisdictions and long-term planning. The vision of the future presented here is one in which the region's economy is dependent on stagnant extractive industries, its ecosystems are compromised, and its global standing is greatly reduced. In response to all of these developments, by 2063 hopelessness and violent tension is spreading throughout the region's population. © 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.;"Climate change; Divergence; Fracking; Green economy; Lake levels";"Kalafatis, S.E.; School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Michigan, 440 Church St., United States";International Association of Great Lakes Research;3801330;;JGLRD;;English;J.

Education, governance, personal attitudes and societal trends, rather than specific events, are drivers of a future which is perceived as being largely shaped by human choices. Innovation is believed to be more necessary in novel social arrangements than in further technology. The most feared futures arise from an amplification of trends already at play in the present: economic growth at the expense of the environment and quality of life, lack of equity, poor government, corporate greed, commercialism and erosion of social values. Economic and material growth does not feature in the most desired futures which are local, inclusive, peaceful, equitable and in some cases frugal.

Design/methodology/approach – Aspirational futures process, intuition-based visioning and “Type II” thinking that has high credibility for knowledgeable experts but low credibility to most others. Findings – Megacrisis is a Type II wild card needing anticipatory mitigation via strategies such as are suggested. While descent paths may be a suitable meme for technical professionals, ascent paths to higher levels of civilizational maturity are a better guiding image for the public. Aspirational methods whose core involves intuition-based creativity, wisdom and co-creative emergence are a vital complement to rational/ analytic futures methods, especially in times of epochal change and uncertainty when a new “regime” of guiding world views, institutional processes and innovative technologies may emerge. Research limitations/implications – Results represent a high degree of uncertainly as well as “fringe” thinking needing to be more widely considered. Practical implications – Strategic suggestions based on Type II thinking are a unique category for “leading edge” funding and application. Originality/value – The Type II perspective offered here is unique and offers a promising approach for transformative megacrisis mitigation. © Oliver Markley, 2015.;"Ascension; Aspirational; Descent paths; Ecological sustainabllity; Epochal change; Forecasting; Foresight; Intuition; Intuition; Scenario planning; Transformation; Type II wild cards";"Markley, O.; University of Houston-Clear Lake based at the Sasona CooperativeUnited States";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-84924350870;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We confront this question by developing an approach based on trends and networks of vital variables, analyzed by bibliometrics, which endeavours to detect fruitful trajectories of nanotechnology applied to ground-breaking anti-cancer treatments. Results tend to show two main technological waves of cancer treatments by nanotechnology applications. The early technological wave in the early 2000s was embodied in some types of chemotherapy agents with a broad spectrum of application, while after 2006 the second technological wave appeared with new applications of chemotherapy agents and molecular target therapy by nanotechnology. The present study shows new directions of nanotechnology-based chemotherapy and molecular cancer therapy in new treatments for breast, lung, brain and colon cancers. A main finding of this study is the recognition that, since the late 2000s, the sharp increase of several technological trajectories of anticancer drugs applied by nanotechnology seems to be driven by high rates of mortality of some types of cancers (e.g. pancreatic and brain) in order to find more effective anticancer therapies that increase the progression-free survival of patients: the so-called technological trajectories mortality driven. The study also points out that global research leaders tend to specialize in anticancer drugs, via nanotechnology, for specific cancers (e.g. Switzerland in prostate cancer, Japan in colon cancer, China in ovarian cancer and Greece in pancreatic cancer). These ground-breaking technological trajectories are paving new directions in biomedicine and generating a revolution in clinical practice that may lead to more effective anticancer treatments in the not-too-distant future. © 2014 Elsevier Inc..;"Bibliometrics; Biomedicine; Cancer; Chemotherapy; Mortality driven; Nanomedicine; Nanoscience; Nanotechnology; Publications; Radical innovation; Target therapy; Technological paradigm; Technological trajectories";"Coccia, M.; CNR-National Research Council of Italy, Via Real Collegio, n. 30, Italy; email: m.coccia@ceris.cnr.it";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

A review of the recent research in agriculture vehicle automatic guidance is presented in this paper, focusing on the position measurement, agriculture models and path tracking. And some forecasts are made on the trends of the agriculture vehicle automatic guidance. Generally, a modern agriculture vehicle automatic guidance system consists of 4 units: A detecting unit that measures the position and orientation of the vehicle; a control unit, as the core of the guidance system, which makes the plan of the path and carries out the path tracking; an executing unit that makes the turn of the wheels according to the command of the control unit; and a monitoring unit, or a field computer as it is called generally, which works as the interface between human and machine. There are 2 main problems to be solved in the agriculture vehicle guidance system. The first one is the measurement of the agriculture vehicle's working conditions, such as its position, heading, speed and wheel angle, among which the most important is the position measurement. There are 2 kinds of position measurement methods: One is the relative method, such as measuring the vehicle's position relative to a guidance baseline based on machine vision; the other is the absolute method, such as measuring the vehicle's absolute position on the earth based on the Global Navigation Satellite System. As the agriculture vehicle automatic guidance system is working in the field, the complicated and non-structured environment makes none of the measurement methods working well all the time. So the multi-sensor data fusion is brought into sharp focus by researchers. By combining measuring data from different sensors with some data fusing methods, such as Kalman filter, particle filter, H<inf>∞</inf> filter, and intelligent methods, the measurement accuracy is improved. The integrated navigation systems are mainly GPS/INS, GPS/DR and INS/CNS. The second problem is agriculture modeling and path tracking control methods. Most of the path tracking control algorithms use kinematics models. The two-wheel model is the most frequently used model, in which an agriculture vehicle is regarded as a two-wheel vehicle and its pose is described by its geographical coordinates, heading, wheel angle and speed. Dynamics models based on the Newton second law are another kind of model commonly used. As it takes into account of the change of the vehicle's dynamic characteristics with the external environment and the farm implements, it makes the control algorithms more robust. Besides the control methods based on models, researchers have developed some kind of algorithm without a model. The PID is the most useful control strategy. Another one is the pure pursuit method which simulates the driving behavior of human and has foresight. Nowadays, the agriculture vehicle automatic navigation technologies have widely used in the agriculture production, but many problems still need to be studied further. The advanced navigation technologies are worth studying, such as the headland turning control, obstacle detecting and active collision avoidance, and cooperative navigation by multi vehicles. And the agriculture vehicle internet of things is another interesting research area. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Planning and managing large-scale transitions in cities to deal with these pressures require an understanding of urban retrofitting at city scale. In this context performative techniques (such as backcasting and roadmapping) can provide valuable tools for helping cities develop a strategic view of the future. However, it is also important to identify 'disruptive' and 'sustaining' technologies which may contribute to city-based sustainability transitions. This paper presents research findings from the EPSRC Retrofit 2050 project, and explores the relationship between technology roadmaps and transition theory literature, highlighting the research gaps at urban/city level. The paper develops a research methodology to describe the development of three guiding visions for city-regional retrofit futures, and identifies key sustaining and disruptive technologies at city scale within these visions using foresight (horizon scanning) techniques. The implications of the research for city-based transition studies and related methodologies are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;"Cities; Energy; Low carbon; Retrofit; Roadmaps; Transition theory; Waste; Water";"Dixon, T.; School of Construction Management and Engineering, University of Reading, Engineering Building Whiteknights PO Box 205, United Kingdom; email: t.j.dixon@reading.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Even though this development is not new, appropriate approaches to address this social trend are unfortunately still lacking. Within the German Foresight Process I, the field of 'aging research' was identified as one of seven new future fields whose potential for national scientific research and innovation activities has not yet been quantified. However, so far, current progress in policy, science and industry seems in some respects largely unconnected or isolated. This paper provides an overview of these activities in the work environment context, conducing analyses covering the use of innovation policy measures, the topic discussions in scientific publications and the realizations in corporate contexts. The aim is to provide an integrated picture of the state of the different concepts in the field of 'active aging' in the different sub areas of a 'national' innovation and technology system in the case of Germany.1 © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Active aging; Aging workforces; Bibliometric analysis; Demographic change; European manufacturing survey; Innovation and technology policy; Science";"Bierwisch, A.; Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, Breslauer Straße 48, Germany";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Such analyses have typically been made under the assumption that future demographic developments are deterministic. When stochastic demographics have been considered, the problems have been simplified by assuming that the decision makers in the economic system behave as if they had perfect foresight as regards demographics. More realistically, we assume that the decision makers base their decisions on the forecasts of the future population, but revise their decisions when it turns out that the demographics do not follow the expected path. We contrast the nature of demographic uncertainty with that of financial markets, and argue that it is not realistic to assume that the revisions will occur according to the full rational expectations paradigm. Instead, the decision makers are assumed to revise according to the most recent point forecast. To implement this approach, we tailor standard nonparametric regression techniques to the task of computing the required future conditional expectations. Specifically, we assume that an approximation to the predictive distribution of the future population is available in terms of simulated population counts. The required conditional expectations are then obtained by averaging the future evolution of a set of sample paths that come from the neighborhood of a target path. This is formally equivalent to n-nearest neighbor kernel regression. The degree of smoothing can be chosen via cross-validation. An illustration based on a stochastic forecast of the population of Finland is given. © 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.;"Conditional expectation; Forecast update; Population forecast; Rational expectations; Uncertainty";"Alho, J.M.; University of HelsinkiFinland";Elsevier;1692070;;IJFOE;;English;Int.

The development of a “Global Change Data Base” (GCDB) promises a graphically and geographically oriented tool for the representation of correlations for global long-term data series. Design/methodology/approach – A literature analysis supports the interpretation of such “pattern recognitions”, especially the literature in the areas of economic growth, systems analysis, energy economics, social indicators and quality of life. Preconditions for economic growth are empirically analysed on a sectoral level along with prevailing structural shifts in the use of energy sources. Findings – The main outcome is a distillate of a few formative “paths of development”, according to a synthesis of to-date growth theories. These lines might influence development in future decades and co-determine the degree to which sustainability targets are met. Debates and discussion procedures make use of such findings and outline modes of actions. Practical implications – Developmental university curricula such as “Global Studies”, democratisation endeavours based on analyses of economic performance of (partly) democratic systems or global governance of science could profit from a consensus on global trends patterns, similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change endeavour at the United Nations level. Social implications – Such heuristic methods could suitably mediate (in “multicultural” manner) between contradictory paradigms of global economic development that are mainly ideology-driven and hamper global society’s joint action. Originality/value – In short, this is an empirical work on pattern recognition in global evolution using aggregated spatially and temporally enabled data. It refers to the historic example of Kon-Tiki which undertook a surprisingly long journey based on precise knowledge of ocean currents and wind without applying own force. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Energy; Forecast; Foresight; Forward looking; Futurology; Global change; Global Change Data Base; Global governance; Global Studies; Kon-Tiki; Long-term trends; Socio-economy";"Ahamer, G.; Interfaculty Department of Geoinformatics, Paris Lodron UniversityAustria; email: gilbert.ahamer@sbg.ac.at";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;2053535X;;;;English;J.

To overcome this biased perception, this paper shows the potential of foresight for dealing with tourism development issues burdened by complexity and uncertainty, as well as its capability to bring down analysis from global challenges to local and spatial implications. A model framework is presented to incorporate foresight studies into the process of planning and designing tourist destinations. The model facilitates a gradual transition from a narrative vision to the spatial design of a future destination. Stakeholders play a very important role in the proposed model, being involved throughout the process in identifying future trends, formulating visions and helping to design urban patterns. In order to facilitate stakeholders' involvement, various analytical and design tools are used to envision the future development of tourist destinations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;"Destination design; Foresight; Futures studies; Strategic planning; Vision design";"Fernández-Güell, J.M.; Departamento de Urbanística y Ordenación del Territorio, Escuela de Arquitectura, Avenida Juan de Herrera 4, 28040 Madrid, Spain; email: josemiguel.fernandez@upm.es";;2615177;;;;English;Tour.

In order to project different alternative futures of health care for people with dementia (PwD) in Germany, we have initiated a multidisciplinary scenario process (Sce-Dem). Methods: For the scenario process we used a 6-step approach: (1) identification of relevant areas of influences via literature review and internet search, (2) systematic collection of relevant influence factors and their future projections via literature review, brainstorming and consensus workshops, (3) discussion and validation of the identified key factors in a workshop with 52 multidisciplinary, experts, to clarify their characteristics and future projections, (4) combining the relevant key factors with alternative projections in a so-called consistency matrix to estimate the consistency between the selected projections, (5) generating consistent combinations of projections using software, and (6) writing scenario stories and descriptions based on the most consistent and different combinations. Results: As a result of the scenario process, five consistent scenarios were developed. Two of these could be described as dark scenarios with very poor prospects. A third one has been referred to as ""well-meant, but badly done"". Two scenarios entail mostly positive aspects but one of them has a tendency towards, a ""health control"" state. Conclusion: The more positive scenarios provide a framework for determining relevant actions in research, society, and politics. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.";"Alzheimer's disease; Dementia; Foresight; Health services research; Scenario approach";"Vollmar, H.C.; Department of General Practice, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany; email: horst.vollmar@med.uni-duesseldorf.de";;1688510;;HEPOE;23958589;English;Health Policy;2-s2.0-84892679819;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

From this grounding discussion, the profiling of national/ social resilience is presented as a useful part of building an improved intelligence process of holistic change forecasting. Next, as a better way of seeing and evaluating how different nations and societies will uniquely respond to crises, uniquely recover post-crisis and thereafter change into their future, a way of using resilience change profiling to improve intelligence foresight and forecasting is detailed. Also, an argument is presented that during periods of financial stress, such an approach has efficacy, economy-of-force and other comparative advantage benefits to Western military organizations. © The Author(s) 2013.;"Forecasting; Intelligence; Resilience";"Werther, G.

The goal of the project is to develop web based tools which automatically detect activity and trends regarding given keywords. This knowledge can be used to enable decision makers to react proactively to arising challenges. As for now we can detect trends worldwide in more than 60 languages and assign these trends accordingly to over 100 national states. To reach this goal we utilize the big search engines as their core competence is to determine the relevance of a document regarding the search query. The search engines allows slicing of the results by language and country. In the next step we download some of the proposed documents for analysis. Because of the amount of information required we reach the field of Big Data. Therefore an extra effort is made to ensure scalability of the application. We introduce a new approach to activity and trend detection by combining the data collection and detection methods. To finally detect trends in the gathered data we use data mining methods which allow us to be independent from the language a document is written in. The input of these methods is the text data of the downloaded documents and a specially prepared index structure containing meta data and various other information which accumulate during the collection of the documents. We show that we can reliably detect trends and activities in highly active topics and discuss future research. © Jan Stutzki.;"Information retrieval; Trend detection; Web mining";"Stutzki, J.; Universität der Bundeswehr München, Werner-Heisenberg-Weg 39, Germany; email: jan.stutzki@unibw.de";Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing;21906807;9,78E+12;;;English;OpenAccess Ser.

Open-ended interviews with key actors closely involved in foresight activities have been woven together to create richly descriptive narrative-a story-of the project and its context(s). This paper finds that the meaning of the New Zealand Foresight Project (NZFP) has yet to stabilize-the unevenness in understanding among the actors, noted only in passing in an earlier study of the NZFP, appears to be a defining rather than incidental feature of the project and its legacy. There is significant disagreement about the aims, objectives, and outcomes of the project, and whether the NZFP should, ultimately, be understood as a success or failure. This paper also identifies a number of shortcomings in the NZFP that might serve as lessons and/or warnings for future, large-scale foresight activities. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight; History; New Zealand";"Chrystall, A.B.; School of Communication, Journalism and Marketing, Massey University (Albany Campus), Auckland, New Zealand; email: a.chrystall@massey.ac.nz";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Many studies investigate the revenue which could be achieved through arbitrage assuming perfect foresight of electricity prices. In practice, storage operators will not have perfect foresight and will have to devise operational strategies using price forecasts. This paper investigates the impact of forecast accuracy on the optimality of storage revenue. The optimal revenue available is determined using linear programming and historic electricity prices. The results are compared to those found using dynamic programming and electricity price forecasts with increasing percentage error. A small scale lithium ion battery and a large pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) device are compared. The results show that revenue reduces at an increasing rate with increasing forecast error. The PHES device is more sensitive to forecast accuracy than the lithium ion battery. For both technologies, with a maximum error of 30%, 80% of the optimal revenue can be achieved. With increased capacity and significantly increased power rating, the lithium ion battery becomes more sensitive to price forecast accuracy.;"Dynamic programming; Electricity storage; Forecast accuracy; Price arbitrage";"Harrison, G.P.; Institute for Energy Systems, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Mayfield Road, United Kingdom";Institution of Engineering and Technology;;;;;English;IET Conf Publ;2-s2.0-84912068376;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Lyngby, Denmark";;;The practice and concept of foresight have developed over several decades. However, the academic literature that addresses foresight is mainly descriptive, and it is generally acknowledged that there is a gap between practice and theory in foresight. This article contributes to building the theoretical underpinnings of foresight. The article explores the co-evolution of the academic field of innovation studies and the practice and concept of foresight. The article illustrates that foresight is importing the dominant understanding of innovation from innovation studies with a time lag. Currently, foresight is in a catching-up process vis-à-vis innovation studies by gradually incorporating the implications of a systemic understanding of innovation. The latter is reflected in the current research gaps in foresight. This paper concludes that the concept of innovation system foresight (ISF) constitutes an improved integration of the contemporary understanding of innovation into foresight. Furthermore, the article explores four preliminary implications of ISF on the conceptual design of foresight, including the goal of foresight, system definition and boundary setting, participation of actors, and finally, methods for mapping the present. These four implications also constitute avenues for further research. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Conceptual review; Foresight; Innovation systems; Systemic approach; Theoretical underpinnings";"Andersen, A.D.; Centre for Technology, Innovation and Culture, University of Oslo, Eilert Sundts Hus, Moltke Moes vei 31, 0851 Oslo, Norway; email: adahlandersen@gmail.com";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Until now, it has not been analyzed how this development affects the quality and structure of foresight processes. In this paper, a Delphi study is conducted to analyze the future path of ICT in foresight and to identify channels by which ICT drives progress in foresight and where there are limitations to this development. Using a real-time variant of the method, we posed 20 projections about ICT in 2020 to 177 foresight experts. In analyzing both quantitative and qualitative results of the study, we reveal that ICT will likely promote a shift in the focus of foresight exercises from scanning and data retrieval to more qualitative steps, such as interpretation, decision-making and implementation. In a growing foresight market, ICT should contribute to more efficient and accurate foresight processes with better accessibility to information, easy-to-use collaboration tools, data and knowledge linkages, quantitative modeling tools and process optimization. However, the qualitative nature of the discipline, value-driven challenges, as well as technological and competitive barriers should assure that foresight will remain a creative and human-centered activity with ICT tools only serving as supportive tools. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;"Data; Delphi method; Foresight; Foresight support systems; ICT";"Keller, J.; EBS Universitaet für Wirtschaft und Recht, EBS Business School, Konrad-Adenauer-Ring 15, 65187 Wiesbaden, Germany; email: jonas.keller@ebs.edu";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

PERSEUS-NET is a linear optimization model generating scenarios of the future German electricity generation system until 2030, whilst considering exogenous regional characteristics such as electricity demand and existing power plants as well as electricity transmission network restrictions. Up to now, the model has been based on a perfect foresight approach, optimizing all variables over the whole time frame in a single run, thus determining the global optimum. However, this approach results in long computing times due to the high complexity of the problem. The new myopic approach splits the optimization intomultiple, individually smaller, optimization problems each representing a 5 year period. The change within the generation system in each period is determined by optimizing the subproblem, whilst taking into account only the restrictions of that particular period. It was found that the optimization over the whole time frame with the myopic approach takes less than one tenth of the computing time of the perfect foresight approach. Therefore, we analyse in this paper the advantages and draw-backs of a change in the foresight as a way of reducing the complexity of energy system models. For PERSEUS-NET it is found that the myopic approach with stable input parameters is as suitable as the perfect foresight approach to generate consistent scenarios, with the advantage of significantly less computing time. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.;"Energy system modelling; Myopic; Perfect foresight; PERSEUS";"Babrowski, S.; Department of Energy Economics, Institute for Industrial Production (IIP), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Hertzstraße 16, 76187 Karlsruhe, Germany; email: Sonja.Babrowski@kit.edu";Springer Verlag;18683967;;;;English;Energy Syst.;2-s2.0-84898954719;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus, the relevant areas where foresight might contribute are: knowledge, networking, and coping with a 'risk society'. The new framework is built on the features and pre-conditions of more participatory societies and draws upon existing evaluation approaches and concepts (""theory-based evaluation"", ""knowledge value framework"", ""behavioural"" and ""cognitive capacity additionality"") to tackle short-comings of earlier evaluation efforts.

The potential benefits of public procurement might be fully exploited through the acquisition not only of appliances which are already available in the market, but also of new appliances which are tailored to the specific needs of the local community and might be exported as well to the international markets. In this way, public procurement might allow to improve the services delivered to the local community and to increase the technological competitiveness of the local industrial and research system. In this context, regional foresight might help identify both long-term societal needs and the patterns of evolution of emerging technologies that can match these needs.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of collaborative, bottom-up strategic planning as a complement to top-down strategizing. Large research institutions plan investment over long time horizons and must cope with significant uncertainty, complexity, and mandate changes. Collaborative foresight enhances organizational resilience by improving ideation, problem definition, and consensus in long-horizon strategies. It increases the variety of perspectives in scenario creation, resulting in improved strategic options. Structured Dialogic Design (SDD) was employed as a complementary strategic planning method to the mandated Capabilities-Based Planning (CBP) process. The two methods were conducted in parallel sessions with different organizational participants, strictly limiting information sharing between teams. Participants using SDD to plan efficiently produced a detailed structure representing long-horizon strategic challenges and solution ideas. This collaborative foresight approach demonstrated strong consensus for organizational priorities defined in scenarios and investment pathways. The SDD method demonstrated that transactive and generative planning integrated with traditional rational planning and surpassed it by incorporating deep tacit knowledge from diverse participants. It also fostered organizational cohesion through facilitated collaboration in the planning sessions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;"Collaborative planning; Influence mapping; Strategic foresight; Strategy; Structured dialogic design";"Jones, P.; OCAD University, 7 Fraser Ave., Toronto, ON, Canada; email: pjones@ocadu.ca";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The analysis focuses on the energy intensity of the GDP, and is modeled on conservative, innovative and accelerated scenarios for long-term socio-economic development in the Russian Federation until the year 2030. The article studies the practical application of modern technological foresight using the examples of two priority areas for the development of science, technology and equipment in the Russian Federation. The two examples used are ‘effective environmental management’ and ‘energy efficiency and conservation’. We examine a list of national critical technologies that correspond to these priority areas in the aspects of long-term scientific, technological, socio-economic prognosis, and fiscal policies to stimulate corporate expenditures on research and development. Then, we evaluate the guidelines for Russian ecological development policies in the period until 2030. The guidelines are aimed at solving socio-economic problems by providing low-carbon solutions for sustainable development, as well as the preservation of the environment, biodiversity, natural resources, and the realization of every person’s right to a clean environment. A comparative analysis has been performed on ‘effective environmental management’ as well as ‘energy efficiency and conservation’, which are designated as national priorities of the Russian Federation, and ‘green technology’, a priority of international centers of scientific and technological development. Finally, conclusions were drawn about the potential impact of the mass use of energy-efficient technologies to reduce the anthropogenic load on the environment by reducing energy intensity, as well as about improving the ecological situation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants. The approaches to the development of recommendations for the implementation of general provisions for the ‘Russian Climate Doctrine’ in part increase energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, and also decrease market disproportions by implementing financial and fiscal policy measures which stimulate the reduction of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. © SGEM2014.;"Climate Doctrine of the Russian Federation; Ecological development policies; National critical technologies; Strategic planning; Technological foresight";;International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference;13142704;;;;English;Int.

It was on the occasion of a visit to the New York World's Fair in 1964 that the famous science fiction writer Isaac Asimov decided to jump forward half a century and imagine what might be on show at the 2014 equivalent. In that article, published in 1964, Asimov showed astonishing foresight, whether it be about modes of transport, telecommunications, automation, demographic growth or the in-built limitations of our planet. And if at times Asimov was wrong (he thought, for example, that human beings would by now have built under the ground and beneath the oceans), re-reading this piece in the very year when its predictions are set reveals the powers of anticipation he possessed. To undertake a similar exercise today and attempt to forecast technological developments in 2064 would undoubtedly be a risky enterprise - mainly on account of the marked acceleration in the pace of technological advance.;;"Asimov, I.; Robots ou du cycle FondationFrance";Futuribles;0337307X;;;;French;Futuribles Anal.

Gas-fired generating units act as a link between the gas and electricity networks. The variability of wind power is, therefore, transferred to the gas network by influencing the gas demand for electricity generation. Operation of a GB integrated gas and electricity network considering the uncertainty in wind power forecast was investigated using three operational planning methods: deterministic, two-stage stochastic programming, and multistage stochastic programming. These methods were benchmarked against a perfect foresight model which has no uncertainty associated with the wind power forecast. In all the methods, thermal generators were controlled through an integrated unit commitment and economic dispatch algorithm that used mixed integer programming. The nonlinear characteristics of the gas network, including the gas flow along pipes and the operation of compressors, were taken into account and the resultant nonlinear problem was solved using successive linear programming. The operational strategies determined by the stochastic programming methods showed reductions of the operational costs compared to the solution of the deterministic method by almost 1%. Also, using the stochastic programming methods to schedule the thermal units was shown to make a better use of pumped storage plants to mitigate the variability and uncertainty of the net demand. © 2013 IEEE.;"Integrated gas and electricity network; Stochastic programming; Wind power forecast uncertainty";Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Cardiff University, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom;;19493029;;;;English;IEEE Trans.

The loss of an ability to control artificial intelligent and autonomous decision systems (AADS) due to their high level of sophistication exceeding human analytic capabilities may be referred to as one aspect of 'singularity'. The latter term is often used to describe potential threats to the mankind coming from the development of AADS that may outperform human intelligence in its most relevant aspects. This paper presents some results of a recent foresight project SCETIST which shed a new light on the above 'singularity' dilemma. The project aimed at building the scenarios and trends of selected advanced information technologies. Based on a classification of AI enabling technologies, two basic scenarios concerning the development of AADS have been built. The first one points out that the newly emerging global expert systems (GES) coupled with the Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) will allow the human societies to explore in full all data streams and knowledge repositories available. The global knowledge from all sources will be further processed by GES so that rational human decisions will not be outperformed by those made by AADS. In the second scenario, the AADS enabling technologies will develop faster than BCI and GES, so that autonomous decision systems can dominate. The third scenario, ranked as least probable, indicates a possibility of slowing down the development of ICT and AI, so that the singularity problem is deferred. The time horizon of the above scenarios was 2030. Finally, we will present the recommendations arising from SCETIST from the point of view of shaping the R&D policies. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.;"AI Foresight; Anticipatory Networks; Artificial Autonomous Systems; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Global Expert Systems; IT Scenarios";"Skulimowski, A.M.J.; Department of Automatic Control and Biomedical Engineering, Decision Science Laboratory, AGH University of Science and Technology, 30-050 Krakow, Poland; email: ams@agh.edu.pl";Springer Verlag;3029743;9,78E+12;;;English;Lect.

In the article, three major traditions of business research (theory of creative destruction, OLC/LCC theory and business war gaming framework) are elaborated and linked to the studies of pirate entrepreneurship. These theoretical approaches help to link the issue of pirate entrepreneurship to foresight research. The key conclusion of the research is that probably new forms of dynamic pirate entrepreneurship can provide new solutions to the triple challenge problem of innovation management, i.e., problems related to creative destruction, disruptive innovations, and creative accumulation. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.;"Business war gaming; Creative accumulation; Disruptive innovation; Dynamic capabilities; Knowledge brokering; Life cycle theory; Pirate entrepreneurship; Schumpeterian theory of creative destruction; Triple challenge of knowledge management";"Kaivo-Oja, J.; Finland Futures Research Centre, Turku School of Economics, Unit of Tampere, Yliopistonkatu 58 D, 33100 Tampere, Finland; email: jari.kaivo-oja@utu.fi";;14761297;;;;English;Int.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on theory from innovation systems and strategic foresight. First, a review of literature was carried out and an innovation systems model of the FM sector was developed. Second, four national workshops were held involving FM practitioners and researchers from Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Third, the results of the workshops were presented and discussed at a Nordic FM conference in August 2011. Finally, an adapted Delphi survey was carried out as a final data collection and validation of the findings. This article has the main focus on the results of the Delphi survey. Findings: The results of the study show that the main issues vary considerably between the four countries, both with regards to megatrends in the strategic environments, the current trends and challenges and the future needs for new competences and knowledge. Despite the large national differences the study is able to identify joint interest across the four countries. Based on the study a common Nordic research agenda is proposed with two headlines: Valuation and professionalization of FM, and Resources and sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The study provides directions for future research with particular focus on the Nordic countries in Europe. Practical implications: The study identifies trends and challenges as well as need for new knowledge and competences for FM practice in each of the four Nordic countries. Originality/value: This is the first comprehensive foresight study aimed at developing a research agenda for FM across the Nordic countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Facilities management; Forecasting; Innovation; Research; Systems analysis";"Jensen, P.

The present paper follows this tradition and describes a prototype of a care robot that is endowed with affective capabilities. The paper describes some of the potential ethical problems arising from such a technology. This aspect of the paper is based on prior research in a European-funded technology foresight project that explored the ethical issues of emerging ICTs. The paper goes beyond the description of technical innovation and its ethical consequences. The recognition of the ethical relevance of research and innovation has spawned a discourse around responsible research and innovation. The paper draws on this discourse, which aims at anticipatory technology governance to ensure the social acceptability and desirability of technologies. The prototype vignette of the paper explores how responsible research and innovation could be realised in practice and how it could be used to address ethical issues such as those of affective care robots. The paper reflects the likely controversies that responsible research and innovation is likely to create and it uses the ethical dilemma of the care robot to draw the reader's attention to possible theoretical and practical conclusions. © 2013 The Authors.;"Creative prototyping; Emerging technology; Ethics; ICT; Responsible research and innovation; Robotics";"Stahl, B.C.; De Montfort University, Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, The Gateway, Leicester LE1 9BH, United Kingdom; email: bstahl@dmu.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Accurate forecasting is a great help for companies in making the best decisions in terms of unit commitment, production, and maintenance planning. It is necessary for the companies to have prior foresight of future demand with adequate accuracy. Some data mining algorithms play the greatest role in predicting the demand forecasting. As a regular data-driven method, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are popular in energy forecasting. This paper investigated the application of the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a forecasting tool for predicting the energy demand in Turkey. The benefit of the proposed model is forecasting energy needs through the evaluation of ANFIS application using data sets processed with principle component analysis (PCA) and collected from the energy forecast shootout (EFS) and Ministry of Natural Resources Turkey. The results showed that the hybrid ANFIS model based upon fuzzy logic (FL) and ANN performed efficiently in term of forecast accuracy. Thus, it could be regarded as an alternative method in energy forecasting. Finally, the application of ANFIS in a long term energy forecasting was provided, and the results were interpreted.

The future that is being imagined however often exhibits a form of techno-optimism. This paper critiques that optimism by describing the #Patchworks project in which science fiction prototypes were used to explore the social implications of who does the imagining. Through our vignette we explore how the promissory nature of science fiction prototyping folds back into the present to change current understandings of real life situations. We suggest that the power to imagine and invent futures is often not extended to vulnerable communities, nor does it take into account the differing authority and agency depending on who is telling and who feels able to tell stories. The collision between these different stories and backgrounds in #Patchworks, the co-design project informing this paper, has produced contradictions and negotiations between the speculative practice of 'tinkering' used by DIY hackers that act as 'openings', an academic focus on innovation and the 'anchoring' inherent in the need to produce practical prototypes that solve urgent problems. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;"Co-design; Community; Foresight; Future imaginaries; Innovation; Science fiction prototyping";"Southern, J.; Sociology Department, Lancaster University, Bowland North, Lancaster, LA1 4YT, United Kingdom; email: j.a.southern@lancaster.ac.uk";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Particularly in Policy Delphi surveys and related variations that strive to explore opposing views, the diversity of the Delphi panel has been scrutinised. In the majority of earlier Policy Delphi studies, expertise accounted for the most predominant panel selection criterion. However, further surface- and deep-level diversity dimensions discussed in related social science research need to be incorporated for steering diversity in panel selection. In this article, the main effects of surface- and deep-level panel diversity on response behaviour are examined, focussing on extreme response style (ERS). Moreover, interaction phenomena of diversity variables are considered. By conducting a Policy Delphi in real-time format on the future of multimodal mobility, we demonstrate that value attributes significantly influence extreme response behaviour while expertise is especially important in combination with various other diversity variables. Furthermore, we identified a moderating effect of age on the relationship between environmental value characteristics and Delphi panellists' response behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;"Extreme response style (ERS); Multimodal mobility; Panel diversity; Policy Delphi; Sampling";"Spickermann, A.; Friedrich-Alexander-University (FAU) Erlangen-Nuremberg, Lange Gasse 20, 90403 Nuremberg, Germany; email: alexander_spickermann@gmx.de";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

I focus primarily on children's knowledge about emotions and decisions caused by being reminded about the past and thinking about the future.

The LSA concept aims at improving spectrum usage efficiency by introducing additional licensed spectrum users on spectrum bands whose incumbent use would permit it, while guaranteeing certain quality of service (QoS) for all users. The LSA concept could help mobile network operators (MNOs) to gain access to new spectrum bands on a shared basis in a timely manner. As the LSA concept is based on voluntariness, it needs to provide incentives for the incumbent spectrum users for the introduction of sharing. Using a foresight approach called integral scenario methodology, we propose a set of scenarios for incumbent spectrum users in LSA based on their business focus (defensive vs. aggressive) and mode of change (open vs. closed). The created scenarios are described and analyzed from regulation, business and technology perspectives, highlighting the business potential created by the introduction of LSA. The evaluation of the developed business scenarios indicates that a defensive approach for the business focus for incumbents might be preferred to focus narrowly on traditional business models. However, an aggressive approach to pursue new business opportunities with LSA might open up new opportunities which, today, cannot yet be foreseen. © 2014 ICST.;"Business Scenarios; Licensed Shared Access; LSA; Spectrum sharing";"Ahokangas, P.; Oulu Business School, Oulu, Finland; email: Petri.Ahokangas@oulu.fi";IEEE Computer Society;;9,78E+12;;;English;Proc.

Some examples are technology intelligence, forecasting, road mapping, and foresight. All of these techniques fit into a field that we call Technology Futures Analysis (TFA). Unfortunately, both competitive and forecasting analyses are not well utilized in company decision-making, especially those based on analytical patent analysis. Three factors could enhance managerial utilization: capability to exploit huge volumes of available information, ways to do it very quickly, and informative representations that help to discover emerging technologies. This paper reports an effort to address these three goals via a brand new method of analysis conceived to quickly and graphically generate helpful knowledge from patents. The first novelty is to adopt a function-oriented process to identify the most important features of a product or technology. Then, we exemplify a method to manage patent search that integrates functional basis with physical and chemical effects library. The outcome is a concise and graphical state of art, which helps to define players and patterns in the development of a target technology. This takes the form of a infographic map, and is finally used to discover emerging technologies, white space opportunities or new market potentials.

Design/methodology/approach: First the authors define the potential changes in financial markets and then the tools available for the regulator to tame them. Finally, they build five scenarios according to the main evolutions observed on the financial markets and on the tools used by the regulator to modify these trends. Findings: Among the five scenarios defined, two present highly unstable features since the regulator refuses to choose between financial opening and independently determining how to regulate finance in order to preserve financial stability. Three of them achieve financial stability. However, they are more or less efficient or feasible. In terms of market efficiency, the multi-polar scenario is the best and the fragmentation scenario is the worst, since gains of integration depend on the size of the new capital market. Regarding sovereignty of regulation, fragmentation is the best scenario and the multi-polar scenario is the worst, because it necessitates coordination at the global level which implies moving further away from respective national preferences. However, the more realistic option seems to be the regionalisation scenario: this level of coordination seems much more realistic than the global one; the market should be of sufficient size to enjoy substantial benefits of integration. Nevertheless, the ""European government"" might gradually increase the degree of financial integration outside Europe in line with the degree of cooperation with the rest of the world. Originality/value: Foresight studies on financial markets and regulation are quite rare. This may be explained by the difficulty to forecast what will be their evolution in the coming decades, not least because finance is fundamentally unstable. This paper provides a framework to consider what could be the best strategy of regulators in such an unstable environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";"Financial integration; Financial stability; Supervision and regulation";"Gossé, J.-B.; Centre for Financial Analysis and Policy, Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; email: jg548@cam.ac.uk";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-84900405186;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Whilst emphasising the role of the asymmetry volatility model in portfolio formation, we also investigate the economic implication of the smooth transition exponential smoothing (STES) method in portfolio risk management. Our results suggest that all portfolios perform better in the ex-post period compared to the ex-ante period. However, investors may not be able to obtain any benefits from diversifying their portfolio in developed stock markets in both ex-ante and ex-post periods. Further investigation on the economic implications of the STES method also show that the STES method does help to cushion losses generated from the international diversification portfolio. Hence, this suggests the use of the STES method in computing and monitoring the risk of an internationally diversified portfolio. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.;"Asymmetry volatility model; Ex-ante; Ex-post; International portfolio diversification (IPD) benefits; Smooth transition exponential smoothing (STES)";"Nie, U.S.; Graduate School of Management, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPMMalaysia";Universiti Sains Malaysia;18234992;;;;English;Asian Acad.

Part one examines the role of denialism in the context of proposals advanced through the much-abused Limits to Growth (LtG) project. Part two uses three sets of criteria (domains of reality, worldviews and values) to characterise some of the interior human and social aspects of the “denial machine.” It uses these criteria to address some vital, but currently under-appreciated “interior” aspects of descent. (N.B. A succinct “primer” or overview of the concept an underpinning rationale for notions of “descent pathways” is provided in the introduction to this special issue.) Design/methodology/approach-The paper draws on a number of authoritative sources that track the dimensions of global change and, specifically, the ways that humanity is tracking towards Dystopian overshoot-and-collapse futures. The significance of the LtG project is assessed in this context. Part two employs the criteria noted above to identify and open out the centrality of the human and cultural interiors. Findings-Responses to the LtG project are shown to have deprived humanity of the clarity and will to respond effectively to the emerging global emergency. The rise of climate change denialism has followed suit and made effective responses increasingly difficult. A new focus, however, on some of the dynamics of reality domains, worldviews and values, clarifies both the nature of the problem and prefigures a range of solutions, some of which are briefly outlined. Research limitations/implications-This is primarily a conceptual paper that suggests a range of practical responses. For example, re-purposing parts of the current information technology (IT) infrastructure away from financial and economic indices to those tracking the health of the planet. Also translating the case put forward here for a new generation of Institutions of Foresight (IoFs) into real-world start-ups and examples. Further research is needed into the uses and limitation, both of positive and negative views of futures. It is suggested that the latter have more value than is commonly realised. Practical implications-In addition to those stated above, the practical implications include new uses for IT infrastructure based on worldcentric-rather than financial and economic worldviews; designing and implementing a new generation of IoFs; and finding new ways to inform the public of impending Dystopian outcomes without exacerbating avoidance and depression. Social implications-The social implications are profound. Currently, humanity has allowed itself to “tune out” and ignore many of the well-founded “signals” (from the global system) and warnings (from those who have observed and tracked real-world changes). As a result, it has outgrown the capacity of the planet to support the current population, let alone the 10 billion currently projected by the United Nations (UN). Something must give. Applied foresight can provide essential lead time to act before human actions are overwhelmed by forces beyond its control. Originality/value-The paper draws together material from hitherto disparate sources to assess the LtG project. It also deploys key concepts from an integral perspective that shed new light on human and cultural forces that determine how people respond to the prospect of Dystopian futures. In so doing, it provides insight into why we are where we are and also into some of the means by which humanity can respond. Specifically, it suggests a shift from collapse narratives to those of descent. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";"Denialism; Descent pathways; Global emergency; Human and cultural interiors; Limits to growth; Trajectory of development";"Slaughter, R.A.; Foresight InternationalAustralia";Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-84926323093;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The study compares an optimal economic allocation for groundwater use subject to streamflow constraints, achieved by a central planner with perfect foresight, with a uniform tax on groundwater use and a uniform quota on groundwater use. The policies are compared with two modeling approaches, the Optimal Control Model (OCM) and the Multi-Agent System Simulation (MASS). The economic decision models are coupled with a physically based representation of the aquifer using a calibrated MODFLOW groundwater model. The results indicate that uniformly applied policies perform poorly when simulated with more realistic, heterogeneous, myopic, and self-interested agents. In particular, the effects of the physical heterogeneity of the basin and the agents undercut the perceived benefits of policy instruments assessed with simple, single-cell groundwater modeling. This study demonstrates the results of coupling realistic hydrogeology and human behavior models to assess groundwater management policies. The Republican River Basin, which overlies a portion of the Ogallala aquifer in the High Plains of the United States, is used as a case study for this analysis.

'Ihese new lessons do not obliterate ongoing challenges that predated Sandy.

ANTICIPATING DISRUPTION Planning is by its very nature an optimistic enterprise, but life can be messy Setbacks of all sorts happen to individu- als, their neighborhoods, whole communities, and even na- tions. in this context a communit's willingness to examine its hazards and to anticipate and plan tbr potentia] disasters important.

States also act as agents of numerous federal progrm11i otten icting vs ith authot its delegated to them from tedei ii agencies Resilient Management The most essential element of resilient management may be a purely human one: the courage to make toLigh decisions. Without that, all else may fail, But it is also important to perceive the city as a system of systems, within which resilience can be embodied at a number of ]c'vels. Resilient systems base identifiable characteristics that include diversity, redun dancv, decentralization, transparency, collaboration, grace in failure, flexibility, and foresight, Risk management, closely related to resilient manage- ment, can he achieved through cost-heneht analysis. The Governmental Finance Officers Association has established a framework for such analysis to help ensure that cominu- ni[ies have the resources to overcome foreseeable setbacks. Risk management also occurs through mitigation, which in pai t is mattel ot propei I) investing i esoutces to achieve risk reduction, for instaice, by removing homes from the flood- plain and thus reducing the amount of vulnerable property iii need ci pmtection. The challenge with hazard mitigation as a risk reduction tool lies in incorporating it into the rest of the planning process rather than isolating it.

California provides one ex rimental ample, wheiestate law mandate.s the inclusion of a 'safety' element, which has evolved to cover numerous hazards, such as floods and earthquakes. California is one of at least ten states with mandates or prescriptions for such elements.

In this study, based on the experience in the pilot projects for technology foresight implemented by the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (Japan) in 2007 and 2008, we applied multiple foresight methods, including the Delphi method, in an attempt to design a new technology foresight method oriented toward vision creation on ageing society in Japan. As a result, we could develop a final vision in a clearer form by applying multiple methods and reflecting the survey results obtained by each method. The process of preparing for the Delphi survey is also suggested to be effective in promoting the formation of a consensus among experts of different fields, which also works well toward vision creation.

Adopting a case-based approach, three software companies engaged in four new product development projects served as our empirical research sites. With emphasis placed on their innovation teams' everyday practices, data for the empirical inquiry were collected using the qualitative methods of semistructured interviews, ethnographical observation and project archival documents. Explicating the observed foresightful practices and their underlying activities under the general rubrics of organizing architecture and social co-ordination, we identified over-compartmentalization, over-determinism and (in)congruence-of-values as quintessentially embedded organizing practices, that constitutively enable (or impede) organizational foresightfulness. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the managerial implications and some limitations of our research. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;"(In)congruence-of-values; Organising architecture; Organizational foresight; Product innovation teams; Social co-ordination; Social practices";"Sarpong, D.; Bristol Business School, University of the West of England, Coldharbour lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom; email: David2.Sarpong@uwe.ac.uk";;2632373;;;;English;Eur.

Such quality criteria can be defined relative to the intended function of the knowledge. Plausibility has emerged as a central quality criterion of scenarios that allows exploring the future with credibility and saliency. But what exactly is plausibility vis-à-vis probability, consistency, and desirability? And how can plausibility be evaluated and constructed in scenarios? Sufficient plausibility, in this article, refers to scenarios that hold enough evidence to be considered 'occurrable'. This might have been the underlying idea of scenarios all along without being explicitly elaborated in a pragmatic concept or methodology. Here, we operationalise plausibility in scenarios through a set of plausibility indications and illustrate the proposal with scenarios constructed for Phoenix, Arizona. The article operationalises the concept of plausibility in scenarios to support scholars and practitioners alike.

It explicitly highlights how a common future-oriented proactive attitude built-up in participative stakeholder communication networks can assist in shaping and creating a vision of a less uncertain and ambiguous future. First, the advancement of the disaster management concept and its various stages, including risk analysis, mitigation and response are explained. Forward-looking activities on short- and long-term temporal scales are introduced and put into a disaster risk management context. Recent developments in risk and crisis communication are discussed as evolving in a new environment that emphasizes network-centric communication shaped by the increasing influence of web 2.0 social media platforms. It is further described how future-oriented processes and inherent communication approaches can improve disaster risk management. Finally, the various time-scale-dependent future-oriented activities are conceptually integrated into a framework of risk governance. Active and participative communication is thereby seen as the key for successfully implementing risk governance and favor disaster mitigation and future risk reduction.;"Foresight and strategic planning; Forward-looking activities; Participative communication; Prediction and forecast; Risk governance; Situational awareness";"Christoph, A.; AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Foresight and Policy Development Department, Donau-City-Str. 1, A-1220 Vienna, Austria; email: christoph.aubrecht@ait.ac.at";;0974262X;;;;English;Disaster Adv.;2-s2.0-84889055744;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its future milestones lie in two key dimensions: social - combating common and complex diseases, and economic - establishing S&T basis that will provide leadership, or at least a decent niche in the global markets. The paper provides the results of a study conducted by the HSE in cooperation with the member organizations of technology platform ""Medicine of the Future"". It supposes and empirically tests the feasibility of matching challenges and responses aimed at selecting the priorities of S&T development. The study identified underlying trends and S&T areas that will shape the medium and long term prospects of medicine, as well as backlogs allowing gaining strong global market positions. The possible technology responses for the most significant healthcare challenges for Russia are identified, and a priority research agenda is proposed. The authors conclude that Russia lacks breakthrough S&T capacities in the majority of promising medical areas. Meanwhile, domestic advances in some fields still offer the chance for a breakthrough and gaining solid positions on global markets as well as for integration in the value chain. Time to catch up with these opportunities however is running out: most of them are estimated to be available only for the next 5-7 years, so urgent actions are required. These results have been widely discussed in the framework of a range of communication platforms, including that of expert groups preparing the draft state-run programme «Development of Science and Technology for the period up to 2020», and working committees of the technology platform «Medicine of the Future», which are presented at Russian and international conferences.";"Global challenges; Innovation policy; Long-term forecast; Medicine and healthcare; Priority areas; S&T capacities; S&T policy";Sectoral forecasting centre, Siberian State Medical University, 2, Moskovskiy trakt, Tomsk, 634050, Russian Federation;;1995459X;;;;Russian;Foresight Russ.;2-s2.0-84884522141;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Foresight can be complicated because dispersed groups have diverse, non-overlapping pieces of information that affects an organization's ability to detect, mitigate, and recover from failures. This paper explores the failure of foresight in crisis management by drawing on data on events that preceded and followed the Mari disaster in a naval base in Cyprus in July 2011, where a large explosion killed 13 people and injured 62 others, while completely destroying the major power plant of the island. The paper examines how foresight into crisis management decisions was compromised because of a conscious effort by high ranking decision-makers to minimize emergent danger and avoid responsibility for the crisis, in joint with red tape, bureaucracy, and poor coordination and information flows. The paper explores the notion of operational and political responsibility of individual decision-makers and discusses an alternative approach to foresight in crisis management, one that is built on multiple layers of decision-making. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;"Crisis management; Disasters; Failure of foresight; Multi-layered decision-making; Responsibility";"Constantinides, P.; Information Systems and Management Group, Warwick Business School, Warwick University, Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom; email: panos.constantinides@wbs.ac.uk";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The aim of this paper is to briefly describe the risks and institutions dealing with disasters, to assess the emergency preparedness, the uses of Knowledge Management Systems and Foresight Methodology approaches and to discover the shortcomings of the Romanian Emergency System. The empirical study designed as a reality check focuses on the perception of the local leaders of the emergency system regarding the most probable risks, and the uses and utility of long term strategic planning and foresight methodologies, using the Delphi technique. Lessons drawn from the Romanian transition could provide an interesting case study for other emerging democracies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;"Delphi; Foresight; Knowledge Management; Romanian Emergency System; Strategic planning";"Zulean, M.Bd Elisabeta 4-12, Bucharest, Romania; email: mzulean@faa.ro";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Scenarios can enhance the understanding of emergency teams about the factors which are involved in the definition of an emergency plan and how different actors participate in it. The version of Cross-Impact Analysis described aims at contributing to this goal through allowing the collaborative development of scenarios out of large event sets. This ultimately reduces the complexity for estimating a working model. In order to illustrate this research effort hypothetical results of a dirty bomb attack scenario exercise are presented, along with the final estimates of relationships based on four rounds of individual estimates followed by discussion of differences in the perceived relationships, in order to achieve a ""consensus"" model. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the ability of a group to create a working model of the scenario that may be used to examine the consequences of various assumptions about preparedness, plans, and the actions taken during the crisis situation. The method may be used as either a planning tool and/or a training tool. We discuss the process for collecting inputs from a collaborative group and how to improve the consistency of the group inputs in a Delphi-like feedback process.

In particular, risks associated with global supply chains are special since they involve a multitude of international stakeholders with different perspectives on security needs and measures. Therefore, it is essential to determine which techniques and instruments are best suited for risk assessment in complex and multi-organizational environments. The Delphi expert survey technique has proven to be a valuable instrument for long-term decision making support as well as foresight, and has a potential value for risk assessment. We contribute to this research strand and conduct a Delphi-based risk analysis. Our research concentrates on man-made risks in global supply chains which are particularly uncertain in terms of type, location, and affected supply chain partners and can therefore be classified as inherently ""wicked"" issues, i.e. issues that are multidimensional with often unpleasant outcomes. We illustrate that Delphi research makes a fivefold contribution to risk analysis by: (1) identifying and quantifying risks; (2) analyzing stakeholder perceptions and worldviews; (3) stimulating a global communication process; (4) identifying weak signals, outlier opinions, and wildcards; (5) and facilitating risk scenario development. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.";"Delphi; Future; Multi-stakeholder; Risk; Supply chain security; Terroristic attacks";"Markmann, C.; Institute for Futures Studies and Knowledge Management (IFK), EBS Business School, Konrad-Adenauer-Ring 15, 65187 Wiesbaden, Germany; email: Christoph.Markmann@ebs.edu";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

For technology foresight, monitoring and analyzing energy technologies is in the spotlight due to their strategic importance to the agenda of competitive and sustainable economic growth. Design/methodology/approach: The trends in renewable energy production and news media are determined and compared to draw inferences in foresight concerning the use of renewable energy technologies in energy production. Consequently, the data concern wind and solar energy production and their representation in news media in Germany and the UK. The analysis proceeds as a quasi-experiment treating each yearly observation of energy production as a function of news media data with lagged variables. Findings: The study reveals consistent dynamics in the lag in the primary production of energy in related technologies compared to the media visibility of the respective technologies. Originality/value: This study explores the prospects of using news media data in foresight analysis concerning renewable energy production and provides many fruitful avenues for foresight research in investigating relationships between technology adoption and media exposure. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Energy management; European Union; Forecasting; Strategic planning";"Mäkinen, S.

The intent is to enable simple yet reliable enterprise assessment of triple bottom line (TBL) performance and produce actionable enterprise foresight that can enable next best practices and sources of sustainable competitive advantage through innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Key elements of SEE are identified from various business excellence and sustainability reporting sources, including the Global Reporting Initiative, the UN Global Compact 10 Principles, and criteria of the European Quality Award and America's Baldrige National Quality Award. From these a model and key criteria are distilled, maturity scales developed, and a simple means of assessment presented. Findings: A compact model and supporting maturity assessment approach similar in structure to those behind established excellence awards are developed that enable enterprise assessment of progress toward SEE. The resulting assessment is delivered in a highly consumable, combined narrative and graphic format referred to as a SEE NEWS Report. Practical implications: The assessment approach presented enables both enterprise progress toward Sustainable Enterprise Excellence and enterprise-to-enterprise comparability. Foresight provided by the assessment enables further advancement. Social implications: The social and environmental dimensions of SEE imply that enterprises progressing with respect to its model will of necessity contribute positively to the social fabric. Originality/value: Sustainable Enterprise Excellence as superior TBL performance resulting from integration of ethical, effective and efficient governance with triple top line strategy is developed, together with a means of maturity assessment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Governance; Innovation for sustainability; Maturity assessment; Performance dashboard; Resilience; Sustainable Enterprise Excellence; Sustainable innovation; SWOT plot narrative; Triple bottom line performance; Triple top line strategy";"Edgeman, R.; AU-Herning and the Interdisciplinary Center for Organizational Architecture, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; email: rledge@asb.dk";;14720701;;;;English;Corp.

Too much is made of secrecy, and of covert operations and counter-intelligence (action domains informed by intelligence rather than integral to it). Intelligence is often focused on threats, missing opportunities for advantage. A standard definition is proposed for better understanding of intelligence by the academy, media and public. Intelligence is a corporate capability to forecast change in time to do something about it. The capability involves foresight and insight, and is intended to identify impending change which may be positive, representing opportunity, or negative, representing threat.

This fostered the redesigning of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy frameworks to adjust the scope and priorities of STI funding and to elaborate a new set of long-term strategic planning documents, in particular, to revise the Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight. Since S&T and broader socio-economic processes are closely interrelated, the new macroeconomic forecasting is a key building block for updating Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight; it is carried out by the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting (CMASF). The article presents interim results, namely, a set of possible scenarios of global development and their projections for Russia. The scenarios at the global level are determined by the pace and nature of the economic recovery worldwide, as well as by the opportunities and consequences of technological breakthroughs in the energy sector, which is expected to have the largest impact on development of the world economy. The energy sector transformation is encouraged by new technological solutions, and these can translate into large-scale market transformation with huge economic effect. The content of scenarios at the national level depends on the adaptation of the economy to the changing context of the world markets. Adaptation, in turn, determines the patterns of managing resource rents and foreign investment, as well as positioning in growing markets. The ""inflation technological breakthrough"" scenario presupposes the availability of abundant savings worldwide, whose targeted investment could result in the next technological breakthrough. It will help integrate Russia into global production chains. If the ""boom"" on financial markets does result in technological breakthrough, however, the world will be subjected to high inflation, and the high oil prices will spark the development of non-traditional hydrocarbon fuels (""energy inflation"" scenario). There are two options for Russia in this case, each of which has its pros and cons. The first presumes recapitalizing traditional assets. The second relies on building competitive advantage through the development of public-private partnerships, attracting direct portfolio investment, updating scale production and reforming institutions. Finally, if a recovery from the global crisis is protracted, the best ""recipe"" is ""creative destruction"" - eliminating the outdated and inefficient industries while creating opportunities for the development of more advantageous companies that will provide a qualitatively new basis for growth.";"Economic growth; Foreign direct investment; Global crisis; Global scenarios; Long-term forecast; Macroeconomic forecast; Scenarios for Russia; World market";Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, 47, Nakhimovsky av., Moscow, 117418, Russian Federation;;1995459X;;;;Russian;Foresight Russ.;2-s2.0-84884524804;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By global expert system (GES) we mean all knowledge sources, bases, repositories, and processing units, regardless of whether they are human, artificial, animal, or hybrid, such that the relation ""able to transfer knowledge on immediate demand"" forms a connected graph over the elements of the system. A key requirement is that problem solving using GES is an anytime process with respect to the number of information sources taken into account. We conjecture that due to the high and ever-growing level of interconnection of knowledge units, a universal intelligence emerges, which under specific conditions can outperform the intelligence and creativity of any of its individual elements, including humans. It will be shown that this is possible only if an appropriate level of credibility can be assigned to each element of the system, which ensures that users trust the responses.

The paper applies the ""Limits to Growth"" thinking and suggests an approach where the concept of material and population growth is questioned. Findings: Multidisciplinary examination of research literature reveals what is normally considered to be problems such as energy, food and water scarcity, poverty and environmental degradation really are not problems but symptoms; the problem is the continuing economic and population growth on a finite planet. Migration has always been a possible coping strategy for people facing economic and political problems as well as environmental changes. Continuing growth has not erased poverty and closed the gap between the rich and poor, which is a major driving force of migration. Only changing the structure of the system will do that. Practical implications: The present unsustainable way of life means that society risks a multitude of crises. Many breakdowns will most likely be happening simultaneously throughout the entire environmental and socioeconomic system on a worldwide scale. Humanity has set the scene for the overshoot scenario and reversal of growth will be necessary to get out of it. New kinds of methods are needed to respond to the current challenges. It is imperative to reinvent economic theories and create new monetary and fiscal policies to solve the multidimensional ecological, economic, demographic, political and social crises humanity is facing today. Originality/value: In a world where the lack of foresight exists to an alarming degree at every level of society, it is important to be constantly reminded of the imminent global crises resulting from growth. It is becoming apparent that fragmented strategies cannot address the pressing challenges. New values are needed to guide society to peaceful and equitable development in an increasingly interconnected world. This can only emerge from a new critical self-awareness and the will to act. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";"Climate change; Economic growth; Energy; Globalization; Migration; Population distribution; Population explosion; Poverty; Resource scarcity";"Heinonen, M.; Section of International Cooperation, Finnish Immigration Service, Helsinki, Finland; email: matti.heinonen@kolumbus.fi";;10748121;;;;English;Horizon;2-s2.0-84883116698;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In keeping with the practice approach to strategic foresight, we delineate strategic foresight as a continuous and contextual practice of 'wayfinding', that manifest in everyday situated organizing. We offer an integrating framework that contributes to the ongoing discussions about alternative approaches to theorizing strategic foresight. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;;"Sarpong, D.; Bristol Business School, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom; email: David2.Sarpong@uwe.ac.uk";;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-84887021203;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Until very recently, the approaches used in these studies have remained relatively unchanged. However, the global forest sector has been faced with major structural changes and its operating environment has become ever more complex and interlinked with other sectors. The aim of this article is to review the forest sector outlook approaches in face of these changes, and to analyze how well they have been able to capture and project the changes. Moreover, we raise the question of whether they seem informative enough for the purposes of today's decision makers and other stakeholders. The results indicate that the existing outlook studies have not been able to sufficiently capture the structural changes in global paper markets, and it may be that they have difficulties in considering the possible structural changes in other markets as well. In order to assess the changes occurring in the operating environment more systematically, and to better meet the needs of policy-makers and stakeholders, there are potential advantages in complementing the current modeling approach dominant in the forest sector with other methods from the field of foresight. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;"Foresight; Forest products markets; Modeling; Outlook; Paper products; Structural change";"Hurmekoski, E.; European Forest Institute (EFI), Foresight and Policy Support Programme, Torikatu 34, 80100 Joensuu, Finland; email: elias.hurmekoski@efi.int";;13899341;;FPEOA;;English;For.

This is an opinion piece. The cost of basic knowledge assets, with the rise of “big data” and the internet, are asymptotically approaching zero, questioning why the increasing demand for access cannot be met at lower cost at the gates of the “Ivory Tower”. This is and will continue to have increased impact on how basic baccalaureate knowledge is delivered and certified The “bar” for job entrance has been raised beyond the secondary school diploma. At the same time, the removal of bottlenecks for post-secondary certification, internationally, will change the nature of employment of graduates and also the entire infrastructure of the bachelor-level institutional programs.

It follows the CST-100 parachute system development for the Commercial Crew Development II (CCDev II) phase of work. During this development phase Airborne Systems worked with Boeing to adopt only the best of the many program management practices and procedures that are used for government customers. A small dedicated team was formed to provide continuity throughout the project and thus optimize the overall effort. Risk was minimized or avoided altogether by benefitting from the vast knowledge of past and ongoing government programs. This experience helped forecast potential system enhancements such as integration and installation foresight, simplified routing and parachute components, and additional system flexibility. Moreover, by adopting AS heritage systems and parachute planforms to fit the CST-100 recovery requirements, critical time was redirected on design maturation and simplification in order to provide a highly effective, yet lean system. This led to the initial system development, marked by two highly successful development parachute drop tests, thus paving the road ahead for further qualification of the CST-100 parachute system. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Unfortunately, currently there is no guidance about which neighborhood indicators forecast future neighborhood changes. This study seeks a neighborhood early warning indicator that is readily available, frequently updated, and that predicts with substantial foresight and accuracy future changes in key aspects of neighborhood market processes and quality of life. We search over a range of neighborhood indicators for one or more that clearly lead others in a temporal sense, instead of lagging behind them. We employ Granger causality tests with indicators related to public safety, housing market, and economic activity that are based on data from Chicago neighborhoods between 1998 and 2009. Our key finding is that only one indicator analyzed, completed home foreclosures, systematically precedes other neighborhood indicators but does not systematically follow after them. All other indicators are enmeshed in complicated, often mutually causal temporal patterns, which render them inappropriate for forecasting. We conclude that completed home foreclosures is an appropriate early warning indicator of neighborhood decline in several dimensions. Takeaway for practice: Planners interested in identifying imminently emerging problems in their constituents neighborhoods should regularly acquire and map data on home foreclosures as soon as they become available, and then undertake compensatory actions as quickly as feasible. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;"foreclosures; Granger causality; neighborhood decline; neighborhood indicators";;Routledge;1944363;;;;English;J.

The main problems of other modelling languages for firm interactions that MOBENA tries to overcome are that (1) the methodologies tailored for BEs are very few, the others neglect interdependences or focus only on tangible or intangible aspects, and (2) they limit potential for strategic analysis and they do not take in a future-perspective. The paper includes an analysis of literature on Strategic Management (in particular, strategic models on relationships), Network Analysis and Foresight, from whence the theoretical proposal of the MOBENA is born. Then, the authors illustrate its application via a case study conducted inside the Telecom Italia Future Centre, and in particular taking as example the digital imaging ecosystem.

Even though it is not explicit in many projects, we especially value research that is still relevant five, ten or more years after it is completed. However, published research in the field of interactive computing (and technology research in general) often lacks evidence of systematic thinking about the long-term impacts of current trends. For example, trends on an exponential curve change much more rapidly than intuition predicts. As a result, research may accidentally emphasize nearterm thinking. When thinking about the future is approached systematically, we can critically examine multiple potential futures, expand the set of externalities under consideration, and address both negative and positive forecasts of the future. The field of Futures Studies provides methods that can support analysis of long-term trends, support the identification of new research areas and guide design and evaluation. We survey methods for futuristic thinking and discuss their relationship to Human Computer Interaction. Using the sustainability domain an example, we present a case study of a Futures Studies approach-the Delphi Method. We show how Futures Studies can be incorporated into Human Computer Interaction and highlight future work such as rethinking the role of externalities in the validation process.

We demonstrate that wind uncertainty can impose substantive costs on the system and that demand response can eliminate more than 75% of these costs if loads respond to system conditions immediately.

We discuss foresight as a system of inquiry into decision-making problems characterized by three key features - distancing, holism, and participation-intensiveness. We put forward the hypothesis that participative approaches to normative scenario development, which are structurally similar to a Rawlsian ""original position"" setup, generate a concern with the procedural arrangements governing the future world in the scenario, rather than simply with the events or states in the story of the future. This concern with ""constitutional basics"" may be regarded as an expression of participants' attempt to ensure that, in the future world, each party will have a seat at the table and a voice in the conversation. As a result, the construction of normative narratives may be interpreted in terms of an effort to smooth out tensions that are inevitably embedded in scenarios.

Consistent with the classical rational choice paradigm, our theory requires that endogenous expectations be replaced with a general-measurable function of the observable states of the model, to be determined optimally. This forecasting function is derived as the regime-independent feedback control minimizing the mean-square deviation of the equilibrium path from the corresponding perfect-foresight state motion (the reference model). We show that model reference adaptive expectations always generate a rational expectations equilibrium, irrespective of the presence of nonlinearities and/or imperfect information. Under equilibrium indeterminacy, this forecasting mechanism enforces the unique mean-square stable solution producing nearly perfect-foresight dynamics. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;"Dynamic programming; Markov-switching dynamic systems; Rational expectations; Time-varying Kalman filter";"Sorge, M.M.; University of Napoli Federico II, CSEF, Via Cinthia C.U.

We suggest that this mystique-the way some managers are perceived by observers-arises from the intuitive logic that psychologists and anthropologists call magical thinking. Consistent with this account, Study 1 found that perceptions of a manager's mystique are associated with judgments of his or her charismatic vision and ability to forecast future business trends. The authors hypothesized that mystique arises especially when success is observed in the absence of mechanical causes, such as long hours or hard-won skills. In Study 2, managers who succeeded mysteriously rather than mechanically evoked participants' attributions of foresight and their expectations of success at visionary tasks yet not at administrative tasks. The authors further hypothesized that as mystique is assumed to spread through contagion, observers desire physical contact with managers who are attributed mystique and with these managers' possessions. Study 3 found that managers described as visionary as opposed to diligent are judged to be charismatic and ultimately magnetic. The authors discuss the implications of these judgment patterns for the literatures on perception biases and impression management in organizations. © The Author(s) 2011.;"attribution; contagion; mystique; vision";"Young, M.

Their collaboration reveals how the shared identification of uncertainty as a major problem, their similar interpretation of rationality as the ability to select and use relevant information, and their embrace of certain methodological norms for the construction of economic theory (that it should be empirically grounded and mathematically sophisticated) enabled productive cross-fertilization between the two approaches in their nascent forms. In the beginning Modigliani's forward-looking procedure (with its focus on foresight) and Simon's backward-looking model (with its focus on learning) were conceived as complementary rather than antithetical for the development of a concrete decision rule under the hypothesis of incomplete information. The article also discusses Modigliani's and Emile Grunberg's contribution to rational expectations, concentrating on the paper they wrote but never published, and Modigliani's early reaction to John Muth's rational expectations theory. © 2013 by Duke University Press.;;"Rancan, A.; University of Molise, Department of Economics and Social Sciences, via F. de Sanctis, 86100 Campobasso, Italy; email: antonella.rancan@unimol.it";;182702;;;;English;Hist.

Experiences from a foresight project exploring future innovation patterns (www.innovation-futures.org) are discussed. Four specific features were applied in order to underpin the recognition of structural transformation:.Inductive foresight approach with an emphasis on capturing indications for extra-systemic change at a micro level instead of extrapolating seemingly dominant macro-trends. Visual inspiration, to mobilise tacit knowledge, support a creative spirit and an easy exchange of ideas among people with different disciplinary backgrounds. Rigorous assessment of coverage of dimensions of change, to foster the explicit consideration of possibly unrecognised/hidden structural changes. Extended openness for diversity, to avoid the exclusive interpretation of weak signals only in the context of the existing structures. The findings of the project indicate interesting changes in the nexus of innovation demand and innovation supply. A wide variety of hybrid value creation models with novel configurations of innovation actors emerged. We explain the approach and findings of the project and discuss in particular the implications for foresight methodology. We argue that all four innovative methodological features contributed in a specific way to opening up new perspectives on the future of innovation and potential structural transformation of innovation processes. © 2012.;"Foresight methodology; Inductive approach; Innovation pattern; Scenarios; Structural transformation; Vision; Visualisation; Weak signals";"Schirrmeister, E.; Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, Karlsruhe, Germany; email: Elna.Schirrmeister@isi.fraunhofer.de";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

New tendencies include a heightened search for breakthrough science and a focus on grand societal challenges. By their nature boundary-spanning, these make it less easy to locate FTA institutionally to achieve the necessary cross-cutting perspective. New institutions, methods and combinations of methods are noted.

It has been developed mainly for model-based decision support. This paper investigates the extent to which EMA is a promising approach for future oriented technology analysis (FTA). We report on three applications of EMA, using different modeling approaches, in three different technical domains. In the first case, EMA is combined with System Dynamics (SD) to study plausible dynamics for mineral and metal scarcity. The main purpose of this combination of EMA and SD is to gain insight into what kinds of surprising dynamics can occur given a variety of uncertainties and a basic understanding of the system. In the second case, EMA is combined with a hybrid model for airport performance calculations to develop an adaptive strategic plan. This case shows how one can iteratively improve a strategic plan through the identification of plausible external conditions that would cause the plan to perform poorly. In the final case, EMA is combined with an agent-based model to study transition dynamics in the electricity sector and identify crucial factors that positively and negatively affect a transition towards more sustainable functioning of the electricity sector. This paper concludes that EMA is useful for generating foresights and studying systemic and structural transformations despite the presence of a plethora of uncertainties, and for designing robust policies and plans, which are key activities of FTA. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;"Adaptive policymaking; Agent-based modeling; Deep uncertainty; Exploratory Modeling and Analysis; Future-oriented technology analysis; System dynamics";"Kwakkel, J.H.; Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, Delft University of Technology, 2600 GA, Delft, Netherlands; email: j.h.kwakkel@tudelft.nl";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The workshop elicited several scenarios describing stakeholder perceived notions of how offshore aquaculture could impact their industry. This joint method is a new method of developing future scenarios. These can in turn be used to develop more encompassing and interdisciplinary foresight models, early warning systems, for managers in different management areas.

Three main categories of environmental shock are identified; extreme events, abrupt swings, and tipping points. The factors determining the predictability of different shocks and hence the prospects for early warning are outlined. Lessons from existing early warning systems for extreme events and abrupt climate swings are summarised. Then the potential for early warning of bifurcation-type tipping points is explained, and contrasted with the lack of warning when stochastic internal variability triggers a shift in the state of a system. The scientific and technological progress needed to improve early warning capability is outlined. Then the framework is applied to the Foresight project on Migration and Global Environmental Change, with its focal eco-regions of drylands, low-elevation coastal zones, and mountainous regions.

In the US, FTA has been used to create visionary concepts and to promote cooperation between and among agencies, departments of the federal government, academia, and stakeholders. In Germany FTA has mainly been used to shape and define research and innovation agendas of established science-industry networks. The aim of the paper is to show what problems/challenges with regard to the innovation system have been addressed and what main actors have been involved, from the first monitoring and forecasting studies on nanotechnology to the establishment of national nanotechnology programs and continuing on until today. The paper offers a comparative analysis of the use and role of FTA where the focus is not on individual activities, but rather on the longer-term interplay between the organizational settings in both countries and the future-oriented nanotechnology analysis. In countries such as the US and Germany, where FTA on nanotechnology were already underway in the late 1980s, the early stages of FTA relied on expert-based methods such as technology intelligence and technology forecasting to define the field and to explore what could happen in general. Participatory formats such as dialogues on ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA) became more important only later on. Especially the inter-organizational setting can be considered a crucial condition for maximizing the impact that participatory FTA can have in the future governance of nanotechnology. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;"Emerging technologies; Foresight; Governance; Key enabling technologies; Nanotechnology; Public engagement; Responsible research and innovation; Technology assessment";"Schaper-Rinkel, P.; AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Donau-City-Straße 1, A-1220 Vienna, Austria; email: Petra.Schaper-Rinkel@ait.ac.at";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The objective of this paper is to develop an integrative method for systematically clustering, analyzing and visualizing the path for technology development and transformation. Design/methodology/approach: Delphi topics related to sustainable energy were collected from strategic foresight reports of Japan, South Korea and China, and used as sources for future technology themes analysis. A standard mapping taxonomy based on international patent classification system was used to map out the technology concept described in these future technology themes. Technology interactions can be identified through a causal effect analysis during the mapping, and the results among selected countries are cross-compared and visualized in an aggregated view. Findings: By this standard mapping taxonomy and structured analysis, future technology themes in strategic foresight reports from countries in focus are systematically mapped and integrated for viewing future technology options and interactions. Similarities and discrepancies for prospecting the future technology trajectory among these countries are also identified. Research limitations/implications: It would be a significant contribution if this structured analysis could be applied more broadly across different geographic regions or across research areas in foresight reports. This research may help to solve the practical difficulties faced during the secondary analysis of foresight studies in foresight preparatory studies by providing a consistent classification framework to make comparison and aggregation of future technology options from different countries/regions. Also, this classification framework can provide a bridge for linking with current technology performance such as patent productivity or quality and help in identifying the gaps between the probable future changes in S&T and the current capability. Originality/value: The integrative method in this research provides a way to combine both the advantage of strategic technology foresight and competitive technology intelligence by utilizing the results deriving from the former as targets for analysis and the analytic practice deriving from the latter to identify the possible competitive or cooperative landscapes in the future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Competitive technology intelligence; Delphi topic analysis; Forward planning; Innovation; International patent classification system; Strategic technology foresight; Sustainable energy";"Lin, H.-C.; Trend Analysis Division, Science and Technology Policy Research and Information Center (STPI), National Applied Research Laboratories (NARL), TaipeiTaiwan; email: hclin@stpi.narl.org.tw";;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-84874172735;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They are The Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States and The United States Commission into 21st Century Terrorism and National Security Report. Stemming from our analysis of how these commissions make sense of the risk posed by terrorism to national security, we seek to make three contributions. First, we develop sensemaking/sensegiving concepts in public commission reporting by theorizing about hindsight-foresight temporal dynamics. In particular, we extend existing sensemaking scholarship on public commission reporting by directing attention towards the important, yet under-scrutinized role that these inquiries have in sensemaking about the future. Second, we extend the presuppositions underpinning sensemaking theory by operationalizing concepts of antenarrative and employing them in our comparative analysis of the two reports. Third, we contribute to practice by illustrating empirically some of the 'tactics' that can be used for challenging hindsight about the known past for the purpose of improving foresight about an unknown future. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight; Hindsight; Public commission; Sensegiving; Sensemaking; Terrorism";"MacKay, R.B.; University of Edinburgh, Business School, 29 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH8 9JS, United Kingdom; email: Brad.MacKay@ed.ac.uk";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In this study, the author presents a hybrid method of assessing patent value and determining strategy in the early stage of commercialization. The author uses empirical data from Yuan Ze University to test the method. As a result of his analysis, the author categorized patents into four groups according to benefits and risk factors extracted from a factor analysis, and for each group of patents the author offers possible strategies for further commercialization. The method, which uses fuzzy measurement to pinpoint the location of a patent in a matrix with great precision, is more accurate than traditional technology portfolio planning models that rely on Likert scales. The method can highlight change in the meaning and strategic grouping of a patent. Furthermore, it can be used for long-term strategic planning, such as strategic foresight and corporate foresight. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.;"Commercialization strategies; Delphi method; Fuzzy measurement; Patent value assessment; Strategic foresight; Technology portfolio planning (TPP)";"Hsieh, C.-H.; College of Management, Yuan Ze University, No. 135 Yuan-Tung Road, Chung-Li, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan; email: john@saturn.yzu.edu.tw";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

However, the dynamics of ICT development depends on the global challenges and broader trends that define long-term S&T priorities. What factors that will influence the future of the ICT industry? What technological solutions will determine its characteristics in the next 15-20 years? These and similar questions were considered by the HSE ISSEK specialists in co-operation with the colleagues from other research entities while investigating trends in S&T at the global and national levels. The experts have analyzed socio-economic and S&T challenges affecting the ICT sector, advanced R&D fields, markets for innovative products and services, estimated the «windows of opportunities» for Russia. As a result, the strategic directions of blueprint research which ensure the basis for the creation of innovative products and new markets for the medium- and long-term (beyond 2020) perspective. Foresight results have been validated by the representatives of leading companies, research centers, universities and international organizations. Among the solutions expected in the period up to 2030 are the prototypes of systems implementing the new computing principles and multi-language software for extraction and formalization of knowledge, technologies dealing with «big data», new analytical tools (personal analytic systems, means of the real time data processing, mobile analytics, etc.). Markets for novel technology solutions are expected to be rapidly growing in healthcare, energy, engineering and transport, as well as in personal usage of ICT products and services. The study allows to conclude that in the medium to long term, the ICT sector will retain a high growth dynamic and will have transformative impact on virtually all areas of human life. The life cycle of technologies, related products and services will shorten. In this context, R&D development plays a crucial role for keeping up with competitors. Russian science has a certain potential in much of the considered areas, although one can hardly perceive Russia as gaining global leadership. A breakthrough level of research is observed, for example, in telecommunication technologies (communication, networking and content distribution).;"Global challenges; Information and communication technologies; Long-term foresight; Priorities; S&T capacities; Trends";;National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics;1995459X;;;;Russian;Foresight Russ.;2-s2.0-84884504666;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Different from previous studies in which players update their strategies according to the imitation rule, in this article, the strategies are updated with limited foresight. We find that two absorbing states-full cooperation and full defection-can be reached, assuming that players can delete interaction relations unilaterally, but new relations can only be created with the mutual consent of both partners. Simulation experiments show that high levels of cooperation in large populations can be achieved when the temptation to defect in PDG is low. Moreover, we explore the factors which influence the level of cooperation.

Acting upon such priorities requires coordinated efforts from key actors throughout the life cycle of nanoproducts from development to commercialization, not just in the research phase.

Many futurists are developing foresight of future technologies based on Delphi studies, unfolding history, brainstorming, expert surveys, trend analysis, data mining, and so on. However, formalizing these processes is still a necessary task. In this paper, we introduce the NEST (New and Emerging Signals of Trends) model developed by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI). The NEST collects information from worldwide expert networks and detects the weak signals of emerging future trends systematically, based on massive data analysis, inference techniques, and Delphi studies, to support the development of foresight of future research and technology. The NEST model combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. In the quantitative approach stages, NEST uses clustering, pattern recognition, and cross-impact analysis using a Bayesian network. In the stages of qualitative approaches, NEST conducts environmental scanning, brainstorming, and a Delphi study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;"Bayesian network; Delphi study; Emerging trend; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative analysis; Weak signal";"Hong, S.-W.; Technology Opportunity Discovery Lab., Department of Information Analysis, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, 66 Hoegi-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-741, South Korea; email: shong@kisti.re.kr";Elsevier Ltd;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-84885389727;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Along with the decrease of TB people's attentions to tuberculosis has been reducing significantly, including the medical personnel. In the 1990s, TB returned to increase again, then Emergency Declaration against TB by Minister of Health and Welfare in 1999 drew the public attentions to TB again. Unfortunately, however, there have been many hospitals that cannot deal with TB properly. On the other hand, non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis (NTM) is increasing recently, which bothers many physicians or pulmonologists. ""Japanese Respiratory Society"" (JRS) was founded as ""Japan Society of Chest Diseases"" derived from ""Japanese Society for Tuberculosis"" (JSTB) in 1961, when almost all the members were the members of both the Societies. Now, after 50 years of JRS foundation, only one in four members of JRS may join to JSTB. However, the needs for training opportunities about TB and NTM do exist indeed, which is suggested by the fact that ""Tuberculosis course"", the joint program with JSTB, held in every annual JRS meeting has been filled with a lot of standing audience. In order to support these needs for training about TB, JSTB began the Certification System for TB and NTM in 2011. More than 1,000 certified physicians were born so far. In addition, the decreased number of JSTB members has returned to increase significantly. The most important challenge is to make a future countermeasure against TB and NTM, and also to promote the development of human resources based on the current situation and forecast of TB. This symposium was planned along the theme of this congress, ""TB control for the next generation"" in response to the wishes of the Congress President Dr. Yamagishi. On behalf of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Dr. Yoshizawa talked about the future measures and challenges, and the human resource development for the future, based on the current situation of the medical system for tuberculosis. Dr. Fujita, the chairman of the committee of the certification system, talked about the JSTB Certification System, and the prospect of the human resource development. Dr. Nagai talked about the training opportunities for TB and NTM such as the ""Educational seminar"" in the annual meeting of JSTB or the ""Tuberculosis course"" in the annual meeting of JRS. Nurse and the Public health nurse are also the important members of the medical team for TB. Ms. Nagata talked about the human resources development of nurse responsible for tuberculosis care. Finally, Dr. Kudo, who originally proposed the JSTB Certification System as the chairman of the future planning committee, addressed the history and the foresights of the near future medical care system for TB as a special remark. We wish all the members may share the prospects of future medical care for TB and NTM, which may help for improving the future medical system.";;Watanabe, A.email: akiwa@idac.tohoku.ac.jp;;229776;;;24551952;Japanese;Kekkaku;2-s2.0-84897572680;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mapping allows codifying and analyzing a bulk of FLA experiences gained worldwide. This in turn will contribute to enhancing performance of such activities and therefore of STI policy as a whole. The paper provides rationales for Futures Studies mapping, considers related opportunities and challenges, reviews lessons learned from early mapping efforts. It focuses on the large-scale EU-funded mapping project ""European Foresight Platform"" (EFP). Using this project as illustration, the paper describes mapping routines, the selected indicators of mapped Foresight initiatives, including their objectives, participants, target groups, methodologies, outcomes and recommendations.

However, major national foresight programmes that have a 4-5. year cycle have encountered many challenges. These challenges include prolonged planning time, resulting in not keeping pace with the ever-changing environment, massive resource investment unsuitable for countries with limited resources, and bottlenecks such as inoperability of the planning processes connected to follow-up project promotion. In this article, we propose a dynamic modular design perspective to overcome such difficulties and demonstrate the process and achievements of foresight planning using the Taiwan Industry and Advanced Technology Research Project as an example.

Design/methodology/approach: The essay combines a general review of the topic with an overview of a range of horizon-scanning approaches that are in use in the UK health system. Findings: Different approaches - shorter as well as longer-term, searching as well as broad scanning - are appropriate in different circumstances. In times of systemic change it is necessary to combine approaches of all types. Research limitations/implications: Only a small sample of the huge range of horizon-scanning exercises has been studied, and the essay has not gone far into the question of how horizon-scanning relates to other elements of the foresight process. Practical implications: The implication is that horizon-scanning should be undertaken on a routine basis, and should be integrated into planning activities from the start. Social implications: Horizon-scanning is a tool needed in activities such as planning for the workforce, and for health and safety issues.

It serves as the primary means by which Americans get their political information. Likewise, it develops their sense of how politics and politicians operate in our democracy. This paper examines how enhanced television technologies might be applied to political programming, as well as the effects such changes might have on the future of participatory democracy. Following a series of conjectures regarding the future application of enhanced television technologies to politics, the potential benefits and drawbacks of interactive television on governance are discussed. Using the social shaping approach to technology foresight, it is demonstrated that forecasts of technology and governance are ultimately dependent upon the normative assumptions of the investigator. © 2012.;;"Waite, B.C.; Political Science and Emerging Media Faculty, Ball State University, 2000 University Ave., North Quad 269, Muncie, IN 47306-0002, United States; email: bcwaite@bsu.edu";;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-84867991335;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, a two-stage technology foresight approach is proposed. During the first stage, critical technologies are identified and evaluated by nationwide experts through Delphi surveys. In the second stage, a system dynamics simulation model is used to estimate how critical parameter values are likely to impact the attainment of foresight goals. A detailed illustration of this two-stage process is provided by a technology foresight case study in the Chinese information and communication technologies (ICT) industry. Because it was identified by the first-stage Delphi method as a critical technology, the diffusion of 4th generation wireless telecommunication technology (4G) was simulated, and experimentation was conducted.

In particular, traders with limited information perform below market average and are outperformed by random traders; only insiders beat the market. However, this result has only been shown in markets with a few traders and a uniform distribution over information levels. We present additional simulations of several more realistic information distributions, extending previous findings. In addition, we analyze the market dynamics with an evolutionary model of competing information levels. Results show that the highest information level will dominate if information comes for free.

Design/methodology/approach: This is not an analysis of the particular content of the next 500 or 1,000 years but a comparative analysis of methodologies and epistemological approaches best utilized in long-range foresight work. It involves an analysis of multiple methods to understand long-range foresight; literature review; and critical theory. Findings: Methodologies that forecast the long-term future are likely to be more rewarding - in terms of quality, insight, and validity - if they are eclectic and layered, go back in time as far as they go in the future, that contextualize critical factors and long-term projections through a nuanced reading of macrohistory, and focus on epistemic change, the ruptures that reorder how we know the world. Research limitations/implications: The article provides frameworks to study the long-range future. It gives advice on how best to design research projects that are focused on the long-term. Limitations include: no quantitative studies were used and the approach while epistemologically sensitive remains bounded by Western frameworks of knowledge. Practical implications: The article provides methodological and epistemological guidance as to the best methods for long range foresight. It overviews strengths and weaknesses of various approaches.

After summarising their main points it seeks to consider different approaches to ""sense making"" in the work of future-relevant theorists and practitioners; then to consider the case of sense making through integral approaches and then to explore implications through several themes. These include: a view of changes in the global system, generic responses to the global emergency, the critique of regressive modernity and how responses to ""Cassandra's dilemma"" (to know the future but not be believed) might stand in relation to the views of both authors. The paper aims to conclude with a view of the benefits to be obtained from the use of a four-quadrant approach to understanding and responding to the human predicament. Design/methodology/approach: This is a discussion paper that questions some of the views and assumptions of the earlier papers and explores some implications of an alternative view. Findings: While supporting the drive to improve upon the theoretical foundations of futures studies and foresight, the paper questions whether such developments are as central, or will be as influential, as the authors suggest. A different view of ""how to approach the future"" is recommended, in part through four ""domains of generic responses"" to the global predicament. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents an argument supported by evidence. Both should be reviewed by others in pursuit of extending the conversation beyond philosophical questions to implications in practice. Practical implications: The essence of a methodology to understand, approach and even to resolve many aspects of the global emergency is outlined here. As such the paper has many practical implications for the way that futures and foresight professionals operate and towards what ends. Social implications: The paper provides a substantive basis for qualified hope and engagement with a range of future-shaping tasks. Specifically, these relate to the necessary shifts from ""overshoot and collapse"" trajectories to options for ""moderated descent"". Originality/value: Much of the work carried out on the perspective and issues discussed here has been carried out by those working outside of the futures/foresight domain. The value is both in affirming positive ways forward and extending the professional reach of futures/foresight workers to embrace new ideas and methods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";"Critique; Forecasting; Forward planning; Generic responses; Global emergency; Global system; Human development; Regressive modernity; Sense making";"Slaughter, R.

More precisely, based on the knowledge of actual production of the competitor and its actual rate of change, the clever firm is able to evaluate its opponent's output in the near future by virtue of straightforward extrapolative foresight. We finally arrive at a conclusion that this seemingly rational mechanism takes a positive effect on convergence to equilibrium behavior. Inconsistent with common intuition, we demonstrate that stronger foresight ability is not always better to stabilize the equilibrium. Particularly, perfect foresight dose not give rise to the best stabilizing factor. © 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the long history of services management delivered by Rolls-Royce, RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety) has remained a key principle for service delivery and we have worked to evolve a services infrastructure tailored to deliver both the responsiveness and foresight demanded by today's customers. Contracts for Rolls-Royce services like TotalCare, CorporateCare and MissionCare are essentially performance based contracts for in-service systems delivered through the theory of know, predict, control. Where know, involves understanding the current fleet status and maintaining the data management structure required to respond to that status. Predict, involves forecasting the future fleet status and proactively identifying future potential threats and opportunities. Finally, control, involves the actual management of the future fleet status with a team focused on both tactical and strategic objectives. This three-core theory is directly supported by a three-core organizational infrastructure based around data, business, and fleet-support management which in turn drive customer satisfaction and deliver on customer commitments. Hence, this paper will elaborate on this theory of know, predict, control, relate it to the Rolls-Royce Services organizational infrastructure, and explain how a RAMS-centric forecast capability is leveraged as the decision-support heart of services management using the method of forecast, analyze, validate, optimize, and recommend.

Industrial energy demands, Kyoto agreement and carbon trade are shown as probable causes. Currently, Turkey has a total installed capacity of about 48.5GW for electricity from all energy sources. High energy prices and unstable suppliers have stimulated Turkey's growing interest in wind business and wind power. This paper analyzes Turkey's wind energy future perspective and power generation strategy with a view to explaining Delphi approach to wind energy development. In this study, the two-round Delphi survey was conducted by experts to determine and measure the expectations of the sector representatives through online surveys where a total of 70 experts responded from 24 different locations. The majority of the Delphi survey respondents were from 23 different universities (60%), electricity generation industries (21%), two different governmental organizations (11%), nongovernmental organizations (6%) and other institutions (2%). The article discusses not only the expert sights on wind energy technology but also all bibliometrical approaches. The results showed that Turkey's wind power installed capacity is expected to exceed 40GW by the end of the 2020s and in the middle of the 2030s, and Turkey would be the European leading country in the field of electricity generation from the wind. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;"Delphi survey; Lead markets; Market penetration; Technology foresight; Wind energy";"Celiktas, M.S.; EBILTEM, Ege University Science and Technology Research Center, Izmir, Turkey; email: soner.celiktas@ege.edu.tr";;0363907X;;IJERD;;English;Int.

Consequently, environmental technologies are regarded as one of the fastest growing global markets. Owing to the wide range of technologies available that can contribute to progress in this field, there is a high demand for prospective research setting priorities in a transparent way. Against this background, the presented study aimed at supporting the process of identifying and recommending options for the prioritisation of future research funding. Taking Germany as an example, this was done by analysing chances and perspectives of different environmental technologies as well as courses of action in combination with the aim of reaching new markets for seven environmental fields of action: Climate protection, air pollution control, water management, soil conservation, protection of scarce resources, waste management and biodiversity. As a key-element of the study, future environmental challenges and promising future technological developments were identified by an extensive literature review and internet research, followed by a large-scale expert survey and several topic-specific workshops. Results demonstrate that one focus of future funding should be put on technology development for meeting the demands of emerging and developing countries. Thus, an appropriate response for the German environmental industry to such global challenges requires the provision of exportable environmental technologies, although this will change the requirement profiles of the technologies. Many high-tech-products, developed for the European market, are not directly applicable or invaluable for emerging and developing countries. The study also recommends that funding should not concentrate on individual technologies, but rather on holistic views of technologies, processes, material and energy flows. Furthermore, the estimations of market potential for the investigated technologies are closely connected to the ecological problems and their social perception in different countries. Basis strategies should be developed, which take into account the technical development as well as the main drivers and constrains. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic behavior is determined essentially by two types of entities: on one hand, the degree of information stickiness that characterizes the price-setting decisions of firms and the consumption and labor supply decisions of households and, on the other hand, a policy parameter that indicates how the central bank acts in order to stabilize prices. Under perfect foresight, stability will hold and the degree of information stickiness simply indicates the velocity of convergence towards the steady-state. If the ability to forecast future events is less than perfect, stability will then depend on monetary policy-the main result is that the stickier the diffusion of information is, the more aggressive monetary policy must be in order to guarantee convergence towards the long-term steady-state. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;"Expectations; Perfect foresight; Stability; Sticky-information; Transitional dynamics";"Gomes, O.; Instituto Superior de Contabilidade e Administração de Lisboa (ISCAL/IPL), Av.

The following theories and associated theoretical frameworks are discussed in the article: (1) Environmental Scanning Model, (2) Nonaka's Knowledge Management Theory, (3) Gammelgaard's and Ritter's Knowledge Retrieval Matrix, (4) Boisot's Information Space Model and (5) Vejlgaard's Diamond Shaped Trend Model. These various and nevertheless complementary perspectives are important for the further development of weak signal analysis, knowledge management theory and knowledge management practices in modern organisations as well as for anticipation and decision-making in policy-making arenas. There are still many theoretical and empirical challenges in these fields of scientific knowledge. A general conclusion is that all these frameworks provide interesting new perspectives for modern futures studies as such. Another conclusion is that there are various knowledge management (KM) and scanning frameworks available for implementing weak signal analysis. However, this paper, its observations and conclusions also imply that a more generalised approach to weak signal analysis needs to be developed and that modern KM theories should be used when developing new futures studies/foresight methodologies. According to the theoretical guidelines presented in this article, it is possible to make the suggestion that it would be wise to integrate the latest developments in weak signal analysis into knowledge management theory and vice versa. © 2011.;;"Kaivo-oja, J.; Finland Futures Research Centre, University of Turku, Tykistökatu 4 D, ElectroCity, FIN 20520 Turku, Finland; email: jari.kaivo-oja@tse.fi";;163287;;;;English;Futures;2-s2.0-84857658959;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Important aspects of the agency's mandate include collection, acquisition, analysis, and reporting and dissemination of data on research and development trends, on U.S. competitiveness in science, technology, and research and development, and on the condition and progress of U.S. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Improving Measures of Science, Technology and Innovation: Interim Report examines the status of the NCSES's science, technology, and innovation (STI) indicators. This report assesses and provides recommendations regarding the need for revised, refocused, and newly developed indicators designed to better reflect fundamental and rapid changes that are reshaping global science, technology and innovation systems. The book also determines the international scope of STI indicators and the need for developing new indicators that measure developments in innovative activities in the United States and abroad, and Offers foresight on the types of data, metrics and indicators that will be particularly influential in evidentiary policy decision-making for years to come. In carrying out its charge, the authoring panel undertook a broad and comprehensive review of STI indicators from different countries, including Japan, China, India and several countries in Europe, Latin America and Africa. Improving Measures of Science, Technology, and Innovation makes recommendations for near-term action by NCSES along two dimensions: (1) development of new policy-relevant indicators that are based on NCSES survey data or on data collections at other statistical agencies; and (2) exploration of new data extraction and management tools for generating statistics, using automated methods of harvesting unstructured or scientometric data and data derived from administrative records. © 2012 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Based on an in-depth and multiple study of several companies, we analyse the main characteristics of environmental uncertainty - complexity and dynamism - that shape companies' approaches to strategic foresight and uncertainty management. We explore the impact of growing complexity and dynamism on these approaches and the role of prediction and control in their design and implementation. We outline a conceptual framework for strategic foresight activities - and their relationships with decision making under uncertainty - as a planned learning process about the future which enables managers not to know opportunities and threats in advance, but to detect them more promptly and to react more effectively as soon as they start emerging. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;"Learning; Planning; Strategic decision making; Strategic foresight; Uncertainty";"Vecchiato, R.; Politecnico di Milano, Department of Management Economics and Industrial Engineering, P.zza Leonardo da Vinci, 32, 20133 Milano, Italy; email: riccardo.vecchiato@polimi.it";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Recognizing this need, the paper begins with the introduction of the Systemic Foresight Methodology (SFM) is introduced briefly as a conceptual framework to understand and appreciate the complexity of systems and interdependencies and interrelationships between their elements. Conducting Foresight systemically involves a set of 'systemic' thought experiments, which is about how systems (e.g. human and social systems, industrial/sectoral systems, and innovation systems) are understood, modelled and intervened for a successful change programme. A methodological approach is proposed with the use of network analysis to show an application of systemic thinking in Foresight through the visualisation of interrelationships and interdependencies between trends, issues and actors, and their interpretation to explain the evolution of systems. Network analysis is a powerful approach as it is able to analyse both the whole system of relations and parts of the system at the same time and hence it reveals the otherwise hidden structural properties of the systems. Our earlier work has attempted to incorporate network analysis in Foresight, which helped to reveal structural linkages of trends and identify emerging important trends in the future. Following from this work, in this paper we combine systemic Foresight, network analysis and scenario methods to propose an 'Evolutionary Scenario Approach,' which explains the ways in which the future may unfold based on the mapping of the gradual change and the dynamics of aspects or variables that characterise a series of circumstances in a period of time. Thus, not only are evolutionary scenarios capable of giving a snapshot of a particular future, but also explaining the emerging transformation pathways of events and situations from the present into the future as systemic narratives. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;"Big picture survey; Evolutionary scenarios; Network analysis; Scanning; Scenarios; Systemic Foresight";"Saritas, O.; Manchester Institute of Innovation Research (MIoIR), University of Manchester, Oxford Road, M13 9PL, Manchester, United Kingdom; email: Ozcan.Saritas@manchester.ac.uk";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

The specific kind of relation that is explored has similarities with the sticky-information Phillips curve of the Mankiw-Reis framework. Nevertheless, it adds an important dimension: firms need to form expectations about current events on past time periods not because of infrequent optimal updating of information but because producers want to evaluate the possibility of taking advantage of information deficiencies on the consumers' side. A positive probability of 'fooling' consumers with a price above the one imposed by market conditions re-shapes the dynamic relation between the inflation rate and the output gap. © 2011 University of Venice.;"Bounded rationality; Information acquisition; Monetary policy; Perfect foresight; Phillips curve; Stability analysis; Thought experimentation";"Gomes, O.; Instituto Superior de Contabilidade e Administração de Lisboa, ISCAL, Av.

The need to identify direct impacts, measure them and identify the factors that lead to impact is the primary objective of the special issue and, as outlined in the article, represents a critical addition to the foresight field. On the basis of case studies, experience, and theoreticalevaluative frameworks this issue seels to offer suggestions regarding the factors that may help policy makers, academics, consultants, and others involved in foresight produce impactful results. The methodology deployed for this article is both empirical and meta analysis. This introductory article is based on the special issue articles as well as the authors' extensive practical experiences in foresight. Foresight does impact policy. Case studies and experiences in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia identified in the special issue provide support for this. Also, as difficult as it is to measure impact, the authors explore several frameworks that will help the foresight community demonstrate impact and prove the value of foresight.

A key element of this Foresight is that S&T is now expected to indicate solutions for broad social issues and global issues (climate change, etc.) including those that address Japan's most urgent challenges (e.g. energy, aging population). This mission-oriented foresight is novel for the Japanese, since prior foresight exercises have been done with a technology focus. This paper aims to address how the new view of foresight - as more than mere technical potentials - has resulted in several types of foresight impacts, which are noted in the main text. Design/methodology/approach: The 9th Delphi Survey involved two types of interdisciplinary perspectives related to Japan's social future (Safe, Secure, Cooperation and Collaboration) and 12 S&T fields. The committees discussed what could emerge within 30 years and involved 26 domains of social expertise and 140 specialists. Findings: The 9th S&T Foresight investigation consists of an integration of three foresight methods - Delphi survey, scenario writing, and capability of local regions for green innovation - regarding sustainable development. Each method provides clear messages, and has unique impacts. Originality/value: Overall, a major foresight impact has been to enable a broader view of innovation to prevail in this ninth foresight, where social-scenario insights and more socially adaptive policies complement the traditional S&T focus developed by Delphi surveys 1-8. This shifted the policy discourse toward societal innovation from technical innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Delphi method; Delphi survey; Forecasting; Foresight; Japan; Scenario; Science and technology policy";"Urashima, K.; Green Innovation Unit, National Institute of Science and Technology Policy, Tokyo, Japan; email: urashima@nistep.go.jp";;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-84857578625;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On the basis of the extensive experience of the authors, this article seeks to offer suggestions regarding the factors that may help policy makers, academics, consultants, and others involved in FTA projects, to produce useful and meaningful contributions to decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology deployed for this article is empirical. It is based on the lessons extracted and evidence produced by the authors' hundreds of diverse global consulting engagements as well as their analytical work on the subject. Added together the authors of this paper have engaged in over 80 years of professional practice. The article summarizes the results of presentations given by the authors and the ensuing discussion that occurred at the conference: Futures Oriented Technology Analysis 2011, held at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) in Seville on 13 May. Findings: Impactful FTA starts with the selection of the appropriate methodologies and skills for the specific anticipatory task. Arguing on the basis of experience, the authors point out that the effective impact of FTA projects on decision-making depends on a strong grasp of the principles of foresight and project design, an educated client with clear expectations and a strong commitment, well-developed communication efforts throughout, and considerable managerial capacity both on the demand and supply sides of the process. Originality/value: By bringing the evidence of experience to bear, this article adds value to existing academic and practitioner discussions of the effectiveness of FTA for decision-making. The article provides an original vantage point on key questions being posed by both users and suppliers of forward-looking activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Anticipation; Critical success factors; Decision making; Foresight; Foresight impact; Forward-looking analysis";"Calof, J.; Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; email: calof@telfer.uottawa.ca";;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-84863282484;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Foresight has made a transition from thematic papers and policy briefs to a complex set of methods integrated in the framework of S&T and innovation policy making. Foresight also addresses broad social and economic issues along with conventional S&T problems. It focuses often on interdisciplinary fields and cross-sector problems. It has witnessed the introduction of such new methods as weak signals and wild cards, and it has benefitted from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Russian S&T foresight follows global trends. It has given support for revisions of the national S&T priorities and critical technologies. In 2007-2010, two cycles of the National S&T Foresight (initiated by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation) were completed. They resulted in the creation of frameworks and expert networks for future studies. Foresight culture has been finding deeper roots in Russia. The paper addresses mainly the key features of the third (ongoing) cycle of the national S&T Foresight (2011) against the background of the first two cycles and the international trends. This cycle represents a wider coverage of issues (macroeconomic scenarios, trends in basic research, S&T resources, future dem and for skills, and global drivers of S&T developments); more complicated methodologies (bibliometric analysis, expert panels, surveys, roadmapping, and quantitative models); and a combination of ""market pull"" and ""technology push"" approaches toward estimating future developments. This cycle is building a wider network of experts at new Foresight centres at various Russian research universities. It concludes with a discussion of some barriers still to be overcome in Foresight studies: integration of sectoral visions, deeper analyses of some scientific disciplines, stronger integration into policy making, and spreading among business and research communities.";"Critical technologies; Decision-making; Foresight; Long-term forecasting; National innovation system; Roadmapping; Russian long-term S&T foresight; S&T priorities";;National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics;1995459X;;;;Russian;Foresight Russ.;2-s2.0-84884504469;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Through this process, a consensus is reached about the direction of future technology development. However, we believe that bibliometric analysis can do more for technology policy formulation, such as (1) offer quantitative data as evidence to support the results of qualitative analysis; (2) review the situations of literature publication in specific technological fields to seize the current stage of technology development; and (3) help us grasp the relative advantage of foresight issues development in Taiwan and the world and develop profound strategic planning in accordance with the concept of Revealed Comparative Advantage. For those reasons, our research will revisit the role that bibliometric analysis plays for nations while choosing the foresight issues. In addition, we will analyze the development of the technology policy in Taiwan based on bibliometric analysis, and complete the foresight issues selection by processing key issue integration, key word collection related to this field, the searching and confirmation of literature, development opportunities exploration, comparative development advantage analysis and the innovation-foresight matrix construction, etc. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.";"Agricultural technology; Bibliometric analysis; Research strategies; Revealed comparative advantage (RCA); S-curve; Technology foresight";"Liaw, Y.-C.; Department of Business Management, Ming Chi University of Technology, No. 84, Gongzhuan Rd., Taishan Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan; email: ycliaw@mail.mcut.edu.tw";Kluwer Academic Publishers;1389130;;;;English;Scientometrics;2-s2.0-84869213288;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To assess the probabilities the experts' opinions on the expected time of implementation on the industrial scale of the considered technologies were used. The experts' opinions were obtained by Delphi analysis within the energy foresight carried out by Central Mining Institute in Katowice (Poland). Due to the fact that the results reached are equivocal (they are burdened with a high level of a subjective view of experts) and imprecise, instead of using classical methods of classification, the fussy sets theory is used. The following sets were defined: high, moderate and low probabilities of technology implementation. The results of the carried analysis show that the highest probabilities of implementation (from the point of view of the expected time of implementation) are of those technologies which base on fossil fuels (coal preparation, oil and gas industry) and management of burning by-products.;"Foresight; Fuzzy sets; Modern energy technologies";"Wojciak, M.; University of Economics in KatowicePoland; email: mwojciak@ue.katowice.pl";International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA;;;;;English;Inniv.

These difficulties are exacerbated when, for example, for the long-term development scenarios, the design of entire sets of forecasts' trajectories is required and they have to reach numerous time horizons. Such a problem occurred during the implementation of the energy foresight for Poland, which required the construction of renewable energy production forecasts for the years 2010-2050. Possible solutions to this problem are the main aspects of this article. The paper presents methods of formal prediction models' construction in the absence of the past data. Subjective opinions of experts on the development of a projected phenomenon were used to evaluate the parameters of such models. Thus, those models are called subjective. There are considered four subjective prediction models: a development trend model, Rogers's diffusion model and Bass's diffusion model, ADBUDG model. On the basis of each of the models, as an illustration of theoretical considerations, were built predictions of energy production from renewable energy sources in Poland in the years 2010-2050. In the conclusions part, the individual models are evaluated from the standpoint of their usefulness as well as their advantages and disadvantages in building long-term forecasts of new technologies' development are discussed.;"Experts' forecasts; Subjective models";"Poradowska, K.; University of Economics in WroclawPoland; email: konstancja.poradowska@ue.wroc.pl";International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA;;;;;English;Inniv.

Nonetheless roadmaps can be applied to exploratory studies as well. The latter are aimed at identifying key potentially transformative events, whose dynamics could be influenced by a wide range of externalities. Trends in some fields appear to dominate and shape movement in other areas. Roadmapping allows visualizing and assessing probabilities of cross-impact between various areas of forecasting thus identifying possible scenario bifurcations as well as new risks and opportunities. This paper describes the exploratory roadmap being developed for the Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight 2030. According to that roadmap, evolution to 2020 closely follows macroeconomic trends. However, in regard to technological development, either the «rapid inflation» scenario or the «gradual way out of the crisis» one, the rate is the same, in our view. After 2020, the dominating role in evolution is expected to shift to «global technologies». These technologies are grouped into six thematic areas according to countries' S&T priorities, i.e. energy, transport, information and communications technologies (ICTs), medicine, nanotechnologies, and production systems. The most influential scenario bifurcation in the roadmap emerges from the field of energy. Depending on the actual scenario - «the expansion of alternative energy sources» or «the widespread use of non-conventional hydrocarbon fuels» - the global economy will experience rapid growth or slow stagnation respectively.;"Exploratory forecast; Long-term forecasting; Macroeconomic trends; Normative forecast; Scenario bifurcation; Scenarios; Technology roadmaps";;National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics;1995459X;;;;Russian;Foresight Russ.;2-s2.0-84886736437;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Successfully dealing with the growing impacts of change on social-ecological systems depends on our ability to anticipate change. But traditional scientific tools are blunt instruments for studying a future that does not exist. We propose that futures research, a transdisciplinary field of inquiry that has been developing for more than 50 years, offers an underused but fruitful set of approaches to address this important challenge. A few futures research methods-notably several forms of scenario analysis-have been applied to environmental issues and problems in recent years. But futurists have developed an array of other useful methods for exploring possible, plausible, and preferable futures, important insights into the nature of change, and perspectives for thinking creatively and deeply about the future. We present an overview of futures research and its potential to enrich environmental planning and policy by offering a cross-fertilization of new ideas and approaches, providing a more complete view of emerging environmental problems, and facilitating the development of strategies to increase adaptive capacity and deal more effectively with surprises. © 2012 by the author(s).;"Environmental futures; Futures research; Scenarios; Strategic foresight";"Bengston, D.

It is important that mass communication, with its virtual product is related to two other sectors: telecommunications and information and communication technology. Technological transformations affect these three industries alike; the growth of bandwidth, convergence of terminals and growth of their computational performance are transforming products and markets in all three. Long-term trends in these markets have been well defined by a range of industrial experts. The conclusion of the paper provides recommendations for the revision of public policy. The authors note only a few new tendencies in services and products. However, wide diffusion of these trends due to cheap technologies will lead to radical changes in the sector. New markets will appear as a result of expansion and adjustment of industrial relations between agents, previously independent of each other. Key trends are the abandonment of linear-media in favor of ""user-controlled"" consumption, with a growing amount of content produced by the user, and the spread of social interactions. The trends are interrelated and determine the transformation of business models, the sources of income, and the value of goods produced by the media industry. The most negative trend according to experts is ""deprofessionalization"" of content, which poses a risk for institutionalized forms of media. With such turbulent changes regulation in mass communications will inevitably undergo transformation. Henceforth it will not be able to rely upon content filtering and setting quotas. Instead the regulation should be built upon enabling a diversity of information sources to create the news agenda at the request of the audience.";"Content; Foreñasting; Information technologies; Long-term trends; Mass communications; Media market; Scenario analysis";;National Research University;1995459X;;;;Russian;Foresight Russ.;2-s2.0-84884520189;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of the most widespread approaches is the development of scenarios, which are alternative hypothetical futures. Research has indicated, however, that the reality of how professionals go about employing scenarios is often starkly at odds with the theory - a finding that has important ramifications for how the resulting images of the future should be interpreted. It also shows the need for rewriting and updating theory. This book, based on an intensive five year study of how experts actually go about assessing the future, provides a groundbreaking examination of foresighting in action. Obtained via ethnographic techniques, the results lay bare for the first time the real processes by which scenarios are made. It is also the first book to examine foresighting for public policy, which is so often overlooked in favour of business practice. From handling of discontinuity to historical determinism, the analysis reveals and explains why foresight is difficult and what the major pitfalls are. Each chapter ends with a toolkit of recommendations for practice. The book aims to help readers to reflect on their own practices of public-oriented foresight and thus to foster a deeper understanding of the key principles and challenges. Ultimately, this will lead to better informed decision making. © Marjolein B. A. van Asselt, 2010.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The companies have become more open in their futures research process and have come down the ivory tower to practice a more interactive way of looking at the future. The required broad view of the future has also taught the companies not to just collect and analyze as much information as possible but also to give room to intuition and listen very good to external experts. Lastly, the companies more and more use their network to look for 'weak signals' in their business environment thereby attempting to make their companies much more agile so that having a very long view of the future is no longer a dominant approach. Overall, the research shows a contingency perspective towards looking at the future. The findings of this explorative research have been assessed by comparing those to three other studies on the link between futures research and innovation.;"Forecast; Foresight; Futures research; Innovation; Scenarios; The Netherlands";;Institute of Industrial Engineers;;;;;English;IIE Annu.

The methodological approach used for scheduling N-fertilization is based on forecast of the daily amount of N uptake by the crop and of N available into the root zone in order to fulfil N-crop requirements by the soundest N supply to the soil, as follows: N-fertilization = N-crop uptake-N-soil availability. The DSS works on a daily basis through a) the estimation of a daily dry mass accumulation on the basis of cumulated degree days; b) the derivation of the daily N-uptake by the crop as a function of the estimated accumulation of DM using specific N-dilution curves; c) the estimation of the daily N-available in the soil intercepted by the roots (mineral and mineralizable); d) the daily N-balance (N-uptake-N-available in the soil); e) make a decision on the N-application rate and application scheduling on the base of the balance result and on the moment of the growing cycle. The program allows to simulate crop growth by using historical meteorological data (multi-annual averaged daily minimum and maximum temperature) specific of the area where the farm is located and thus producing a foresight N-fertilization plan. © ISHS.";"Crop growth model; Degree days; Fertilization management; N dilution curve";"Elia, A.; Department of Agro-Environmental Science, Chemistry and Plant Protection, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy";International Society for Horticultural Science;5677572;9,79E+12;;;English;Acta Hortic.;2-s2.0-84863692550;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But this book argues that this does not place it beyond the reach of a science that can help to explain and perhaps even to predict social behaviour. As a system made up of many interacting agents – people, groups, institutions and governments, as well as physical and technological structures such as roads and computer networks – society can be regarded as a complex system. In recent years, scientists have made great progress in understanding how such complex systems operate, ranging from animal populations to earthquakes and weather. These systems show behaviours that cannot be predicted or intuited by focusing on the individual components, but which emerge spontaneously as a consequence of their interactions: They are said to be ‘self-organized’. Attempts to direct or manage such emergent properties generally reveal that ‘top-down’ approaches, which try to dictate a particular outcome, are ineffectual, and that what is needed instead is a ‘bottom-up’ approach that aims to guide self-organization towards desirable states. This book shows how some of these ideas from the science of complexity can be applied to the study and management of social phenomena, including traffic flow, economic markets, opinion formation and the growth and structure of cities. Building on these successes, the book argues that the complex-systems view of the social sciences has now matured sufficiently for it to be possible, desirable and perhaps essential to attempt a grander objective: To integrate these efforts into a unified scheme for studying, understanding and ultimately predicting what happens in the world we have made. Such a scheme would require the mobilization and collaboration of many different research communities, and would allow society and its interactions with the physical environment to be explored through realistic models and large-scale data collection and analysis. It should enable us to find new and effective solutions to major global problems such as conflict, disease, financial instability, environmental despoliation and poverty, while avoiding unintended policy consequences. It could give us the foresight to anticipate and ameliorate crises, and to begin tackling some of the most intractable problems of the twenty-first century. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.;;;Springer Berlin Heidelberg;;"9783642290008; 9783642289996";;;English;Why Society is a Complex Matter: Meeting Twenty-First Century Challenges with a New Kind of Science;2-s2.0-84955735338;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Studies have shown that with this warming trend, sea ice and glaciers are melting and thus sea levels are rising. However, the situation might be more severe than originally anticipated. The ice is retreating a lot more quickly than was projected, with an absolute low point in 2007. a second low point occurred in 2008 and September 2010 provided us with the third lowest sea ice extent in the satellite record. Maybe even more important than the decline in sea ice extent, is the fact that the ice volume is decreasing with it. The ice pack is becoming more and more vulnerable to melting due to the decline in the amount of old, thick ice and it appears that five-year or older ice has nearly completely disappeared from the Arctic. This Arctic melt opens up new possibilities for (trans) Arctic shipping. Of particular importance was key finding # 6 of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) report, which stated that ""Reduced sea ice is very likely to increase marine transport and access to resources"". Indeed, due to this warming trend, the Northwest Passage, the Northern Sea Route and maybe even the Central Arctic Route in the future, are opening up. In the fall of 2008 the first commercial ship transported cargo from the east through the Northwest Passage and in 2009 two German cargo vessels, the MV Beluga Fraternity and the MV Beluga Foresight were the first foreign flag ships to sail the entire Northern Sea Route. This year navigation has really picked up in the Northern Sea Route and therefore 2010 can be viewed as the breakthrough year for trans-Arctic commercial shipping, with more voyages planned for 2011. These new developments are again raising questions concerning the outstanding maritime boundaries in the area, the legal status of the waters concerned, the efficiency of current solutions and the extent of national jurisdiction. As national legal regimes will need to adapt, substantial changes are to be expected to meet these new challenges. Meanwhile, as shipping increases, the stress on the already fragile environment increases with it, which results in great concerns regarding the preservation and protection of the environment. Environmentalists warn about the dangers of vessel-source pollution and emphasize that the lack of infrastructure, information and mandatory legislation, are issues that should urgently be addressed at an international level. This paper will provide insights about recent developments in the Arctic in the abovementioned areas.";;;Martinus Nijhoff Publishers;18727158;9,79E+12;;;English;Cent.

Current emission inventories, impacts of forecasts, and previously published scenarios report usually total transport emissions, without focusing specifically on long-distance freight. Since detailed statistics were unavailable, a quantitative model was developed to estimate the figures from existing data. The model was used to estimate the emissions and energy consumption of future transport systems described in the business-as-usual forecasts and in the backcasts.

Design/methodology/approach: Technology e-transfer is an innovating concept popularised in industry, especially in SMEs, developed in the course of the previously pursued e-foresight research of modern knowledge concerning the priority innovative materials surface technologies and the forecast directions of their development. Findings: Technology e-transfer embracing e-information, e-advisory and e-learning, is an efficient method of disseminating the results of technology e-foresight of materials surface engineering within industry. Research limitations/implications: If technology e-transfer is used in the Open Access mode, anyone, for free and at the same terms, has access to a database on the priority innovative technologies of materials surface engineering and the anticipated directions of their development, which has a positive effect on the development of a knowledge- and innovation-based economy. Practical implications: The idea of disseminating the results of e-foresight of materials surface engineering by way of technology e-transfer is especially attractive for small- and medium-sized companies lacking the funds required to perform their own research in this scope. Originality/value: The concept of technology e-transfer represents the Authors' original contribution into the development of Computer Aided Knowledge Management. © Copyright by International OCSCO World Press.;"E-delphix method; Surface engineering; Technology e-foresight; Technology e-transfer; The critical technologies book";"Dobrzańska-Danikiewicz, A.

Accordingly, this article discusses the concepts related to future studies and their historical trajectory by presenting the various classifications and approaches found in the literature characterizing their relations and theoretical gaps. Therefore, using the principles of the dialectical method, a descriptive theoretical study was conducted using literature review as the research method. This study presents a characterization of the concepts found in the studies investigated that are considered benchmark creating a timeline. Through a comparative analysis of the terms found, the focus was developing a conceptual framework suitable for the Brazilian scientific scenario concerning future studies. It was concluded that this is not a recent topic, and the existing concepts/classifications have received several contributions updating and expanding its specifications and operational complexities, since the 1950's. The originally generic approach has been replaced with more specific visions related to individual methods of investigation and future building achieving greater relevance, consistency, and replicability. The adoption of a certain classification (and its methods) must result from a historical and cultural identity with the context of application. It is believed that this research contributes to avoiding and or clearing theoretical misunderstandings, conceptual errors, or broad and indiscriminate use of synonymous concepts, which are sometimes found in the literature, presenting opportunities for future studies technical development.;"Forecast; Foresight; Future scenarios; Future studies; Prospective";"Schenatto, F.J.A.; Universidade Tecnológica Federal Do Paraná-UTFPR, Via do Conhecimento, Km 1, CEP 85503-390, Pato Branco, PR, Brazil; email: schenatto@utfpr.edu.br";;0104530X;;;;Portuguese;Gestao Prod.;2-s2.0-84856672053;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Human judgment, however, is subject to numerous cognitive biases. In this paper, we study the effects of the desirability bias in foresight. We analyze data from six Delphi studies and observe that participants systematically estimate the probability of occurrence for desirable (undesirable) future projections higher (lower) than the probability for projections with neutral desirability. We also demonstrate that in the course of a multi-round Delphi process, this bias decreases but is not necessarily eliminated. Arguably, the quality of decisions based on Delphi results may be adversely affected if experts share a pronounced and common desirability for a future projection. Researchers and decision makers have to be aware of the existence and potential consequences of such a desirability bias in Delphi studies when interpreting their results and taking decisions. We propose a post-hoc procedure to identify and quantify the extent to which the desirability bias affects Delphi results. The results of this post-hoc procedure complement traditional Delphi results; they provide researchers and decision makers with information on when and to which extent results of Delphi-based foresight may be biased. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.";"Delphi; Delphi based decision quality; Desirability bias; Foresight";"Ecken, P.; EBS Business School, Soehnleinstrasse 8F, 65201 Wiesbaden, Germany; email: philipp.ecken@ebs.edu";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Herman Kahn, the father of modern scenario planning, underlined the importance of thinking the unthinkable in a significant scenario study. Blessed with high intelligence, an assertive personality and the research capabilities of the RAND Corporation,he could rely on genius forecasting. But how can this foresight be creative as well as simultaneously credible and objective if one does not possess Kahn's genius? In this article, we assess the incorporation of expert knowledge via the Delphi technique into scenario planning as a promising option. We discuss possible combinations and identify the span of design alternatives in the existing body of Delphi-based scenario studies through a systematic research review and provide recommendations on how a Delphi-based scenario study should be designed to ensure quality. We recommend focusing on the integration of the Delphi technique only in one phase of the scenario approach. In this way, the design options can be intentionally adjusted to the particular function. We further offer recommendations on how to accomplish this. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;"Delphi technique; Foresight; Quality criteria; Scenario development; Scenario planning; Systematic research review";"Nowack, M.; Technische Universitt Dresden, Mnchnerplatz 1/3, 01062 Dresden, Germany; email: ema@mailbox.tu-dresden.de";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

An efficient insurance system must guarantee that loss adjustment is performed fairly and transparently, so that the continual review and modification of adjustment rules becomes especially important. The present study develops and applies a methodology based on the subjective information compiled by experts to evaluate the modification of the Specific Loss Adjustment Rule for Fruit Crops under real market conditions.The results show that the method employed comes forward as a valid option to provide reliable information, as well as other economic and social advantages, in the absence of alternative statistical sources. The validity of the study has been proved by its utility, as the results were extremely useful for drawing up a new Official Adjustment Rule. This application opens up an interesting field of development for this technique, which will enable the proposed methodology to be applied to similar studies in the context of agricultural insurance loss adjustment. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;"Agricultural insurance; Delphi; Foresight study; Loss adjustment; Subjective information";"Mateos-Ronco, A.; Department of Economic and Social Sciences, Universidad Politcnica de Valencia, Camino de Vera s/n, 46071 Valencia, Spain; email: almaron@esp.upv.es";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

We demonstrate how the real-time (computer-based) method increases the efficiency of the process, accommodates expert availability, and reduces drop-out-rates. Modifications in the Delphi procedure (e.g. change of iteration principle) not only increase efficiency but also change the nature and process of the survey technique itself. By identifying and analysing three individual effects (initial condition effect, feedback effect, and iteration effect) we examine whether the modifications in the survey process cause deviations to the survey results. Empirical data obtained from both conventional as well as real-time Delphi studies is analysed based on multiple statistical analyses. The research findings indicate that significant differences between the two Delphi survey formats do not exist and final survey results are not affected by changes in the survey procedure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;"Conventional Delphi; Foresight; Methodological comparison; Real-time Delphi";"Gnatzy, T.; Center for Futures Studies and Knowledge Management, EBS Business School, Soehnleinstrasse 8A, 65201 Wiesbaden, Germany; email: tobias.gnatzy@ebs.edu";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

By the term standardisation, we broadly mean the process of developing and implementing technical standards within a standardisation body. Underlining the explorative nature of this paper, we describe the process of identifying future fields of standardisation.To provide a systematic forecasting view on complex science and technology fields, a combination of quantitative indicator-based analyses and qualitative in-depth Delphi surveys is choosen. Firstly, statistical analyses of suitable indicators are used to identify dynamic developments in such fields. Secondly, to identify detailed challenges for future standardisation, qualitative Delphi surveys are conducted. To collect and evaluate relevant issues the respective expert communities were included. They were identified by using information derived from the science and technology databases used.The paper concludes with the assessment of the chosen approach and give practical insights for its feasibility based on a review of the existing literature on the Delphi methodology. In addition, an outlook for further improvements and other possible fields of application is given. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;"Delphi; Science and technology indicators; Standardisation foresight";"Goluchowicz, K.; Berlin Institute of Technology (TU Berlin), School of Economics and Management, Mller-Breslau-Strae, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; email: kerstin.goluchowicz@tu-berlin.de";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Standing at the heart of their businesses, procurement managers need to limit the negative impact of the crisis. Restructuring and cost killing are usually the first responses. However, some buyers are pioneering a new kind of collaborative management that, instead of increasing the pressure on suppliers and reducing risk-taking to a minimum, advocates taking new initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to present a new, ""collaborative buyer"" approach to the management of the procurement function. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research uses a constructivist methodology based on interviews of 12 buying experts. It develops scenarios and identifies the features of collaborative procurement. In order to map the future of the procurement function, this research looks at the expectations and forecasts of the players involved. The aim is a comprehensive, long, rational, ownership approach that is action oriented. Findings: The paper offers an overview of new, foresight-based procurement practices, based on the subtle but precise perception of the faint signs of coming change by people immersed in the procurement sector. The procurement professionals agreed to co-construct a new buyer profile resulting from changes to the old buyer profile and the convergence of other occupations with new skills and expertise. Originality/value: The aim is to carefully co-construct a picture of the future of the procurement function. The paper presents new forms of internal and external collaboration, the roles and specific skills of this type of ""buyer of the future,"" and how the globalised economy is becoming an increasingly community based, collaborative virtual environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";"Collaboration; Economic conditions; Economic crisis; Foresight; France; Procurement; Procurement function; Supply chain management";"Allal-Chérif, O.; Operations Management and Information Systems Department, BEM Management School, Bordeaux, France; email: oihab@bem.edu";;9600035;;;;English;Int.

In early 2007, the Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) was commissioned to offer a forward-looking review of the Livable Communities strategy of AARP, originally, the American Association of Retired Persons (with 37 million members, AARP is the largest non-profit organization in the US) [1]. This article summarizes the process and results of that project. It constitutes a case study in the evaluation of a large organization's plans from a strategic foresight perspective. Findings from this investigation suggest that many large-scale trends in the U.S., including urban sprawl, rising energy costs, climate change, and fiscal challenges are likely to work against efforts to make communities more livable. On the basis of these findings, IAF recommended that the association take a broad approach to livability, developing strategies that counter these negative trends while also improving the lives of older people. AARP is one of the best suited organizations to make such a long-term commitment. © 2011.;;"Bezold, C.; Institute for Alternative Futures 100N.

In order to ela borate a model suitable for medium-term forecasts and recommendations, we have defined eight major elements of Information Society that characterise the evolution of the corresponding digital economy. The evolution of the overall system is described by a discrete-continuous-event system, where the mutual impacts of each of the elements are represented within state-space models. Technological trends and external economic decisions form inputs, while feedback loops allow us to model the influence of technological demand on IT, R&D, production, and supply of DSS. The technological characteristics of the product line evolution modelled in this way can provide clues to software providers about future demand. They can also give R&D and educational institutions some idea on the most likely directions of develop¬ment and demand for IT professionals. As an example, we will model the evolution of decision-support systems and recommenders for 3D-internet-based e-commerce, and their impact on technological progress, consumption patterns and social behaviour.

Delphi techniques are used to complete the green technology foresight with an improved questionnaire and statistical model, compared with the traditional one.

Such retrospective comparisons are quite rare, if only because the forecasters and other drafters of long-term planning studies prefer to look to the future rather than the past. However, as is shown in this article by Marie-Hélène Laurent, François Cattier, Dominique Osso and Prabodh Pourouchottamin who have attempted to carry out such a retrospective analysis of foresight studies on energy demand, such comparisons have a great deal to teach us. After specifying the nature of the studies analysed (forecasts, foresight studies, projections), what they cover and the way they were elaborated (the use of a reference scenario in particular), the authors - though cautious as to the relevance of such retrospective comparisons - ask themselves three questions. First, was the study wrong and, if so, to what extent and in what direction? Then, why was it wrong? They show, for example, the various types of possible error (trajectory, trend, variability etc.) and their impact, the importance of the quality of hypotheses and of the profile of the authors involved, and the lessons that ensue. Lastly, posing the question of the seriousness of the errors found, Laurent et al. seek to put things into perspective: on the one hand, retrospective comparisons help to refine the analysis and reduce the potential risks of error in such exercises; on the other, they enable us better to grasp consumption systems dynamically, to identify the sectors in which it is most difficult to bring about change, and to refine the timescales of the measures to be implemented - the key element in all foresight studies being that the hypotheses and scenarios should be communicated with the greatest possible transparency.";;Laurent, M.-H.;;0337307X;;;;French;Futuribles Anal.

Therefore, the authors propose a methodology called ""the methodology of future coverage"", which measures how much the strategy oriented to the future effectively covers trends and megatrends. In other words, it helps to check the contents and the coherence of the firm' vision and products and those of the trends that will have relevance for the future of the industry, and this process supplies firms with supplementary information on how to improve. The authors tested this methodology and exemplified its use via the Eurotech case study, employing longitudinal analysis. The methodology can be useful as a tool for diagnosing the coherence between trends and company strategy. Moreover, from a dynamic point of view, it can be used as a tool to check on the company's progress in following up on trends by adapting its strategy over time. Finally, the methodology can be also used as a tool for cross-comparison of the ""level of future orientation"" among companies in the same industry. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.";"Case study; Coherence; Corporate Foresight; Future coverage; Strategic direction; Trend";"Battistella, C.; University of Udine, Department of Electric, Managerial and Mechanical Engineering, via delle Scienze 208, 33100 Udine, Italy; email: cinzia.battistella@uniud.it";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Findings: The paper finds that the practical challenge of taking a ""scenaric stance"", as articulated in ""Facing the fold"", cannot be addressed without going beyond the typically epistemological solutions proposed by most futurists. Research limitations/implications: The challenge is not finding ways to ""know"" the future, rather to find ways to live and act with not-knowing the future. Practical implications: The ""scenaric stance"" points to a way of embracing what Henri Bergson calls ""the continuous creation of unforeseeable novelty.""

In so doing, however, backcasting may run the risk of obscuring significant differences in current lived experience, negating alternative problem framings and normatively derived views of what constitutes sustainability. This paper reports an innovative UK attempt to develop an inclusive 'bottom-up' community foresight process for urban sustainability research. Unlike most backcasting studies, the methodology was initially grounded in an exploration of the community participants' current lived experience and understandings of sustainability. Given the particular purpose of the study the primary outcome from the work was structured around the articulation of a 'community-led' agenda for urban sustainability research, rather than an explicit normative vision and transition pathway. However, the methodology could easily be adapted for use in other contexts, and showed potential to contribute to the formation of local 'transition arenas': facilitating network formation and building capacity for local sustainability initiatives and experiments. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"Citizens' science; Community foresight; Transition management; Up-stream engagement; Urban sustainability";"Eames, M.; Low Carbon Research Institute, Bute Building, King Edward VII Avenue, Cardiff, CF10 3NB, United Kingdom; email: EamesM@Cardiff.ac.uk";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

A methodological framework for participatory backcasting is presented, after which a conceptual framework is developed to describe and evaluate the impact of backcasting experiments. Three cases are analysed: (1) Novel Protein Foods and meat alternatives; (2) Sustainable Household Nutrition; and (3) Multiple Sustainable Land-use in rural areas. The cases show that participatory backcasting can lead to substantial follow-up and spin-off, but that is not always the case. Substantial follow-up and spin-off after five to ten years is predominantly found at the level of niches, and can be seen as potential seeds for future system innovations. The emergence of follow-up and spin-off comes along with the diffusion of the visions generated in the backcasting experiment. The visions provide orientation (where to go) and guidance (what to do). Visions also show both stability and flexibility. Factors that influence the extent of impact and spin-off of backcasting are identified, with a focus on stakeholders, learning and visions. Finally, relevance for system innovation theory, governance and policy as well as research recommendations are briefly discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.";"Future vision; Learning; Participatory backcasting; Socio-technical transitions; Stakeholders; Sustainability foresight; System innovation";"Quist, J.; Technology Dynamics and Sustainable Development Section, Faculty of Technology, Policy Management, Delft University of Technology, P.O.

Design/methodology/approach – Counterfactual analysis, scenario analysis and peripheral vision are presented as the constituting methodological triad through which scenario thinking comes into representation. Findings – Scenario thinking is a temporally emerging everyday organizational practice. By placing emphasis on the mundane and taken for granted activities that come together to form the nexus of the practice, often deep underlying structures of organizational behaviour contributing to scenario thinking can be theorised. Research limitations/implications – The practice conceptualisation of scenario thinking inverts and challenges existing management and practitioners' conventional understanding of the practice as an episodic phenomenon in waiting to be facilitated by an expert with specific end points and conformity. Practical implications – Foresight practitioners and researchers can use this as an analytical starting point for the study and theorising of scenario thinking in self organized groups. Originality/value – The paper provides a new angle of vision to extend understanding of the development and theorising of scenario thinking in autonomous working groups. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited;"Innovation; Product innovation; Strategic management; Working practices";"Sarpong, D.; Strategy and International Management at Bristol Business School, University of the West of England, Bristol, United Kingdom";;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-79953270127;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The purpose of the study is to examine how domain experts look at the practice of foresight in general, and perceive its overall impact on policy making in particular, in the setting of Japanese foresight conducted in the past 15. years. There are two tasks for doing that in this study: to know the views of scientists and engineers who participated in foresights on the impact of foresights they participated; and to know the effect of respondent's characteristics on their perceptions on impact.There are two main findings of this study. First, the impact on policy making perceived by domain experts who participated in foresight activities in Japan is not very high. Second, there are different patterns of perception on the size of the impact on policy making depending on ages, organizations, member status during foresight, and science and technology areas, and habit of following the situation in general looking for any impacts after the foresight. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.";"Delphi method; Foresight; Impact; Perception; Policy making; Survey";"Yoda, T.; Institute for Future Technology, 2-6-11 Fukagawa, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135-8473, Japan; email: t.yoda@iftech.or.jp";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Past researches have typically used SA to attain foresight into future issues that focus on a short-term time frame. Nevertheless, SA implies some weaknesses in that it is unable to define the transition between time states clearly and it cannot meaningfully explain how to forecast long-term uncertainty effectively and how to link present and future situations. Based on these weaknesses, we established a Markov SA (MASA) model that integrates the concept of vision, linking analysis planning, Markov chain, and SA so that we can improve the existing model for SA. The MASA model not only solves our insufficient information problem for a complete SA model but also classifies four categories for forecasting future events. The four categories that can confirm a future trend are (1) state of constancy, (2) state of disappearance, (3) state of change, and (4) state of uncertainty. This paper introduces the principles and application of the MASA model. A sample case study is given to explain how the MASA model can be applied.

For fisheries and aquaculture, 33 SPs exist at the state level and 7 at the national level, 1 of them for tilapia. The objective of this study is to carry out a foresight analysis (FA) of 4 tilapia SPs in Mexico-for the States of Colima, Sonora, Tabasco and Yucatán-analyzing their 2018 vision for the development of the tilapia chain. FA provides an integral vision of both the internal and external environments, identifying the key factors for each SP and helping to develop the best strategies in order to compete successfully. Sonora, Tabasco and Yucatán identify marketing aspects as key elements for their 10-year future: adding value to the product by means of new processing technologies, developing their own brand, and identifying and differentiating their product based on sanitary issues. Colima focuses its industry future success on efficiency improvements. Finally, the main technological disruptions identified by the 4 states are the incremental use of information technology, product and process certification, new hatcheries with genetically-improved fry, and new processing methodologies developed and/or applied. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight analysis; Scenarios; Supply chain; Tilapia";"Martínez-Cordero, F.J.; Laboratorio de Economía Acuícola, CIAD, A.C.

This study focuses on long distance freight transport (LDFT) and explores possible sustainable futures through quantitative modeling. The evaluation was part of European foresight process between researchers, policy makers and freight companies (FREIGHTVISION). Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy demand of road, rail and inland waterways were estimated for an EU-27 in 2005. Development was extrapolated to 2050 based on technology and freight performance forecasts. Stakeholders found the forecasted GHG emissions and fossil fuel share unsustainable, so alternative futures were developed with backcasting. The developed emission model was run with random parameter combinations to screen a set of sustainable futures, with an 80% reduction of GHG emissions and fossil fuel share. Freight transport performance was not controlled in the backcasts, but several sustainable futures were found if significant changes in transport efficiency and energy mix are implemented. In spite of agreeing on the importance of reducing emissions, stakeholders had difficulties in choosing a preferred technological future. Simple models were found to be an effective tool for communicating the influence of various measures. Further research is recommended to screen preferable technological roadmaps from the broad range of available futures. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;"Fossil fuel share; Greenhouse gas emissions; Model";"Mattila, T.; Finnish Environment Institute SYKE, Mechelininkatu 34a, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; email: tuomas.mattila@ymparisto.fi";;3014215;;ENPYA;;English;Energy Policy;2-s2.0-79952069963;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach - Through an intuitive-logical process adapted to the specific purposes of the research, four alternative scenarios of the evolution of the industry were developed. The exercise involved three workshops, with the participation of a group of experts, academics, representatives from industry and local government. Findings - Based on the nature and dynamics of the key forces and trends, the four scenarios identified are: southern experience; global emotions; ""sin surprise""; and non-charming Portugal. In all scenarios there is increased global competition amongst tourist destinations. A desire for authenticity opens the opportunity for Portugal as a tourist destination but it also poses challenges for managers and policy makers. These scenarios are of practical use for managers, policy makers and other practitioners as they provide a framework for the development and assessment of robust strategies and policies, i.e. strategies that will survive several kinds of external development. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the knowledge of scenario methods in practice and to help policy planners and managers recognize, consider and reflect on uncertainties they are likely to face. The work is also valuable for the international foresight community by discussing the method and addressing some drawbacks of the scenario exercise and recommendations for practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";"Futures markets; Hospitality management; Portugal; Tourism management";"Amorim Varum, C.; Department of Economics, Management and Industrial Engineering, GOVCOPP, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal; email: camorim@ua.pt";;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-79953098272;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The development of a social, not only a strictly scientific vision of the future has become crucial. It appears that the biggest role in this context played technology foresight programs (whose origins go back even to the 70's), integrating traditional methods of forecasting as well as those derived from the social sciences, economics, management science, etc. The paper presents a rich collection of foresight methods identified by the author, a general outline and characteristics of various types of methods, and an innovative classification of technology foresight research methods. Because of the huge complexity of the approach to technological foresight and its further evolution, the ability to classify and identify the typology of methods may be necessary for an orderly and rational way of structuring foresight projects. © 2011 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.;"classification; cluster analysis; research methodology; technology foresight; typology";"Magruk, A.; Management Faculty, Bialystok University of Technology, ul.

In general, the opinions of experts are given more credence than the opinions of non-experts. If objective evidence shows that a malfunction could not have been foreseen even by experts, the possibility of prediction is assumed to have not been possible. Experts can make a proper decision based on expertise related to the automatic machine coverage. However, non-experts might underestimate the coverage and become careful about handling of the system. When a malfunction that an expert cannot foresee occurs in such a situation, and results agree by chance with the forecast of a non-expert, engineers are questioned beyond reason about their ""responsibility"" - a trend particularly marked in relation to computer systems.

In order to elaborate a model suitable for forecasts and recommendations we have defined eight to ten major elements of an IS that characterise its evolution in an adequate way, such as population and its demographics, legal system and IS policies, IT in use, etc. The evolution of the IS is then modelled as a discrete-continuous or discrete-event system, where the mutual impacts of each of the elements are represented within state-space models. Technological trends form inputs, while feedback loops allow us to model the influence of technological demand on IT, R&D, production, and supply. The technological characteristics of the IS evolution modelled in this way can provide clues to IT providers about future demand. They can also give R&D and educational institutions some idea on the most likely directions of development and demand for IT professionals. As an example, we will model the evolution of decision-support systems and their impact on technological progress, consumption patterns and social behaviour in Poland. The results presented here constitute a methodological input to an IS/IT foresight exercise carried out in Poland during the period 2010-2012 and financed by the ERDF.

Miguel Bombarda 20, 1069-035 Lisbon, Portugal;;NÃO;The standard new Keynesian monetary policy problem is presentable as a set of linearized equations, for values of endogenous variables relatively close to their steady-state. As a result, only three possibilities are admissible in terms of long-term dynamics: the equilibrium may be a stable node, an unstable node or a saddle point. Fixed point stability (a stable node) is generally guaranteed for an active monetary policy rule. The benchmark model also considers extremely simple assumptions about expectations (perfect foresight is frequently assumed). In this paper, one inquires how a change in the way inflation expectations are modelled implies a change in monetary policy results, when an active Taylor rule is considered. By assuming that inflation expectations are constrained by the evolution of the output gap, we radically modify the implications of policy intervention: endogenous cycles, of various periodicities, and chaotic motion will be observable for reasonable parameter values.;"Endogenous business cycles; Inflation expectations; Monetary policy; Nonlinear dynamics and chaos; Taylor rule";"Gomes, O.; Lisbon Higher Institute of Accounting and Administration, Av.

In the information age military force is used to influence the intentions of people. Globalisation and networking of operational environments constantly change the traditional order of management. Military organisations are challenged to behave more dynamically and to enhance the knowledge base being more multidisciplinary and agile. The societies today are ""systems of systems"", i.e. complex interactive human-technological systems forming various dynamic multidimensional networks. Thus, the complexity of interactions can only be tracked using conditional probabilities. This makes the decision-making of operations all the more dependent on tacit knowledge of the officers all through the various levels of command-and-control. Human behaviour cannot be forecast in detail, since people can change their rules of interaction thus changing expected outcome. In the past, the general understanding of ontology has been that there are two - order and chaos. Recently the third ontology - complexity - has emerged in scientific approach. In complex systems there is order, but it is emergent rising from the local interaction of independent actors, each of whom behaves according to its own principles, logic and knowledge. The behaviour of complex evolving systems and organisations arises from the intricate interconnectivity of elements - independent actors - within the system and between the system and its operational environment. In this paper, the futures research methodology for creating alternative futures images of information wars is presented. There are recent major efforts to upgrade foresight methodologies available for the global community, such as organisational complexity, six-to-seven pillars of futures methods, HIF-analysis (Hindsight/Insight/Foresight), sense-making and Futures Signals Sense-making Framework (FSSF). Furthermore, to enhance the understanding of network-centric behaviour the new network theories are discussed. In particular, the varying error tolerance of networks is of interest.";"Complexity; Futures; Networks; Robustness; Sense-making; Warfare";"Keskinen, A.; National Defence University, Helsinki, Finland; email: auli.keskinen@iki.fi";;;9,78E+12;;;English;Eur.

This chapter focuses purely on the technical nature of cyberattacks. It examines the current relationship between networked systems and cybercrimes, analyzes the nature of the relationship from a fundamental engineering perspective, and explores systematically where and how future advances in networked systems might influence the evolution of cyberattacks, even inadvertently giving rise to new forms of cybercrimes. Historical data reveals that technological advances in engineering systems design, including communications and transportation, were often accompanied by lack of foresight, thereby inadvertently opening doors to new forms of vulnerabilities following deployment. The greater the extent of the advancement, the deeper the potential chasm and more severe the damage incurred when a clever perpetrator successfully exploits the weaknesses. For example, when the Bell Telephone System employed human operators to switch telephone calls in the early 1900s, anonymous and unauthorized long distance calls were a rarity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;;"Ghosh, S.917 Joel Drive, Tyler, TX 75703, United States; email: sumit.ghosh@ieee.org";Springer Berlin Heidelberg;;9,78E+12;;;English;Cybercrimes: A Multidisc.

It is assessed by analyzing 22 years of both satellite observations of vegetation activity (e.g. NDVI) and climatic data (precipitation, temperature). The specific influence of non-spatial climatic indices such as NAO and SOI is also addressed. The approaches considered for rainfall forecasting include classical Auto-Regressive Moving-Average with Exogenous Inputs (ARMAX) models and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the so-called Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in particular. The use of neural models is proven to be an adequate mathematical prediction tool in this problem due the non-linearity of the problem. These models enable us to predict, with one month foresight, the general rainfall dynamics, with average errors of 44 mm (RMSE) in a test series of 4 years with a rainfall standard deviation equal to 73 mm. Also, the sensitivity analysis in the neural network models reveals that observations in the status of the vegetation cover in previous months have a predictive power greater than other considered variables. Linear models yield average results of 55 mm (RMSE) although they need a large number of error terms (12) to obtain acceptable models. Nevertheless, they provide means for assessing the seasonal influence of the precipitation regime with the aid of linear dummy regression parameters, thereby offering an immediate interpretation (e.g. coherent maps) of the causality between vegetation cover and rainfall. © 2010, IGI Global.;;Universidad de ValenciaSpain;IGI Global;;9,78E+12;;;English;Soft Comp.

Orchestrated with techniques such as the Delphi, future studies were supported by mathematical principles of probability. Several countries have surpassed this stage while moving into strategic foresight. Strategic foresight analyzes the future as a multiple reality. In other words, it means thinking differently and not reading reality in a linear manner. It means accepting that there is not one future but several futures and that one question could have more than one answer.This change has demanded a shift in mentality. The presence of the disciplines in universities is of vital importance. For example, the Technological Institute of Monterrey (Mexico) and the Universidad Externado de Colombia (Bogota) offer foresight and strategy programs at the graduate level.This article describes how different individuals, groups, agencies and institutions in Latin America have emerged thanks to the support provided by the science and technology governmental agencies of each country. The author provides examples from different countries including Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Currently, strategic foresight is slowly gaining recognition and acceptance as a compass for productive sectors and as a generator of competitiveness. However, despite the contributions of strategic foresight, Latin American countries, with the exception of some of the above-mentioned countries, have struggled to take off into the future. The role of strategic foresight can become the driving force behind this awakening, if the challenge of linking global trends with local contextualization through scenarios is accepted. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight analysis; Latin America; Scenarios; Strategic foresight";"Mojica, F.J.; Centro de Pensamiento Estratégico y Prospectiva, Universidad Externado de Colombia, Calle 12 No. 1-17 Este, Bogotá, Colombia; email: francisco.mojica@uexternado.edu.co";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

It analyses how the rationale for its use evolved over time, first providing a 'catchy' title for a study ('Project Foresight'), and then a convenient shorthand for the focus of that study, before eventually coming to formally signify a new approach to looking systematically into the future of science and technology, an inclusive and wide-ranging process that differed appreciably from that of traditional 'technology forecasting'. The paper reflects on the importance of concepts and terminology in the field of science policy research, providing examples of how an inappropriate term or phrase can damn the prospects of the research having an impact on policy, while a more politically astute use of terminology can greatly enhance the probability of making a significant impact. The paper also examines other early uses of the concept of 'foresight' in the United States and Canada at about the same time. In addition, it highlights the conceptual similarities between foresight and la prospective, a novel approach developed in France not just for looking into the future but also for shaping or even 'constructing' the future of our choice, an ambitious aspiration that it shares with foresight. This case-study on the origins and early evolution of 'technology foresight' illustrates the essential importance of terminology in differentiating key concepts in social sciences (where it sometimes gives rise to unfortunate priority disputes), and particularly in the case of policy research. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"Foresight; La prospective; Policy research; Priority; Science; Technology foresight; Terminology";"Martin, B.R.; SPRU, The Freeman Centre, University of Sussex, Brighton, BN1 9QE, United Kingdom; email: B.Martin@sussex.ac.uk";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Despite cultural differences, the two concepts are very similar. Nevertheless, the author argues that prospective is closer to strategic foresight. The prospective attitude does not wait for change and then react; it aims to master expected change (preactivity) and to induce a desired change (proactivity). Preactivity is what guides all approaches to future studies, forecasting, scenario planning and foresight. Proactivity is more voluntarist, and aims to bring about the desired changes by means of strategic planning. This leads to a hopeful message: We just have to rethink the problems to move forward. The author highlights the enduring relevance of several key thinkers ranging from Saint Augustine and Seneca to Gaston Berger and Igor Ansoff. He emphasizes the importance of a collectivity's thinking together about the future and taking action. Overall the article pleads for rigor yet some common sense explains the utility of participatory foresight with simple tools (morphological analysis, prospective workshops).

This term ""Technology Foresight"" took off in the 1990s, as European, and then other, countries sought new policy tools to deal with problems in their science, technology and innovation systems. Large-scale exercises drew in numerous stakeholders as sources of knowledge and influence, and the prominence of these exercises led to ""foresight"" being used much more widely to describe futures activities of many kinds. While few new tools and techniques have been developed in these exercises, they represent an unprecedented diffusion of forecasting, planning and participatory approaches to long-term issues.

So far scholars in the literature on foresight and future studies focused on the techniques and practices for analysing the ""state"" uncertainty about the likely path of evolution of emerging drivers of change. Anyway, less attention was devoted to the ""effect"" uncertainty about the impact of drivers of change on the competitive position of the firm and to the ""response"" uncertainty about how to take advantage of these drivers. These are the main issues we take into account, through a field research on firms that, notwithstanding they were able to properly assess the likely evolution (state uncertainty) of relevant drivers of change in their industry, either were successful or dramatically failed in handling the effect and response uncertainty of these drivers. Moreover, we carried out multiple case studies of some large companies that have established an organizational unit dedicated to strategic foresight. Overall, the results of our research may contribute to improve the effectiveness of strategic foresight and to increase its value added to the planning process of corporate firms, while providing helpful insight to public organizations that promote foresight exercises for enhancing the competitiveness of local firms. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.";"Business micro and macro-environment; Emerging technologies; Foresight; Market and non-market drivers of change; Strategy formulation; Uncertainty";"Vecchiato, R.; Politecnico di Milano, Department of Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering, P.zza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milano, Italy; email: riccardo.vecchiato@polimi.it";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

A large European corporation conducted a project called 'Future Markets-Radar' to identify future market opportunities that lie beyond their present attention. The top executives, who were deeply involved in the project, used a systematic process based on the author's Five Futures Glasses and a comprehensive semantic model of objects of thought, called the Eltville Model and a set of appropriate tools to achieve the goals of the project. The results laid the foundation for future success in future markets, solidified and enriched the corporate strategy and increased the future competence of the people involved. This article proposes a model of the corporate disciplines and goals of future management, a definition of what a future market is, key questions on future markets, a process for early recognition of future markets as well as a summary of the project's results and benefits. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"Corporate strategy; Eltville model; Five futures glasses; Future markets; Radar";"Mićić, P.; FutureManagementGroup, Wallufer Strasse 3a, D-65343 Eltville, Germany; email: PM@FutureManagementGroup.com";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

See L. R. Brown, Building a Sustainable Society, Norton, New York, (1981) and G. MIinati, M.P. Penna, E. Pessa, A conceptual framework for self-organization and merging processes in social systems, in Systems For Sustainability, Plenum Press, New York, (1997). Nowadays, all initiatives must be sustainable and are primarily assessed on that criterion. However, the efforts made to construct specific methods dedicated to building sustainable strategies seem rather weak. Futurists themselves underestimate the relationship between sustainable development and foresight, even if they are talking about sustainable planning. Sustainable planning integrates the objectives of economic development, social justice and inclusion, environment integrity and integrated transport. There is often conflict between short-term economic and fiscal benefits and the longer-term environmental and social implications arising from development. Cf. Ian Miles, Michaël Keenan Practical Guide to Regional Foresight in the United Kingdom, European Commission, DG Research, Brussels (2000) 18. They remain generally unaware that foresight could be a major tool in tackling sustainability as well as one of the best methods of preparing sustainable strategies and policies.Indeed, one of the biggest problems in sustainability approaches is the simplistic way used to define the concept, for instance, by using only the very first part of the 1987 the Bruntland report Our Common Future and by limiting the fields of activity on sustainability to the three pillars of the OECD model: economy, social questions, environment.At the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference (December 2009), it seemed forgotten that sustainability is already an old issue in which futurists were heavily involved at the time of the United Nations Stockholm Environment Conference (1972), in the Limits to Growth Report, published by the Club of Rome (1972). D.L. Meadows, ed., Limits to growth, Earth Island Ltd, London (1972). and in the OECD Interfutures Foresight, spurred on by Jacques Lesourne (1978). INTERFUTURS, Research project on the future development of advanced industrialised societies in harmony with that of developing countries, Final reports, Paris, OECD, 28 September 1978.Since that time (forty years ago!) researchers and consultants have learned how to deal with the concept of sustainability, how to analyze it as an ultimate aim for society as a whole as well as a complex object that needs to be approached with adequate methods such as systemic analysis.As Christian Stoffaës said, the aim of foresight is sustainable development in a changing world. As a result, the ultimate aim of strategic foresight appears to be clear: it is sustainability. This article highlights that fundamental relationship as we see it today. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"Ecology; Strategic foresight; Sustainable development; Sustainable planning";"Destatte, P.; The Destree Institute, 9, avenue Louis Huart, 5000, Namur (Wallonia), Belgium; email: destatte.philippe@institut-destree.eu";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

In an empirical analysis, it seeks to show how the technique of creative competition was used in a scenario-project. The case study shows how and why the technique of creative competition ""worked"". These findings will then be used to explore the broader application of creative competition in organisational foresight. Design/methodology/approach: The study first elaborates theoretically on the difference between ""forecast"" and ""foresight"" and explores how the addition of the organisational dimension to these terms changes their meanings. It then focuses on the organisation that commissioned the study - Rijkswaterstaat - and describes its history with respect to exploring the future and certain other relevant contextual elements of the case study, such as how the project was organised. After that, it conceptualises the RWS2020 project as an example of using ""organisational foresight"" and discusses the concept of ""creative competition"" as a means of bringing ""organisation"" and ""foresight"" closer together. The paper then describes what creative competition was used in the case, how it worked in the case study, and how ""the game"" of creative competition was played. It formulates conclusions on the basis of this case study and then reflects on the findings. Findings: Application of creative competition adds to the integration of foresight in organizational management and organizational change. It supports a more future orientedness in strategic management. Further analysis of other cases is needed to further strengthen theory about application of the method of creative competition. Originality/value: The technique of creative competition is relatively new and has not been theorized as yet. Organizational foresight has been used as a concept, but has hardly been theorized and empirically tested as well. The paper does both, in an exploratory way. It provides interesting insight into the working of organizational foresight for both academics and practitioners, and identifies strategic choices for managers conducting organizational foresight studies with or without the use of creative competition. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";"Competitive strategy; Creative thinking; Organizational change; Organizational planning; Strategic management";"van der Steen, M.; The Netherlands School of Public Administration, The Hague, Netherlands; email: steen@nsob.nl";;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-77956806213;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The aim of the project is to develop a set of roadmaps for metal processing R&D to achieve breakthrough sustainability - ""clean production"".Scenarios, a frequently used Foresight method, are used to set the context for the exercise, inform the design of technology roadmaps and influence the wider policy context. Roadmaps are developed for three process areas of metal manufacture - surface preparation, machining and coating - on four levels including long run visions up to 2020, interim targets up to 2015, key R&D areas and specific project topics. Roadmaps are appraised in the light of alternative scenarios on the future of manufacturing. Promoting sustainability highlights gaps in a ""business as usual"" roadmap, suggesting a different portfolio of research projects. A revised overall scenario is used to shape public policy.R&D teams usually adopt one particular methodology to support resource allocation. However joint use of futures techniques helps if there is uncertainty over competing alternative technologies. Roadmapping often focuses on a single future.

However, there is still a lack of deep understanding of how to reduce perceived risk and improve personal motivation on the adoption of KRSs in previous research. The paper presents social-psychological-technical perspectives to integrate social factors of reduced perceived risk (trust and organizational support) into Motivation Model (MM) and develop a comprehensive framework for assessing and analyzing the interaction of technology with the social, psychological, and behavioral aspects in KRSs. The proposed framework is validated with 528 respondents from teaching hospitals located in Taiwan, which shows that social factors of reduced perceived risk, personal motivation factors, and technology quality factors are three key factors affecting the acceptance of the KRSs. In other words, technological, social, psychological aspects will affect simultaneously behavioral intention in KRSs. Moreover, the psychological aspects are important mediators among technological, social, and behavioral aspects. The findings may be used as theoretical base for future research and offer empirical foresight to managers of organizations in assessing and evaluating the performance of the KRSs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"Knowledge repository systems; Motivation Model (MM); Perceived risk; Trust";"Ho, B.C.T.; Institute of Technology Management, National Chung Hsing University, 250, Kuo Kuang R.d., Taiwan; email: bruceho@nchu.edu.tw";Elsevier Inc.;401625;;;;English;Technol.

Impacts are, however, associated with substantial uncertainties. This paper studies an uncertainty-robust adaptation strategy: strengthening the resilience of the impacted system. This approach is operationalised for the city of Rotterdam, using literature study, interviews, and a workshop. Potential impacts have been explored using national climate statistics and scenarios and a set of 'wildcards' (imaginable surprises). Sea level rise, particularly in combination with storm surge, and enduring heat and drought are the most relevant potential stresses in the area. These can lead to damage, loss of image, and societal disruption. Unclear responsibilities enhance disruption. 'Resilience principles' made the concept of resilience sufficiently operational for local actors to explore policy options. Useful principles for urban resilience include: homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, redundancy, foresight and preparedness/planning, compartmentalisation, and flexible planning/design. A resilience approach makes the system less prone to disturbances, enables quick and flexible responses, and is better capable of dealing with surprises than traditional predictive approaches. Local actors frame resilience as a flexible approach to adaptation that would be more suitable and tailored to local situations than rigid top-down regulations. In addition to a change in policy, it would require a more pro-active mentality among the population. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.;"Climate change adaptation; Resilience; Resilience principles; Uncertainty; Urban planning";"Wardekker, J.A.; Department of Science, Technology and Society, Utrecht University, Copernicus Institute for Sustainable Development and Innovation, Heidelberglaan 2, 3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; email: J.A.Wardekker@uu.nl";;401625;;;;English;Technol.

This paper aims at using a debate that took place in a specific foresight discussion arena on early detection and weak signal analysis, as a constructive epistemic detour to eventually contribute to such a reinforcement of Rosen's anticipatory system proposal. Design/methodology/approach: The author aims at revisiting Rosen's framework with stimulating inputs drawing upon the early detection debates, by first assessing the original concepts brought up by Ansoff in the 1970s and 1980s and its further enhancements by contemporary scholars. A rather constructivist approach is then developed to weak signal analysis, aiming at emphasising the need, in analytical situations involving social system features, for reflexive stages and capacities. Bearing this requirement in mind, the productive value of the framing and meta-framing notions is explored, in order to apply them to Rosen's anticipatory systems and possibly contribute to enriching his original concept. Findings: How effective the framing and meta-framing couple can be for a series of anticipatory issues is described in a detailed manner and, then more specifically, Rosen's anticipatory system concept is revisited in the light of those inputs, aiming at putting into perspective new options for research and anticipation activities in general. Research limitations/implications: The paper is essentially conceptual and based on a rich but disputable detour by early detection and weak analysis issues so as to emphasise key reflexive references and method. However, most of this material is taken from domains rather untypical of Rosennean debates and in addition would need to be completed by a series of supportive cases, but that is beyond the scope and scale of this paper. Practical implications: The paper sets clear distinctions and boundaries for when and when not to apply reflexive steps in a foresight exercise, including in the context of rolling out a Rosen type of approach. Research decision making both in the corporate and policy-making contexts can benefit from such clues and supportive framework conditions. Social implications: Social systems are typically complex and involve multiple perspectives and viewpoints; they concern a series of major challenges to be coped with locally or more globally, at environmental, political, cultural or technological level, and in that category of anticipatory endeavor, the framing/meta-framing epistemic couple may be of great usefulness. Originality/value: Although rather conceptual, the detour proposed by the paper aims at creating a reflexive distance and enriched capability to evaluate one's potential biases and blind spots in anticipatory modelling activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";"Change management; Communication technologies; Complexity theory; Environmental management; Governance; Innovation";"Rossel, P.; College of Management, Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; email: pierre.rossel@epfl.ch";;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-77953260406;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The main results are that if policy had been conducted by means of a Volcker-type rule, it would have been uniformly more restrictive; and if it had been conducted by means of a Greenspan-type rule, it would have been less restrictive. These results are robust to the introduction of real-time data. The paper also evaluates the impact of inflation uncertainty on monetary policy. Real-time Greenbook inflation forecasts reveal that, during the great inflation period, the Fed's staff believed that monetary policy was more restrictive than it turned out to be with the benefit of hindsight.

However, there are remaining barriers that impede a wider implementation of foresight. In particular, the necessities to deal with the future, anticipate change, enhance participation and reduce costs and complexity call for new methods to improve current foresight activities. In this paper, we introduce prediction markets to the field of foresight. Prediction markets are a structured approach to collect and aggregate information from groups and have recently gained attention in forecasting. Prediction markets go beyond simple forecasting and can contribute to foresight by providing advantages in terms of continuous and real-time information aggregation, motivation of participation and information revelation as well as cost-efficiency and scalability. We suggest four promising fields of application for prediction markets to enhance foresight: (1) continuous forecasting and environmental scanning, (2) combining with deliberative approaches, (3) continuous idea generation and (4) expert identification. We conclude by considering prediction markets as a nascent and promising method for foresight and advocate for further research. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.;;"Graefe, A.; Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, P.O.

One possible way of reducing these redispatch costs is to introduce demand response in the form of real-time pricing (RTP), which could allow electricity demand to respond to actual real-time wind resource availability using price signals. A day-ahead unit commitment model with day-ahead wind forecasts and a real-time dispatch model with actual wind resource availability is used to estimate system operations in a high wind penetration scenario. System operations are compared to a perfect foresight benchmark, in which actual wind resource availability is known day-ahead. The results show that wind integration costs with fixed demands can be high, both due to real-time redispatch costs and lost load. It is demonstrated that introducing RTP can reduce redispatch costs and eliminate loss of load events. Finally, social surplus with wind generation and RTP is compared to a system with neither and the results demonstrate that introducing wind and RTP into a market can result in superadditive surplus gains. © 2010 IEEE.;"Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Wind forecast errors; Wind power generation";"Sioshansi, R.; Integrated Systems Engineering Department, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, United States; email: sioshansi.1@osu.edu";;8858950;;ITPSE;;English;IEEE Trans Power Syst;2-s2.0-77951667836;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Indeed, planning, considering, and studying can be important precursors to decision-making, and often seem essential for effective action. This view of premeditation is shared by most humans, a kind of universal ideal, and it carries an additional interesting implication: Even the hint that premeditation occurred can serve as a potent cue indicating voluntary action, both to actors and observers. In legal and moral contexts, for example, actors are seen as especially culpable for the consequences of their actions if those consequences were premeditated, whether or not the premeditation influenced the decision. In this chapter, we review evidence indicating that even irrelevant premeditation can lead people to believe that an action's consequences were under personal control. We present research exploring how various forms of premeditation-including foresight, effortful forethought, wishful thinking, and the consideration of multiple possible outcomes of action-may lead actors to prefer and to feel responsible for action outcomes even when this premeditation has no causal relation to the outcomes. © 2010 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

On the basis of three case studies and 43 interviews, it is shown that building foresight systems through networks of scouts yields several benefits, including the support for sourcing external technologies. Using insights from the three major telecommunication incumbents in Europe, the paper describes and discusses (1) what can be achieved by technology scouting, (2) how a process can be set up, (3) what is important in the design of a scouting network, and (4) the characteristics that should be aimed for when choosing technology scouts.

Numerous water resources system models have been developed to evaluate these resources, yet often fail to adequately address critical aspects, including the transient (e.g., filling) stages of reservoirs, relevant streamflow retention policies and downstream consequences, construction staggering, and the implications of stochastic modeling of variable climate and climate change. This omission has clear economic impacts on benefits and costs and could be pivotal in national policy and decision making. The Investment Model for Planning Ethiopian Nile Development dynamic water resources system model is outlined and applied to address these aspects. For the hydropower and irrigation development projects specified, model results disregarding transient and construction stagger aspects demonstrate overestimations of $6 billion in benefits and 170% in downstream flows compared to model results accounting for these aspects. Benefit-cost ratios for models accounting for transient conditions and climate variability are found to range from 1.2-1.8 under historical climate regimes for the streamflow retention policies evaluated. Climate change scenarios, represented either by changes in the frequency of El Niño and La Niña events or by the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios projections, indicate potential for small benefit-cost increases, but also reflect the potential for noteworthy decreases, relative to the historical climate conditions. In particular, stochastic modeling of scenarios representing a doubling of the historical frequency of El Niño events indicates benefit-cost ratios as low as 1.0, even under perfect foresight optimization modeling, due to a lack of timely water. However, even at this ratio, Ethiopia, at current growth rates, may still be unable to absorb all the potential energy developed, reinforcing the need for significant economic planning and the necessity of securing energy trade contracts prior to extensive expansion. © 2010 ASCE.;"Climatic changes; Economic development; Ethiopia; Stochastic models; Transient response; Water management; Water resources";"Block, P.; International Research Institute for Climate and Society, Columbia Univ., Palisades, NY 10964, United States; email: pblock@iri.columbia.edu";;7339496;;;;English;J.

Design/methodology/approach: Through evaluation, literature search, and personal experiences, five approaches were identified where health foresight has shown strong value: forecasting, scenario planning, Delphi, technology roadmapping, and mass collaboration. For each approach, compelling examples are given, and usage and potential discussed. Findings: There is great opportunity to learn from and expand on past successes, and to customize foresight methods to help decision making in medicine and global health. The range of novel applications to date provides clear evidence that applying foresight methods to health can help prepare for the future, including development of policy and health interventions. Research limitations/implications: Metrics for the impact of health foresight are not widely used, and could be a focus of future research. Practical implications: By seeing compelling examples of diverse foresight methods in medicine and global health, readers will be better equipped to improve health systems and interventions, and prepare for future public health incidents. Originality/value: The paper brings together discussion of a range of health foresight success stories, and suggests potential customizations of foresight for the health field. Readers who are health professionals or involved in making policy for health systems will gain a toolbox for creative planning. Readers who are foresight professionals will gain a better understanding of which foresight methods have shown value in medicine and global health, and potential refinement of foresight techniques for health applications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Delphi method; Forecasting; Health and medicine";"Masum, H.; McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health, Toronto, Canada; email: hassan.masum@mrcglobal.org";;14636689;;;;English;Foresight;2-s2.0-77049115652;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The impact of the foresight on policy was limited, as it did not lead to direct policy measures, nevertheless, it confirmed some issues of major importance to the various stakeholders. © Beech Tree Publishing 2010.;;"Abadie, F.; European Commission Directorate Joint Research Centre, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Edificio EXPO, C/ Inca Garcilaso, s/n, E-41092 Sevilla, Spain; email: fabienne.abadie@ec.europa.eu";;3023427;;;;English;Sci.

Many governments have realized that a single-issue focus is often insufficient in dealing with emerging threats and opportunities. They have therefore started to experiment with strategic foresight that deliberately cuts across the traditional boundaries of policy areas and government departments. This article reviews the foresight activities of three countries that have been at the forefront of this trend: the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the Netherlands. To this end, the article discusses the concept of strategic foresight and explains the two distinct ways in which it contributes to public policy-making: on the one hand, it informs policy by providing more systematic knowledge about relevant trends and developments in an organization's environments; on the other hand, it acts as a driver of reflexive mutual social learning processes among policy-makers that stimulate the generation of common public policy visions. The article concludes by drawing lessons with regard to the key success factors allowing strategic foresight to make an effective contribution to public policy-making. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Foresight and competitive intelligence are two fields that seek to address future oriented environmental scanning. The paper looks at what the domains of foresight and competitive intelligence entail and in particular how competitive technical intelligence can work to integrate and enable competitive agility in foresight positioning. Focus is put on reviewing literature that addresses how foresight impacts R&D project selection. A review is made on foresight programs from around the world based on a recently completed study on Canada's foresight capacity. The authors conclude that agile organizations need to be adaptive and well prepared for tomorrow's challenges and so by integrating competitive technical intelligence, (typically oriented to business needs) with strategic technology foresight, (typically designed to address government priorities for technology investments and innovation policy issues), enterprises will be best positioned to address uncertainties in the technology cycle. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;;"Calof, J.; Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, 55 Laurier Avenue East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; email: calof@telfer.uottawa.ca";;336807;;;;English;R D Manage.;2-s2.0-72449160296;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Igor Ansoff was the prominent reference in the corporate strategy field, especially during the 1960s and 1970s. His bestseller, Corporate Strategy, was the first to give a conceptual framework and a tool box to top managers, consultants and scholars. Recognized as the real pioneer of the field, he was seen by Henry Mintzberg as also the leader of the strategic planning school. The aim of this short article is to show that he was also the father of strategic management and a leader who gave an impressive set of concepts and ideas to promote an integrative and flexible view of strategic planning, strategic foresight, organizational structures and processes. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"'Environment Serving Organizations' (ESOs); H.

It is based on the observation that decision makers often do not seem to fully distinguish between different but seemingly similar decisions and tend to treat such similar decisions in a standardised/habitual way. To capture this, each player's information partition is derived from a similarity grouping of decisions based on the local structure of the game - equality of available actions and analogy of locally foreseen subtrees - and possibly refined by additional information about crucial aspects of past play. The equilibrium concept considered is a (trembling-hand) perfect Nash equilibrium (Selten, 1975), in which players are required to choose the same (routine) behaviour for similar decisions. Based on the approach, it is shown how the Chain Store Paradox (Selten, 1978) can be resolved, and how mixed equilibria in the Centipede Game (Rosenthal, 1981) can be rationalised. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;"Bounded rationality; Chain Store Paradox; Finite automata; Imperfect recall; Limited foresight; Reasoning by analogy";"Wichardt, P.C.; Department of Economics, University of BonnGermany; email: philipp.wichardt@uni-bonn.de";Academic Press Inc.;8998256;;GEBEE;;English;Games Econ.

The Delphi questionnaires were developed throughout the foresight process in relation to the responses given by participants in bibliometric and SWOT analysis conducted prior to the Delphi survey. In this paper, Turkey's renewable energy future is evaluated using the Delphi method. A two-round Delphi research study was undertaken to determine and measure the expectations of the sector representatives regarding the foresight of renewable energies. First and second round of Delphi study were carried out by using online surveys. About 382 participants responded in the first round of the Delphi questionnaire yielding a respond rate of 20.1%, whereas 325 participants responded at the second round yielding a respond rate of 84.9%. About 50% of Turkey's energy demand was foresighted to be met by renewable energies around 2030. The results showed that all types of renewable energies would not only provide economic and environmental benefits but also improve living standards. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The article discusses not only the expert sights on hydrogen technologies but also all bibliometrical approaches. The results showed that the hydrogen economy will enhance innovations as well as economic prosperities with the support of appropriate policies. Formulating such policies requires a timely and detailed understanding of the latest R&D trends and developments in science and technology policy in all developed countries, and the comprehensive analysis of these developments to enable accurate predictions of future science and technology trends. Therefore, we hope that this study can shed a light on the future use of hydrogen technologies, especially for policy makers. © 2009 Professor T.

Research Question/Issue: Why did the majority of directors prior to the financial crisis not have the foresight to predict the problems of taking on too much risk? We analyze whether executives' characteristics affect strategic choices due to bounded rationality, as proposed by the theory of upper echelons. The literature has thus far not empirically opened this black box. Relying on psychological economics, we develop hypotheses under which conditions expertise and gender can lead to biased information-processing. Research Findings/Insights: To test the hypotheses, we propose a two-study methodology and take the financial crisis as a natural experimental setting. In Study 1, we analyze individual phenomena and show that under conditions of uncertainty, the processing of information by financial experts and men is worse than by non-financial experts and women. In Study 2, we test these findings for organizational phenomena. We show that banks with a higher percentage of financial experts within TMTs perform better in stable environments, but are more negatively affected by the financial crisis. Theoretical/Academic Implications: An important moderator within the theory of upper echelons is financial market discipline during turbulent periods, explaining why the performance of homogenous TMTs is volatile and why the performance of diverse TMTs is sustainable. The theory can be strengthened by including the insights of psychological economics as a micro-foundation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For a sustainable performance, greater TMT diversity in public companies should be instituted by the board of directors. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;"Bounded rationality; Corporate governance; Information processing; Psychological economics; Theory of upper echelons; Uncertainty";"Rost, K.; Institute of Organization and Administrative Science, University of Zurich, Universitätsstrasse 84, 8006 Zürich, Switzerland; email: katja.rost@iou.uzh.ch";Blackwell Publishing Ltd;9648410;;;;English;Corp.
